Mann Ki Baat, October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Deepjyotirnamostate without enmity
I salute such Divya Jyoti.
To remember this Deepawali, what can be better ideas than that, let us pray to foil the light everywhere, to spread positiveness and to finish the spirit of enemies.
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world.
The special thing is that not only the Indian community participates in this, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens and the social organizations of the country celebrate Diwali festival with full joy.
In a way, India realizes it.
Friends, Festivals of the world had its own attraction.
Our country, which is the country of festivals, there is immense potential for festival tourism.
Be it Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu, it should be our endeavour to connect the people of other states and other countries with the joy of festivals.
We have so many festivals in every state and every region. People from other countries have a lot of interest in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living abroad is very important in promoting festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, it was decided that in the last Mann Ki Baat we had to do something faster in this Diwali.
I used to say - Let us all celebrate this Diwali as the women's power and the success that has achieved it is the honor of India's Laxmi.
Immediately after this, innumerable inspirational stories have been shown in the social media.
Kodipka Ramesh in Warangal wrote on the Namo App that my mother is my power.
When my sons died in 1990, my mother took up the responsibility of five children.
Today, we are five brothers in good business.
Ramesh ji, I bow to our mothers
Geetika Swami, who is active on Twitter, says that for them, Major Khushboo is the Laxmi of India, who is the daughter of a bus driver and has led all women from Assam Rifles.
For poem Tiwari Ji, Laxmi of India is her daughter, which is also her power.
They are proud of their best paintings.
He has also received a very good categories in the CLAT examination.
Megha Jain has written that a 92-year-old woman is providing free water to travellers at Gwalior Railway Station.
Meghaji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of Laxmi in India.
People have said many such stories.
We must read those things, inspire them and do some similar work in our surrounding areas.
I bow down to all these Laxmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the well-known poet of the 17th century, Sanchi Honma had written a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
The same feeling, the word that we are speaking about every Laxmi of India, it seems that the foundation stone was laid in the 17th century itself.
The poems of Kannada are so beautiful, so beautiful and so excellent ideas.
Our daughters, these are our pride and because of the month of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and the future is bright.
My dear countrymen, this is the day on 12th November, 2019 that the 550th light festival of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but also in the whole world.
Our Sikh brothers and sisters have settled in many countries of the world, who are completely dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanak Dev ji.
I can never forget my visit to the Gurudwara of Vanquire and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanak Devji, which I can tell you, but there will be many parts of Mann Ki Baat.
He has always placed service in the highest place.
Guru Nanak Dev ji believed that the service of selfless emotions cannot be made worthless.
He stood firmly against socially evil practices like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji had conveyed his message to the world far and wide.
He was one of the most travellers in our times.
He went to many places and won the hearts of everyone due to his simple nature, humility and simpleness wherever he went.
Guru Nanak Devji made several important religious visits, which were said to be sad.
With the message of goodwill and equality, he met people, saints and sages everywhere, whether it is the north, the east, the west, everywhere.
It is believed that the famous saint Shankardev of Assam had also inspired him.
He visited the holy land of Haridwar.
During his visit to Birla in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the water problem there.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Bidar, who reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, he is dedicated to him.
During a grief, Guru Nanak ji travelled in north, Kashmir and surrounding areas.
This led to a strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji also went to Tibet where people considered him a guru .
He is also worshipped in Uzbekistan where he had gone.
During one of our sadness, he had travelled to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They lived in the minds of millions of people who have followed their teachings and are still following them.
Just a few days ago, the Ambassador of about 85 countries had gone from Delhi to Amritsar.
There he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and this incident took place on the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
All these messengers visited the Golden Temple and had the opportunity to learn about the Sikh tradition and culture.
Thereafter, many Ambassadors took photographs on social media and wrote pride in the best experiences.
I wish Guru Nanak Dev Ji's 550th Prakash Parv will inspire us to bring their ideals and ideals into our lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am confident that on 31st October this date will be remembered by all of you.
This day is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the iron man of India, who was the great hero of the country in the threshold of unity.
On the one hand, Sardar Patel had a wonderful potential to bring people together, while on the other hand, he would have a good deal with those who had ideological differences.
Sardar Patel used to visit small things in a very depth and look at them.
In fact, he was the Man of Details who urges Tapshila.
At the same time, he was an expert in organisation skills.
Thousands of delegates were coming from all over the country to participate in the Congress session in Ahmedabad in 1921.
The responsibility of all the arrangements of the session was on Sardar Patel.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system to the city.
It has been ensured that no one will lack water.
Moreover, he was aware of the stealing of the commodities or shoes of a representative at the venue of the session and we would be surprised to know what Sardar Patel had done.
He urged the farmers to make khadi pieces.
The farmers made such pieces and sold to the representatives.
Wearing their pairs in these pieces and keeping those pieces with you, the pressure of the representative's mind to steal the slaughter was exhausted.
On the other hand, the sale of Khadi has increased considerably.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a remarkable role in the Constituent Assembly.
They have taken important steps to determine fundamental rights, so that there was no distinction on the basis of caste and community.
Friends, As the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had done a great Bhagirath and historical work to integrate the institutions.
Sardar Vallabhbhai was the same thing that he looked at every incident.
In fact, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role in integration of certain regions was discussed.
He told the Mudaliyar brothers, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliyar and Arcot Laxmanaswamy Mudaliyar that they should take the people of Travancore to travel there and hoist the tricolor there and the first tricolor should be hoisted in Lakshadweep.
Immediately after his order, the tricolor was blown up and the neighbouring country of Lakshadweep was destroyed by looking at the neighbourhood.
After this incident, Sardar Patel said that Lakshadweep will get every necessary assistance for development, he added.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing to Indias progress.
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I hope that we will visit these beautiful islands and sea shores.
My dear countrymen, the statue of unity built in the memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the nation and the world on 31st October, 2018.
This is the highest statue in the world.
The statue of freedom of the United States is twice the height.
The highest statue in the world fills every Indian with pride.
Every Indian's dignity was a pride.
You will be happy to note that in a year more than 26 lakh tourists went there to see the statue of unity.
This means that everyday at least eight and a half thousand people see the magnificence of the statue of unity.
He expressed his faith in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and now there are several centres of attraction for select gardens, cattle parks, jungle safaris, nutritional food parks and unity nursery.
Considering the convenience of the tourists coming, the people of many villages are providing such facilities in their homes and homes.
Professional training is also being provided to those who provide home-state facilities at home.
I am confident that the people of the region have now started the farming of dragon fruits and will soon be the main source of livelihood of the people there.
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, a statue of unity can be a subject of study.
We are all witnesses to the development of one place as a world famous tourist destination in a year.
People from all over the country and abroad come there.
Several arrangements like transportation, stopping, guidance and environmental supplementary arrangements have been developing on one hand.
There is a huge economic activity and people are creating facilities as per the requirements of the passengers.
The government is playing its role.
Friends, The Time Month last month has placed a statue of unity among the 100 important tourist destinations in the world.
I hope that all of you will take some time out of our precious times and see the statue of unity.
But I urge every Indian who takes time to travel with the families of India to travel at least 15 tourist destinations, to stay wherever he goes.
Friends, As you know, every year 31st October is celebrated as National Integration Day since 2014.
This day gives us a message to protect the unity, integrity and security of our country by giving us any price.
On 31st October, every year, Run for Unity- Unity Run is being organized.
This will include people from every section of the society, every section of the society.
Run for Unity is a symbol of the fact that this country is one, walking in one direction and achieving a goal.
However, nowadays, there is a version of marathon in the people.
Run for Unity is also a similar provision.
We have to run here, we have been connected with the objectives of Fit India and Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat.
And that is why not only the body but also the mind and culture have to run to take India to new heights for the unity of India.
For this, you can get information about the run for unit around the city where you live.
In this portal, the place where run for units will be organised across the country has been informed.
All of you will run on 31st October - for the unity of India and for your health.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel has built the country in the threshold of unity.
This mantra of unity is like a Sanskar in our lives and we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every level, at every stage, at every stage, at every stage, at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to empower the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court had given its results on the birth anniversary of Ram.
Just remember that day, what kind of atmosphere was there.
How many people had come to the ground.
How interested groups were playing sports to take advantage of the situation.
What kind of language used to be used to cater to the environment.
Efforts were also made to fill smoothness in different voices .
On the one hand, everything was going on to create an atmosphere for two weeks but when the results came to Ram Janmabhoomi then the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all communities, saints and saints gave a very restraint response.
Efforts to reduce stress in the environment .
But even today I remember that day.
These things should always be kept in mind and they give us a lot of strength.
This is the example of how much strength the sun of unity gives to the country.
My dear countrymen, the death of our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 31st October was the same day.
Today I also pay homage to the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, today some stories are being heard in the household at a distance, one story of every village is heard from the north to the south, from the east to the west, every corner of India is the story of cleanliness.
Every individual, every family and every village want to share their joyous experiences about cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is an effort of 125 crore Indians.
Their results are also 125 crore Indians.
But there is also a pleasant and entertaining experience .
I heard, I thought, let me tell you that too.
You can imagine that the world's highest battlefield where the temperature falls from zero to 50 degrees to 60 degrees.
In the air the air is called the air .
In such a difficult situation, it is not even less than the valour of such challenges.
In such a situation, our brave soldiers are not only conserving the borders of the country, but they are running a clean Siachen campaign there.
I compliment the countrymen for this unique commitment of the Indian Army.
I express my gratitude.
There is so much cold that it is difficult to have some disintegration.
In such a situation, dissolution and management of waste is an important task.
In such a situation, 130 tonnes and more waste from the glaciers and surrounding areas and how big is this service in such a delicate environment.
We all know that Siachen is such a part that is the source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, the purpose of running the Swachhta Abhiyan here is to ensure clean water for those living in the following areas and also use water of rivers like Nubra and Shauk.
My dear countrymen, Festivals are a festival awakening a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Diwali, especially in every family, some or the other things are being bought from the market.
The more we try to buy local goods, the more the Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity.
And I urge you to buy the hands of our weavers and the hands of our khadiwala.
You must have bought a lot before Diwali too.
However, there would be many people who would be thinking that if they went after Diwali, they would get a little cheaper.
There will be many people whose shopping is still there.
I would like to urge you to buy local goods and buy local goods only while wishing Diwali.
See how important the dream of Mahatma Gandhi can play.
But sometimes there is a fire because of being unconscious.
Somewhere there is wound .
I urge all of you to take care of yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Every Indian, whether it belongs to any region, caste, religion, creed or language, is always ready to express his joy and support towards our soldiers.
Yesterday, 125 crore Indians celebrated Parakram Parv.
We recalled the target-breaking attacks in 2016, when our soldiers responded to the hiding war against terrorism.
Our armed forces and exhibitions have been performed in different parts of the country so that more and more citizens of the country, especially the younger generation can understand their strength.
We can know how much we are capable and how our soldiers protect our countrymen by putting their lives.
The day like Parakram Parv reminds the youth of the glorious heritage of our armed forces and inspires us to maintain the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
It is sure that our soldiers will give a befitting answer to those who try to destroy the atmosphere of peace and progress of our country.
We have faith in peace and we are committed to encourage it, but we have never lost the value of dignity and the universality of the country.
India has always been committed and dedicated to peace.
This was a valour by our soldiers towards peace.
Even today, the pace of the United Nations is one of the countries that send maximum soldiers to different peacekeeping forces.
For decades, our soldiers have played an important role in putting blue helmets in the world for peace.
My dear countrymen, the story of the sky is different.
One of the best people in the Republic Day programme is the fly past in which our Air Forces select their capabilities by conducting cheetah thrilling air tests.
We celebrate Air Force Day on 8th October.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the air force personnel and their families who have served the country.
In 1947, when the Pakistani attacker launched an indirect attack, the Air Force ensured that Indian soldiers and materials will reach the battlefield to defend Srinagar.
The Air Force also responded to the enemy in 1965.
Who doesn't know the freedom fighter of Bangladesh in 1971
The Air Force has also played an important role in liberating Kargil from Dhuskhora in 1999.
On the Tiger Hill, the air force dusted them in the shelters of the enemies at night.
Be it relief and rescue work or disaster management, the country is grateful for the commendable achievements of these brave soldiers of our Air Force.
Their work is unprecedented to combat natural calamities and help the countrymen from the floods to the fire in the forest.
The Air Force has also made ideals to ensure women equality in the country and the doors of each of our departments have been opened for the girls.
Now the Air Force is giving an alternative to the Permanent Commission along with the Short Service Commission, which I had announced on 15th August this year from the Red Fort.
India can proudly say that in our armed forces, men and women are contributing to the same strength.
Women are strong and now armed.
My dear countrymen, in the last few days, one officer of the Navy, Abhilash Tommy, was blaming for life and death.
The whole country was worried about how to save them.
You all know that Abhilash Tommy is a brave officer.
He is the first Indian officer to take a small name from any modern technologies to the world.
For the last 80 days, he was moving towards the sea to take part in the South Indian Ocean and the Golden Global Race, but the terrible maritime storm created a crisis in front of them but the brave Indian Navy continued to fight for several days in the sea.
I pray for the best health of Abhilash Tommy and this courage, their valour, their determination and the strength to win will definitely inspire the younger generation of our country.
My dear countrymen, the children are also aware of the importance of the day of 2nd October for our country.
There is another special significance on 2nd October this year.
Two years from now on, we will have several programmes around the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The ideas of Mahatma Gandhi inspired the entire world.
Whether it is Dr. Martin Luther King Junior or Nelson Mandela, the great personality, everybody has gained strength from Gandhi's ideas and has been able to fight for equality and dignity to our people.
From today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to discuss another important work of my revered Bapu, which most of the people should know.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a constructive programme.
After that, when the freedom struggle in 1945 insisted, he prepared a reflection of these ideas.
Revered Bapu, farmers, villages, protecting the rights of labourers, sanitation, spread of education etc.
It is also called Gandhi Charter.
Revered Bapu was a folk collection.
It was the nature of Bapu that connecting people and mixing them.
Everyone had ever experienced this very specialty.
He made everybody feel that the person is the most important and most important for the country.
The biggest contribution of the freedom struggle is that they have made this struggle a mass movement.
Reflecting the call of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle, the people of every region, every section of the society bowed themselves.
Bapu had given you an inspirational mantra.
Is it possible that he can overcome his life and fate
Is it possible that millions of people will get self-confidence, those who are hungry and their souls are unsatisfied
Then you will find that your doubts have started decreasing and the ego has started ending.
My dear countrymen, a mantra of Gandhiji is equally important even today.
Today, the middle class is growing in the country, their growing economic strength, the growing purchasing power, and one moment we can remember Bapu.
Who is fortunate, whose purchase will benefit directly or indirectly.
If the poorest of the poor benefits then I will be more happy.
Keeping this mantra of Gandhiji in mind, while celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji in the coming days, you must certainly note that the interest of building a nation should be achieved due to your shopping and in the same way those who have used their sweat, their money and their talent should be benefitted in what way.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I believe that this small step can make a big change in the lives of the poorest and the weakest person.
But this was achieved, India got freedom.
Similarly, today we can feel that this small work can also contribute to my country's economic progress, economic empowerment and strengthening the poor against poverty.
This is the true patriotism in today's era.
He said that all these khadi clothes have been manufactured very hard and every drain should be used.
The spirit of self-confidence towards the country and the spirit of affection towards the countrymen was reflected in the destruction of this great personality of this childhood.
In two days, along with the birth anniversary of Puja Bapu, we will also celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji.
As soon as the name of Shastri ji is high, the feeling of unlimited reverence in the minds of our Indians is blooming.
His brilliant personality is always proud of every countrymen.
The specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri was that he was very humble from outside but he was determined like a mountain.
Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, his announcement is the identity of his brave personality.
It was the result of his uninterrupted penance towards the nation that in a short span of about one and a half years, he gave a mantra to the soldiers and farmers of the country to reach the peaks of success.
My dear countrymen, it is natural that if we remember Bapu, we will not be able to talk about cleanliness.
The Swachhta Hi Seva campaign was launched from 15th September.
Millions of people participated in this event and I was fortunate to have labour with the students of Ambedkar School in Delhi.
I went to the school whose foundation stone was laid by Baba Saheb himself.
The workforce was attended by people from all levels across the country on 15th.
The institution also participated in this event.
School students, college students, NCCs, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Private Industries have made a large number of Swachhta Shramdaans.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these sanitation lovers.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has become a successful story not only in the country but in the whole world.
India is organizing the largest global sanitation convention in history, Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Cleanliness Ministers and experts from all over the world together share their experiments and experiences on cleanliness.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will conclude with the commencement of the 150th Birth Anniversary celebrations of Bapu on 2nd October 2018.
My dear countrymen, there is a saying in Sanskrit that justice is at the root of Swaraj, when justice is discussed, the feeling of human rights is inclusive.
It is particularly important to ensure freedom, peace and justice for the exploited, deprived.
In the Constitution given by Babasaheb Ambedkar, provisions have been made to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on 12th October, 1993.
In a few days, NHRC will complete 25 years.
NHRC has worked to promote human dignity along with protecting human rights.
Our beloved leader, the former Prime Minister of the country, Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clarified that human rights is not a perfect concept for us.
In the symbolic symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, all the Bhavntu Sukhins of the Vedic period have been engraved.
NHRC has created a comprehensive awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing misuse of them.
During this 25-year visit, the Commission has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the countrymen.
I believe that this is an optimistic thing for a healthy society and for better democratic values.
Today, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been set up at the national level.
This is the basis of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas'. It is the need to know and conduct the importance of human rights as a society.
This year too, before your efforts, organise a run for unity in your villages, towns and towns.
The race for unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for unity throughout his life.
I appeal to all of you that on 31st October, every section of the society, every section of the country, through the run for unity, this will be the best tribute to them.
My dear countrymen, I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all of you for the sacred festivals of Navratri, Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today, the whole country is celebrating Rakhi Purnima.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this holy day.
Rakshabandhan is celebrated as a symbol of love and belief among brothers and sisters.
Now Janmashtami will be celebrated soon.
All of them will enhance the glimpse of Hathi, Horse, Palki-Jai Kanhail ki, Govinda-Govinda.
The joy of being colored in the color of Lord Krishna is very different .
Sir, Advanced Sanskrit-Dinamasti.
Sanskrit languages, Sarla and Sarva Vadanti.
Brothers and sisters, along with Rakshabandhan, the day of Shravan Purnima is also celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
At the same time, we are also proud of the fact that from Vedas to present, the Sanskrit language has played an important role in the propagation of knowledge.
In the Sanskrit language and literature of this language, knowledge is like a portion of every field of life.
Moreover, however, the challenge of today's global problem was to be addressed, the mantras of answering these issues are also mentioned in the Sanskrit language.
You all will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village in Shivmoga district of Karnataka still use Sanskrit language to speak.
We will be surprised to know that a special feature of Sanskrit language is the creation of new words in this language.
What is the importance of Guru Namek in life , it has been said in the language to clarify that although Akshramastu , Guru : Scientists , Prabodhyet .
My dear countrymen, Monsoon rain brings a new hope for our farmers who work hard.
This rain is a boon for sandy, dried trees and plants due to heavy heat.
However, in a few times, it brings overwhelming, devastating, devastating Mahapur.
Rainfall has occurred at some places in the country.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural calamity should improve their health at the earliest.
However, in such a situation, humanity has been seen.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everybody can do whatever possible, whether it is in Kerala or in any other district of India.
He made tireless efforts to save the lives of the people stuck in the flood.
Whether it is the Air Force, the Navy, the Army personnel, the Border Security Force, the CISF, the RAF and the Army have played an important role in rescue and assistance.
In this sacred period of Onam, we pray that the country, especially Kerala, has the power to get out of this crisis as soon as possible, and the development journey of Kerala will get a better momentum.
Once again, on behalf of all the countrymen, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and the places where there has been such heavy rains across the country that the entire country is with you in such a situation.
For the last ten years, he had gone far from active politics.
But after 16th August, the country and the world saw that the common man in India had immense affection for Atal ji even after these ten years.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change has led to two significant changes in India's politics.
First of all, the size of the Cabinet of the States was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats.
Secondly, the limit fixed under the anti-party law was one-third, it was increased to two-thirds.
Clear guidelines have also been made to ensure that the members who have been transformed into the pair of the pair.
Atal ji was a loyal patriot.
During his tenure, the time for the budget of the country was changed in the House of Parliament.
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of budgeting in Parliament to 11 in the morning.
Some of the rules of the Code have made it possible to hoist the Tricolor at public places.
More and more Indians got the opportunity to flag off their national flag.
Atal ji has done a great job to bring our beloved tricolor to the people.
People are making their views as a opponent in this regard.
I pay homage to Atal ji on all of you by reiterating his resolve to fulfil the dream of a prosperous and developed India.
You will certainly be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and that of the Rajya Sabha was 74.
The Act will protect the interests of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh had just heard five days and punished the culprits.
In Rajasthan too, in the courts there, such decisions have been taken immediately on the cracks of atrocities against women.
The Act will play an effective role in preventing crimes against women and girls.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
In this monsoon session of the Parliament, all the members have put an ideal article together.
For this, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country on the public level.
My dear countrymen, the attention of crores of Indians is now on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
The Asian sports competition is still going on.
I would like to congratulate all the sportspersons who won medals for the country.
The number of medal winners for the country has increased, especially our daughters are involved in it, this gives a very positive signal.
Keep in mind your healthcare as a healthy, healthy country can build a rich and prosperous India.
Namaste Bhavva ji, I respect your feelings.
Everybody is surprised to see the queen's pool built in Patna in Gujarat in the 21st century.
The land of India is like an engineering laboratory.
Several engineers in India have been able to think only.
We have got a jewellery of our traditions that share the legacy of great engineers.
This gem is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
Vishwaswaraiya.
The Krishnaraj Sagar Dam built on the Kaveri river is still benefiting millions of farmers and the people.
In Kutch it is called Bhunga.
My houses have seen 3-3 earthquakes.
I have myself experienced three earthquakes in this house.
But if you go inside, you don't see any harm.
This house has been built by our ancestors in accordance with the nature of this place, the geographical structure and the environment here.
After seeing the house, I thought that even before several ages, the engineers of that period had thought of the local situation and how they had constructed a house in accordance with it, so that the people could be safe.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers Day, we must also consider the future.
Workshops should be taken at places.
Should we learn new things in the changing times
Which things should be taught to the people
How to connect .
Today, disaster management has been a big task.
The entire world has to face natural calamities.
In such a situation, how can a new form of structural engineering be
How will it have different courses
What should the student be taught in this
Many such things should be considered at the time when Engineers Day is celebrated.
My dear countrymen, there is an atmosphere of celebrations.
At the same time, preparations for Diwali will start.
We will continue to meet Mann Ki Baat and will continue to talk about Mann Ki Baat.
At the same time, we will be working to take our country forward from our hearts.
With this spirit, my best wishes to you all.
The citizens of some parts are still waiting for Varunraj.
India is vast and it has diversity, but Varunraj is sometimes showing the form of his favourite favour in this country.
In such a situation, the most important responsibility is that we all should be the protector of nature, the protector of nature.
If we become natural, then the balance of nature will be achieved by ourselves.
You must have seen this incident on television.
Actually it takes about a few hours to go and return to that cave .
After coming out, these children resorted to a little height in the cave.
But they had to stay within 18 days or not for one or two days.
Now we can imagine how their moments and moments will have gone in a mental state when there is direct death in front of us.
On the one hand, these children were jeopardizing with the crisis and on the other hand humanity in the world was united and manifesting the human qualities of God.
Specially, after seeing everybody's very restraint, I feel that this is a learning and understanding qualities.
Those whose children were stuck inside, their parents were not suffering or the mother was not suffering from tears.
But with patience and restraint, the peaceful behavior of the entire society is very important and it is a matter of learning.
A Thailand Navy personnel lost their lives in the entire campaign of this assistance.
The entire world saw that the bravery of patience and valour to help those who were stuck in the cave in a very difficult situation filled with water and darkness.
This incident showed that when humanity was united, such miracles take place.
However, it is necessary to focus only on the work of peaceful and stable minds and for which we are working.
A few days ago, the beloved poet Neeraj ji left us forever.
Neeraj ji had a special feature.
He had a lot of faith in himself along with hope, faith and determination.
Everything of Neeraj ji can be very inspiring and powerful to all the Indians.
As such, the months of July and August are very important for the farmers brothers and all the youngsters.
Because during this period there is a problem of admission of colleges.
Millions of youngsters like Satyam are coming out of school life and entering colleges.
When the youth are moving on a new path in life, then our focus comes away from the question and comes upon the cut-off.
The attention of the students is now from the house to the habitation.
Students come out of the shadow of their parents and come under the umbrella of their professors.
I am sure that my young friends will be very enthusiastic about the beginning of the college life.
For the first time, we used to leave the house and leave the village and go to the other side and get out of a safe environment and have to be ourselves.
For the first time, many youngsters have left their homes to give a different direction to their lives.
I would like to tell you all that you should be calm and enjoy this life.
It is necessary to study but while learning the natural eagerness of finding new things should remain in you.
Old friends have a special value.
I see the news of how a student named Asharam Chaudhari had achieved academic achievements in the lives of a poor family in Madhya Pradesh.
The entrance examination of MBBS for ASHARAM Jodhpur has been completed in the first attempt.
Anushka Panda, the Divyang girl of Gurgaon, is afflicted with a genetic disease of Spanish Muscular Atrophy as soon as she was born.
All of them have worked to keep watching the entire world by confronting all the problems faced by their determination and strife.
If we look close to us then we will see many such examples.
Any good event in any part of the country, it gives me energy.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, my eyes fell on a news and wrote in it: Two youths have fulfilled the dream of Modi.
On reading the news, we realized how our youth use technologies in smart and creativity and how they try to change the lives of the common man.
The incident was that San Jose city of America was considered the centre of technology and once I was talking to the Indian youth there.
At that time, I urge them to think about how you can use your intelligence and skills for your India and take a short while and do something new.
I used to urge Brain-Drain to answer the problem of Brain-Drain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji accepted my call and brought an innovative composition.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together have prepared a Smartgaon App using their professional skills.
This app not only connects the people of the villages to the entire world but also provides any information and information through this app on your mobile.
Residents of Taudhakpur village in Rae Bareli, Gram Heads Sarpanch, District Magistrates and Chief District Officers have created awareness among the people to use this app.
In fact, this is a unique journey of Pandharpur.
Friends, This year Ashadhi Ekadshi was held on 23rd July, on this day, the festival of Vari is celebrated with great devotion on Pandharpur.
Pandharpur is a sacred city in Solapur district of Maharashtra.
In the footsteps of great saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram, he used to come out on foot towards Pandharpur while singing the name of Vithal.
Vithal, which is also called Vithoba or Pandurang, the pilgrims reach Pandharpur for their philosophy.
Vithal is a deity to protect the interests of the poor, the deprived and the vulnerable.
In the minds of the people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, there is immense devotion to Panduranga.
Go to Vithoba temple in Pandharpur and describe the glory and beauty there.
The literature of these saints has given an important message of goodwill, love and brotherhood.
These saints gave the mantra of strengthening the society to fight against darkness.
And he also encouraged the old evils to eradicate themselves from the society and reflected the essence of compassion, equality and purity on the minds of the people.
Lokmanya Tilak is a sea of adventure and self-confidence.
The British made an unprecedented effort to prove the sedition by running the sedition thrice in 20 years.
This is not a simple thing.
Today, I would like to tell the people of Lokmanya Tilak and his statues in Ahmedabad.
At that time, more than 40 thousand people were present in Ahmedabad to welcome him and during his visit, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had the opportunity to interact with Tilak.
During this visit, the personality of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel and Lokmanya Tilak was very impressed by thoughts.
Lokmanya Tilak died on 1st August, 1920, after that, Patel decided to build Tilak's memorial in Ahmedabad.
Finally, the statue of Tilak was built and Sardar Saheb inaugurated the memorial by Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 1929.
My dear countrymen, this statue is also very rare, Lokmanya Tilak is sitting on a chair and along with Tilak, he has written 'Swaraj Hamara Janmasiddha Hai' along the bottom.
With the traditional devotion and devotion of the public Ganesh festival, it became an effective medium to create a sense of social awareness, collective work, equality and equality among the people.
If we see it then in that specific period there was a need to fight against the British together.
And because of the festivals started by Tilaks, they worked to unite everyone by breaking the walls of the castes and communities.
The popularity of these festivals has increased in Ogha of time and it is also reflected that today's younger generation has a lot of attraction for the brave heroes in our ancient traditions and history.
Today in many cities there is a pavilion of Ganesh festivals in almost every streets .
All the families of the streets together organise the Ganapati festival .
Here too, our youth get a good opportunity, their leadership, festival organizers, programme organizers and coordinators can develop their qualities.
From the idol of Ganesh to the luggage of decoration, all should be environment friendly.
Today, every Indian needs good governance and development results.
I talk about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Azad spent his life, but he never bowed down to foreign rule.
Chandrashekhar Azad's village is Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh and I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit this village.
I had got the opportunity to pay homage to the Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad and I had promised that Chandrashekhar Azad had not wished to die with the bullets of the foreigners but he would continue to fight for freedom till the end but he would sacrifice only after independence.
This was their specialty.
Once again I bow down to these two great sons of Mother India - Lokmanya Tilak Ji and Chandrashekhar Azad Ji.
A few days ago, Indias brave daughter and daughter Hima Das, a son, won a gold medal in the 400-meter race in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics winnership event in Finland.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, has sent me an e-mail from Indonesia in response to my letter and now unity is preparing for the Asian Games.
In our e-mail, unity has written that the most important moment in the lives of an athlete is that moment when a player holds a tricolor in his hand.
You all are proud of unity.
We are proud of you for brightening the name of our country.
World Para Athletics Grand Pricks 2018 won Unity Gold and Bronze medals in Tunisia.
We should move forward, keep sporting and developing.
My dear countrymen, several historical events have taken place in the month of August and several festivals also take place in the month of August but during the rainy season, sickness is also entering the house for some time.
Once again, I will definitely meet Mann Ki Baat.
Thank you very much
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, today I have got the privilege of interacting with you through Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago, there was a historic face of cricket in Bangalore.
You must have remembered that I will talk about the cricket criteria between India and Afghanistan.
During this event, the two teams showcased very good sports.
Rashid Khan, a Golden Guard of Afghanistan, had done a very good job in IPL this year.
I thank your Indian friends for providing a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their skills.
Whatever is the best and best in Afghanistan, it represents the same.
We have experienced the sportspersons and sportspersons.
Sports is a very good medium to unite society and showcase the skills and talent of our youth.
My best wishes to both India and Afghanistan.
I hope that we will continue to play with each other and develop in the same way.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June this fourth Yoga Day was a different vision.
Whether it is the European Parliament, the United Nations Headquarters of New York or the Japanese Navy Fighting Vessel, people were seen doing Yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic event on Yoga and I got to know that women have done guidance for several asanas.
In Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China jointly practiced Yoga on the high-altitude snow peaks.
It is working to connect everyone by breaking the bonds of the borders.
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries have celebrated Yoga Day by crossing different kinds of caste, religion, region, color or sex.
If people from all over the world had participated in the programmes of Yoga Day, then why wouldn't the cakets be enthusiastic in India
Yoga has been practiced at all three places of our country's security forces, ships, naval and air force.
Some brave soldiers performed Yoga on the window.
Some soldiers practiced yoga on the snowy mountains of Siachen.
The warriors of our Air Force were surprised by Yoga in the sky at a height of 15,000 feet from the ground.
It is to be mentioned that they have not practiced Yoga in the air, but have practiced Yoga in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or sports grounds, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
Yoga has done the work of crossing the caste, creed and geographical boundaries and uniting people from all over the world and we have been living with the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam since ancient times.
Our sages, Muni and Saints have always emphasized this idea.
Today, Yoga has proved it properly and has been shown by the means.
Today, the idea of Wellness is working as a revolution.
We see the mother as a goddess, mother gives birth to us, so we consider her as a goddess, this is our culture.
Sometimes the doctor gives us reborn.
The role of doctors is not limited to medication.
The doctors do not have medical knowledge but they also have a good experience of how their lifestyles should be, the impact of which style is now increasing and what is affecting our health.
Indian doctors have demonstrated their immense capabilities and skills and have created their unique and independent identity all over the world.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I convey my best wishes to all our doctors co-operatives on the next 1st of July on the occasion of Doctors Day.
India has a rich history.
The Kabirwad of Gujarat will be a good destination for you and whenever I was working in Gujarat, a large national session was held by the people of Saint Kabir's tradition.
Everyone knows that Saint Kabirdas, a village of Maghar in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh, had taken the samadhi.
But Kabirdas ji had chosen the same place for the samadhi.
At that time it was believed that those who died in Magahar did not get a place in heaven.
And the one who sacrifices in Kashi goes into heaven.
Maghar was considered an unforgettable place but Saint Kabirdas had no faith in such things.
Saint Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through Sakhiya and Doha.
This was his ideal.
This is the ideal of their creations.
This means that the one who understands the pain of the other is the true fakir, the saint.
And whoever does not know the sorrow of others, they are indifferent.
Kabirdas ji had given special emphasis on social harmony.
He was thinking ahead of time.
The knowledge of the people should be considered as the basis and respect them.
Though the time has been lost today, Kabir's words are as effective as possible.
Today, when we read the things of Kabir ji, we feel that these things are telling us of today's knowledge age.
We feel that their thoughts are relevant even today.
Now, when we talk about Saint Kabirdas Ji, I remember one of his two words in which he says, "Guru Govind Dou Padha, Kake can be implemented.
Such a great Guru is Jagatguru-Guru Nanakdev.
He showed glory to millions of people and has been inspiring for generations.
Guru Nanakdev used to say that the service of the poor and the needy is like serving God.
Wherever he went, he worked for the welfare of the society.
He brought up the system of social distinction free kitchen and the people of any caste, religion and community could eat and eat food and Guru Nanakdev started the process of 'Langar'.
In 2019, Guru Nanak Dev ji will celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv.
The terrible incident in Jallianwala Bagh will complete 100 years in 2019, which was about to blacken the entire humanity.
Peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice always wins.
Shyamaprasad Mukherjee's birth anniversary and I am in this programme today.
During the period 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had contributed a lot.
He was very enthusiastic and dedicated to the development of West Bengal.
Let's go, let's all of us, Dr.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various government schemes through video calls.
He said that by crossing the files, they have got the opportunity to know about the changes in the lives of people.
In the remote villages, the youngsters are providing services through Common Service Centre, from pension to passports for the elderly in the villages.
In Chhattisgarh, a sister used to collect a sitaphal and make it an ice-cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of young people of the country have been running Jan Aushadhi Kendras and providing medicines at affordable rates by going to nearby villages.
I am happy to note that the success of the common man is more than the success of the government in this entire programme. The success of the common man is the true power of this country.
In such a disappointing environment, it will not be credited to the government when he gives us information about the hopes, new enthusiasm and events that are happening in our lives.
The incident of a young girl in a small village in the remote areas is also inspiring to inspire 125 crore Indians.
With the help of technology, through video bridge, a moment spent with the beneficiaries has also been very pleasant and inspiring.
The poorest of the poor gets a new joy, new zeal and inspiration in another way.
I am very grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people participated in the video bridge programme and they worked to give me new strength.
I once again express my gratitude to all for this.
On the one hand there are professionals and technicians and on the other hand our farmers working in the field are brothers and sisters.
Now we will also think that agriculture and technology are both different businesses and what are they related to
Their successful efforts were being made to enhance the income of the farmers.
On the one hand, a chain has been created from crop production to its marketing, the role of farmers in it is important and on the other hand, it is an attempt to ensure the participation of the farmers in the profits.
Friends
This work we have done in youth is indeed inspiring the youth.
One Nation, One Tax was the dream of the people of the country.
If you want to give maximum credit to reforming One Nation, One Tax, then I will give it to the states.
GST cooperative federalism is a very good example in which all the states together decided for the benefit of the country and thereafter, thereafter, tax reforms have been possible in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and people with different political ideas come together in this meeting.
Prior to GST, there were 17 different types of tax systems in the country but now the new system has implemented a single tax system in the entire country.
GST is a victory of authenticity and it is also a festival of honesty.
Earlier, many times there were complaints about 'Inspectorraj' in tax cases.
GST is perhaps the worlds largest tax reform.
Normally, during such a huge population, a period of 5-7 years could have been implemented to improve and stabilize the entire scheme.
Namaskar recently held the 21st Commonwealth Games in Australia from 4th April to 15th April.
And when there is an atmosphere like this, there is a resolution to show zeal, excitement, zeal, hope, aspiration and something.
This was a time when people from all over the country used to think that who is going to play today.
How many medals we won, how much India's achievements will be, and all these were very natural.
Our sportspersons also performed well by fulfilling the expectations of the countrymen and won one medal after one.
Whether it is naming, wrestling, loading, table tennis or badminton, India has done the best.
26 Gold, 20 Silver, 20 Bronze: India has earned 66 medals.
Every Indian is proud of this success.
Winning medals is a matter of pride and happiness for every sportsperson.
This is a moment of pride for all the nations and for all the countrymen.
Perhaps my words will be reduced to expressing that feeling.
But I would like to listen to you what I have heard from these players.
This is the reason why there were many things that happened for the first time.
Manika Batra won medals in all the competitions he participated.
She is the first Indian women sportsperson who won India the first Gold in the individual table tennis competition.
India won the highest medal.
The 15-year-old Indian teamman Anish Bhavar became the youngest sportsperson who won the Gold in the Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary, who won medals in the Commonwealth Games, is the only Indian Para Power Lifter.
The sports competition was also special because most of the medal winners were women sportspersons.
Whether it is squash, boxing, weightlifting or naming, women sportspersons performed excellent performance.
Everyone was eager to fight, both the medals were received by India.
The sportspersons who participated in the competition came from different parts of the country and from small towns.
His friends have also contributed to those who have raised their patience in every situation.
Last month, in Mann Ki Baat, I had called upon the countrymen, especially our youth, to Fit India and I had invited everyone.
Participate in Fit India, represent Fit India.
And I am very happy that people are participating in it with great enthusiasm.
Many people have written letters and have shown their support, have sent letters, have shared their health mantra on social media - Fit India story.
A householder Shashikant Bhosle has written sharing his pictures in the Jalpan Talab: My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath has written: I feel happy and healthy because of the morning walk.
And they further say - for me-fitness companies with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy.
There is no doubt that Devnathji is healthy in happiness.
While sharing his picture of mountaineering, Shri Dhawal Prajapati wrote: Travel and mountaineering for me is Fit India.
I am very happy to see that many famous people are encouraging their youth in a very attractive way for Fit India.
Film actor Akshay Kumar has shared a video on Twitter.
Many more youngsters have shared their experiences in Fit India.
I believe that such movements are very beneficial for all of us and for the entire country.
One more thing I will definitely say - the name of the Fit India Movement is Yoga without spending any money.
The importance of International Day of Yoga on 21st June is now accepted by the entire world.
You will also be preparing from now on.
Not alone, your city, your villages, your departments, your schools, your colleges should try to participate in Yoga, be it men and women of any age.
Today I want to talk to you to invite you for a new job and I have seen that many youngsters are learning something new at this time.
My young friends, I urge you to join a special internship.
Three Ministries of the Government of India, be it Sports, Human Resource Development, Department of Drinking Water, three-four Ministries of the Government have jointly launched Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018.
The students and students of the college, the youth of NCC, the youth of the NSS, the youth of Nehru Yuva Kendra, whoever wants to do whatever they want to do, whoever wants to participate in making changes in the society
There is an opportunity for all of them to do something with a positive energy and it will also strengthen cleanliness and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi from 2nd October, we will be happy to do something before it and I also tell you that those who are the best trainees who have done good work in colleges and universities will be awarded national awards.
Not only this, the UGC will also give two credit points to the trainees who complete this.
I once again invite the students, students and the youth to take advantage of this internship.
You can register on MyGov for Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope that our youth will certainly succeed in this movement of cleanliness.
Let us use these holidays as an opportunity to experience a new experience.
This group of youngsters has started a big campaign for education of children living on the roads and slums.
Initially, the conditions of children who have been asking for begging or doing small work on the road left them so much that they bowed themselves completely in this work.
The drive that started from 15 children in the slums near Gita Colony in Delhi has now reached 2,000 children in 12 locations in the capital.
Youth and teachers associated with this campaign have been involved in this Bhagirath effort to bring about social change by taking two hours from their busy daily life.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers from the hilly areas of Uttarakhand have been an inspiration for the farmers across the country.
With collective efforts, he has not only changed the fate of his own but also of his field.
In Bageshwar of Uttarakhand mainly the crops of Mandwa , corn or barley are taken .
He started making biscuits from this crop in the field and started selling biscuits.
These farmers have set up a cooperative institution in Munnar village and have opened a factory to produce biscuits.
With the patience of the farmers, the administration has also linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being distributed to Almora and Kausani not only in about 50 Anganwadi centers of Bageshwar district .
With the hard work of the farmers, the institution's annual turnover has not only reached Rs. 10 to 15 lakhs but it has also reduced the migration from the district due to employment opportunities for more than 900 families.
My dear countrymen, when we hear that in the future there will be war for water in the world.
Everyone speaks this thing but is there no responsibility for us
Do you not think water conservation should be a social responsibility
Every person should be responsible.
For centuries, our ancestors have shown this.
He has given priority to every drop of water.
They have discovered new solutions to save every drop of water.
Those of you who have got the opportunity to visit Tamil Nadu may have seen that in some temples of Tamil Nadu, large inscriptions have been written in the temples regarding irrigation system, water conservation system and drought management.
Be it Manarkovil, Chiran Mahadevi, Kovilpatti or Pudukottai, you will see big inscriptions everywhere.
Even today, various tourist destinations are popular but we do not forget that these live proofs of the water conservation campaign of our ancestors are also there.
UNESCO is a global heritage and its grandeur is worth seeing in Gujarat.
Vihiri is a Jal Mandir in a way .
If you go to Rajasthan then you must visit Chand Vihar in Jodhpur.
This is the largest and well-known wheel in India and the most important thing is that there is a deficiency of water in the region.
It is the period of April, May, June and July, when there is a good opportunity to store rain water and if we prepare it before then we will get much benefit.
Manrega's funds are also used for water conservation.
In the last three years, each has made its own efforts towards water reservoirs and water management.
In addition to MNREGA funds every year, an average of Rs. 32,000 crore has been spent on water reservoir and water management.
In 2017-18, out of the total expenditure of Rs. 64,000 crore, 55 of the total expenditure has been spent on water reservoirs of about Rs. 35,000 crore.
In the last three years, about 150 lakh hectares of land have been benefitted by such water reservoirs and water reservoirs.
The district administration under Manrega has taken up the responsibility of land and water conservation.
With the help of people from about 40 to 45 villages, the dry rivers of Sasur Khadri have been revived.
Whether it is animals, birds, farmers, agriculture, villages, this is a big success.
I would say that once again, April, May, June and July are in front of you, we should also take some responsibility for water conservation, we should also formulate some schemes, we will also do something.
When Mann Ki Baat is held then all around the message comes to me, letters come and phones come.
Ion Kumar Banerjee of Devitola village in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal has written on MyGov that we celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many do not know the philosophy of living a peaceful, beautiful and honest life of Nobel winner Rabindranath Tagore.
Please discuss this topic in the Mann Ki Baat programme that people will be aware of it.
I express my gratitude to Ionji that he attracted the attention of all the companions of Mann Ki Baat.
Gurudev Tagore was an individual with wisdom and wisdom, whose writings have made a mark on everyone.
Rabindranath was a talented, multi-dimensional person, but he was a teacher every moment.
I had a habit of listening to Rabindra Music on the radio early in the morning and when there was an opportunity to listen to the poems of Anandloke and Aguner, Poroshmani.
You must have been impressed by Rabindra Music and his poems.
I pay homage to Rabindranath Thakur.
In a few days, the holy month of Ramadan will start.
Ramzan month is celebrated throughout the world with full respect and respect.
The collective objective of daily routine is that when a person is himself hungry then he also feels the hunger of others.
When he feels thirsty himself, he feels thirsty to others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings and messages of the Prophet Mohammad.
It is our responsibility to follow the path of equality and brotherhood like them.
Once one person asked the messengers, what is the best thing in Islam
The Prophet Saheb said, Whether you know them or not to give food to the poor and the needy and to think of everyone in your own way.
Peshit Mohammad believed in knowledge and compassion.
They had no arrogance of anything.
He used to say that ego only defeats knowledge.
Peshit Mohammad was convinced that a person is not because of this property but because of his sacred soul.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should feel proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha that shows the power to serve and sacrifice, which guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha reminds Lord Purnima of the responsibility of following the path shown by Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality, peace, unity and brotherhood.
These are human values which are the most needed in today's world.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar used to say that Lord Buddha has a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Babasaheb empowered millions of people be it the Dalits, the victims, the exploited, the deprived.
It cannot be a bigger example of doing this.
Karuna was one of the great qualities of Lord Buddha to understand the sadness of the people.
It is said that the Buddhist monks travelled in different countries and used to take the rich ideas of Lord Buddha along with them.
The entire Asia has got the legacy of the teachings of Lord Buddha.
Many Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar have deepened many Buddhist traditions and Buddhist teachings and for this reason we are developing infrastructure for Buddhist tourism, which will connect important Buddhist places in Southeast Asia to India's important Buddhist places.
I am happy that the Government of India is a partner in the revival of several Buddhist temples, which includes the beautiful Ananda temple of Bagan in Myanmar hundreds of years ago.
Today, the teachings of Lord Buddha show the path of harmony to end the evil.
I convey my best wishes to all those who believe in the principles of compassion and devotion to Lord Buddha all over the world.
We seek the blessings of Lord Buddha for the entire world so that we can fulfill our responsibility for the creation of a peaceful and kind world based on their teachings.
Today, when we remember Lord Buddha, you must have heard about the idols of Lafing Buddha, it is believed that Lafing Buddha brings good fortune but very few people know that Smayling Buddha is also associated with an important event in India's defence history.
Now you will be wondering what is the relationship between Smiling Buddha and India's armed forces
That was the day of Buddha Purnima.
The nuclear test was conducted on 11th May, 1998 at Pokhran, Rajasthan.
Twenty years have been completed and with the blessings of Lord Buddha, this test was done on Buddha Purnima.
Indias tests have succeeded and India has shown its strength in the field of science and technology.
We can say that that day has been marked as its military force in the history of India.
Lord Buddha has shown to the world that internal power is essential for peace.
Similarly, when we become strong as a nation, we walk with each other in a peaceful way.
As nuclear tests were conducted in the month of May 1998, this month is not only important for the country but it is important for the way these tests were conducted.
This incident showed the whole world that India's land is the land of great scientists and India can achieve new heights with a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra of Jai-Jawan Jai-Kisan, Jai-Science.
We are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of 11th May 1998 and every young man should contribute to the creation of a modern India, to build a powerful India by adopting the mantra of Jai Vigyan which Atal ji had given us for the power of India.
Contribute your strength to the strength of India.
We will also be able to get a new joy and a new solution to take the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, we will meet in the next Mann Ki Baat programme and we will sing again.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat March 2018
Today is the holy festival of Ramnavami.
A few days ago, when all the heads of the ASEAN nation came here on 26th January, the art teams of that country had also come here.
And it is a matter of great pride that most of them have presented Ramayana to us.
This means that Ramayana and Ramayana are not only in India but also in this land of the world, the ASEAN countries are still as effective and inspirational.
Once again I congratulate you all on Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, just like this, I have received letters, emails, phone calls and responses from all of you.
I read what Komal Thakkar has written about the launch of the online class of Sanskrit on My-Gov.
I read the response written by Shri Yut Dhanshyam Kumar ji of Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar on the Narendra Modi app.
The concern that you have expressed on the declining waterfall of the land is of course very important.
Shri Yut Shakal Shastri ji of Karnataka used the words very well that Ayushman Bharat is possible only when Ayushman Bhoomi is there.
Shri Yogesh Bhadresha ji says that I should talk about the health of the youth at this time.
According to them, if we compare to other Asian countries, Indian youth are physically weak.
Yogesh ji, I thought that at this time I will discuss the matter of health in detail with all.
The Government of India had shared all the photos and videos on the social media and the Narendra Modi app on the same day.
Now you take the photograph and retweet it and reach your friends.
Anga, Jaiesh and many other children from Chennai have written and explained to me the ideas he had received in his mind about the gratitude cards that he has given behind the book 'Exam Warrior'.
Anga, Jaiesh and other children, I would like to tell you all that these letters will cause my tiredness all day.
I had a lot of things that I could read in such letters, such phone calls and reactions.
Today, even though I have decided to tell the same thing, I will have to say the same for months and months.
On this occasion, more and more letters have been sent by children, they have written about the examination.
Your plans have told me on holidays.
Animals and birds do not get water in the summer.
Farmer brothers and sisters have sent letters to the farmers' fairs and those things that happen in the country.
Some aware citizens have suggested measures for water conservation.
Since we have started this Mann Ki Baat through radio, I have experienced a way in which maximum number of letters come to the topics related to summer.
Previously, there are letters about the care of the examination of the students.
That is, things of mind change according to the weather and perhaps it is true that these things of our mind change the weather of anybody else's life and why not change it
When I get to read in your letters, how the Raksha Chalak of Karimganj, Assam, Ahmad Ali, had built nine schools for the poor children on the strength of his will, then I had a glimpse of our country's incomparable will.
When I got to hear the words of Dr. Abhit Mohan Chaudhary of Kanpur, they go to the pavement and feed the poor and do free medicines then I get the opportunity to feel the brotherhood of the country.
Several passengers travelling through their cabs have helped a lot.
An engineer girl gave her first full salary.
After depositing 12 years of money, the Bhagirath efforts of Akher Sadul Laskar were successful.
Today, due to his commitment and his hard work, he has built a sickle of about 30 beds in Punri village near Kolkata.
Today the vision of the whole world towards India has changed.
Today, when the name of India is taken with great pride, the sons and daughters of Mother India are hiding behind them.
Aspirations have created a positive atmosphere of self-confidence.
This self-confidence will fulfil our resolve of a New India.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for our farmer brothers and sisters.
Whether it is Mahatma Gandhi or Shastriji or Lohia ji or Chaudhary Charan Singh ji or Chaudhari Devi Lal ji, all of them considered agriculture and farmers as part of the economy of the country and an integral part of the common life.
In addition, Lal Bahadur Shastri was also focusing on the protection of trees, plants and vegetation and better agricultural structure.
In his address in 1979, Chaudhary Charan Singh had urged the farmers to use new technologies, innovate and utilize them.
This state, which has a very low area, has made a big achievement.
Our farmers of Meghalaya have recorded record production during 2015-16 over the last five years.
They have proved that when the goals are fixed, the resolutions will be fulfilled, they will be fulfilled by their experiences.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, an important decision has been taken to ensure that the farmers get the right price.
It has been ensured that in the notification, crops will be given minimum guarantee of their production expenditure by one and a half times.
The cost of fertilizers, the cost of fertilizers, the cost of fertilizers, the cost of fertilizers, the cost of all kinds of fertilizers used by the state government, the interest given to the state government, the farm land on hired, the farming will not only be rented but if the farmer does his own hard work or any of his family works in the field then the value of his labour will also be added to the cost of production.
Besides, the work of improving the agricultural market is also going on at a comprehensive level across the country so that the farmers can get the right market for their crops.
Efforts are being made to bring together local markets in the villages, housing markets and then global markets.
To ensure that farmers do not have to go far away to sell their goods, they are being modernized by providing the necessary infrastructure to 22,000 rural markets in the country and they will be connected to the Agricultural Income Market Committee and e-NAM platform.
That is, arrangements are being made to connect agriculture to any market in the country.
My dear countrymen, this year is the beginning of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
How should the country celebrate this festival
Besides, Swachh Bharat is our resolve, how can we collect 125 crore citizens and pay their best tributes to Gandhiji
How should Gandhi be the concept of 150
Together, let us pay a commemorative tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and inspire him and take our country to a new height.
Today, the country has moved ahead with a traditional approach in the field of health.
It was understood that the responsibility of all the health related works in the country was earlier only from the Health Ministry.
But now all the Ministries and Departments, Ministry of Sanitation, Ministry of AYUSH, Department of Chemicals Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs or Ministry of Women and Child Development or State Governments are working together for a healthy India.
The preventive care of health is the cheapest and easiest solution .
This will help the people, the family and the society as much as we are aware of the healthcare.
Besides, work is being done at a comprehensive level in the direction of setting up healthcare centres across the country.
Today Yoga has created a new identity in the field of preventive healthcare.
The body remains healthy and strong by yoga
Today, Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home due to the commitment of all of you to Yoga.
This year's International Day of Yoga is another 100 days on 21st June.
In the last three years, people participated in every International Day of Yoga in the country and everywhere in the world with great enthusiasm.
This year too, we will do Yoga ourselves and inspire our entire family, friends and others to do Yoga.
We have to work towards making Yoga more popular by reaching out to children, youth and senior citizens and women and men of every adult.
However, the television and electronic media of the country continue to do various Yoga programmes throughout the year.
But can some programmes that create awareness about Yoga as a campaign from today to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga teacher but Yoga is definitely a practice.
However, some people have made me Yoga teachers using their innovation and have made some 3D animated video of me doing Yoga.
I will be able to practice asanas and pranayama together to all of you.
Today, more than 3,000 Janaushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are available at affordable prices.
The work of setting up new centres is also going on.
I urge the followers of Mann Ki Baat to ensure that the information of these Janaushadhi Kendras reach the needy people, that is, their cost of medicines will be very low and they will have a huge service.
The cost of stents required for heart patients has been reduced by 85.
The cost of equipment required for knee implant surgery has been reduced by 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, about 10 crore families i. e.
The total number of seats in 479 medical colleges present in the country has been increased to 68,000.
New AIIMS are being opened in different states to provide better treatment and healthcare facilities to the people across the country.
A new medical college will be started for each three districts.
Our goal is to make the entire country TB free by 2025.
This is a lot of work.
There is a need to create awareness for every individual and help you.
To get rid of tuberculosis all of us will have to work together.
My dear countrymen, this is the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
Many years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had expressed the need for industrialization in the country.
He believed that industries can also provide employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, the Make in India campaign is being successfully launched in the country.
In such a situation, Dr. Ambedkars dream of becoming an Industrial Power is inspiring us.
Today, India has emerged as the brightest star in the world's economy and the world's largest foreign direct investment is being made in India today.
The world is looking at India as a hub for investment, research and development.
Today, Smart City Mission and City Mission have been launched to provide better roads, water supply, healthcare, education, digital connectivity in big cities and small towns of the country.
Babasaheb had a strong faith in self-sufficiency.
He was not acknowledged that no one should take life in poverty.
At the same time, he also believed that the poverty of the poor will not be overcome by providing affordable assistance to the poor.
Today, initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Start-up India, Stand-up India are creating young researchers and young entrepreneurs in the country.
He had seen Jal Shakti as a nation power.
It was Babasaheb's vision to set up several rivers and water related commissions.
Today, historic efforts are being made to develop waterways and ports in the country.
Ports are developing at different sea shores of India and infrastructure in the old ports are being strengthened.
In the 40s, the main issues of the discussion were the other wars, cold wars and fatalities.
At the same time, Dr. Ambedkar laid the foundation stone of Team India.
He spoke of the importance of the federal system and emphasized the need to work together by the Union and States for the development of the country.
Today, we have taken the mantra of cooperative federalism in every department of governance and competitive cooperative federalism.
And most importantly, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for crores of backward classes like me.
He showed us that there is no need to be born in a rich or prestigious family, but even those born in a poor family in India can see big dreams, try to fulfil them and succeed in them.
Sometimes many people took care of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This is an India that belongs to Ambedkar, the poor and the backward classes.
The Gram-Swaraj Abhiyan will be organized from 14th April to 5th May on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
It will have various programmes on rural development, poverty welfare and social justice across the country.
I urge all of you to participate in this programme in large numbers.
My dear countrymen, in the coming days many festivals like Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Baisakhi are coming.
Lord Mahavir Jayanti is a day to learn from his sacrifice and penance.
The life and teachings of Lord Mahavir who gave the message of non-violence are inspiring for all of us.
Best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti.
The Easter said that he remembers the inspirational teachings of Lord Jesus and gave the message of peace, harmony, justice, compassion and compassion to humanity.
Baisakhi festival is celebrated in Punjab and West India in April.
Many thanks.
We have seen that the color of the sea looks blue but in our daily life we feel that the water is blue and it is not colored.
Whether it is the river or the sea or the water there is a colour of it, should we ever think of it
This question came in the minds of a young man in the 1920s.
This question has led to the emergence of a great scientist of modern India.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for excellent work on light skating.
His discovery is famous by the name of Raman Effect.
On 28th February, Raman had discovered the light skating, so we celebrate 28th February as the National Science Day every year, he received the Nobel Prize.
This country has given several great scientists in the field of science.
On the one hand, the tradition of great mathematician Bodhyan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta, on the other hand, Sushrut and Charak have a place of pride in healthcare.
From Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Har Gobind Khurana, scientists like Satyendranath Bose are proud of India.
Satyendra Nath Bose has also been named as the famous Boson particle.
Recently, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme of Wadhwani Artificial Intelligence Institute in Mumbai.
It was very interesting to learn about the miracles of science.
Artificial intelligence helps in creating robots and distinguished machines.
Nowadays, the machines are smoothly smarting their minds through their own study.
This technology can be used to ease the lives of poor, deprived and needy.
In this programme of artificial intelligence, I had called upon the scientific community to use artificial intelligence to make the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters easier.
Can we guess the natural calamities through artificial intelligence
A few days ago, with the Prime Minister of Israel, we got the opportunity to inaugurate the ICRET in Ahmedabad in Gujarat.
There a young man had developed a digital device that cannot speak, a silent person has written that his voice is transformed and we can interact with him as we talk to a person.
I believe that in many such places we can use artificial intelligence.
The machine works like your wishes.
However, what we want to do is dependent on us.
Here human objectives are important, the use of science for human welfare, the use of science to achieve the highest height of human life.
Thomas Alva Adison, who discovered the electrical divine divine lighting, was often lost in many of his experiments.
Asked him about this, he said that I have discovered 10,000 methods of how electricity cannot be constructed.
Today I am here in Auroville, the workplace of Maharshi Aurobindo.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them and asked for answers to their rule.
As a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
He discovered the answer and guided humanity.
The feeling of repeated questions to know the truth is important.
This is also a true inspiration behind scientific research.
Whether or not the answers to these questions should not be made healthy until they get the answers.
On National Science Day, I congratulate all those associated with our scientific and scientific fields.
My best wishes to our younger generation to be inspired to discover truth and knowledge and to be inspired to serve the society with the help of science.
Friends, I have a lot of messages on the issue of calamity, in times of crisis, security and disaster. People are writing something or the other.
Poonahun Rabindra Singh has written the Narendra Modi Mobile App on Professional Safety in his response.
He wrote that the quality of safety in our country is not as good as in factories and construction sites.
On the occasion of Indias National Security Day on 4th March, the Prime Minister should take up the topic of Safety in his Mann Ki Baat programme, which will enhance awareness among the people about safety.
When we talk about public security, two things are important, readiness and preparedness.
Safety is of two types one which is required during disasters and the other is necessary in daily life.
We are not aware of safety in everyday life but it is difficult to achieve security during disasters.
If we remain cautious, if we follow the necessary rules then we can protect our lives and save our society from great accidents.
We see that there are many things written about safety at workplace but it does not seem to be followed.
The municipalities and municipalities, who have firecrackers, should go to different schools once a week or a month and make a mock drill in front of the students.
It will have two benefits, the firefighters will also have the habit of being cautious and the new generation will also get education and there is no need to spend differently. In a way, it becomes a part of education.
If we talk about disasters and crises, India is geographically driven by diversity.
The country has witnessed some natural, man-made, disasters and chemical and industrial accidents.
NDMA i.e. National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) focuses on disaster management of the country.
NDMA runs quickly in disasters such as earthquake, floods, storms, landslides.
Training and awareness have an important role.
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year due to heat and then NDMA launched a campaign to create awareness about this and organized workshops.
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can achieve security.
The brave soldiers of the Fire Services, the National Disaster Response Force, the Armed Forces, the Armed Forces and the Armed Forces do not lose their lives during the crisis.
NCCs and Scouts also help in this work, training and training.
This was the first and comprehensive endeavour of joint disaster management of BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal.
These values should be an integral part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in this budget, the emphasis has been laid on creating wealth from waste and waste to the villages through biogas.
The initiative has been initiated with the name of Gobar Dhan, Galvehnaizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
In some European countries and China, energy is generated from sugarcane and biological fertilizers but it was not used in India with full potential.
We are moving towards this direction under the Swachh Bharat Mission Rural.
The objective of utilising livestock, waste in the field, waste in the kitchen is to be used for bio-based energy generation.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers and brothers and sisters of rural India will be encouraged to see sugarcane and waste not only as a waste but as a source of income.
The Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and help in keeping the villages clean.
Farmers and animal husbandry will help in increasing income.
The collection of garbage, its transportation and the sale of biogas will lead to employment opportunities.
A online platform will be set up for smooth implementation of Gobar Dhan Yojana, which will connect the farmers to the consumer and provide a fair price for sugarcane and agricultural waste goods.
I urge the entrepreneurs, especially the sisters living in rural India to take initiatives and prepare a Self Help Group and take advantage of this opportunity by creating a cooperative committee.
I invite you to become a partner of this movement for clean energy and green employment and take initiatives to convert the waste into wealth and convert sugarcane into wealth.
Different art works have been prepared using waste.
Workshops were organised to train people on all aspects of waste management.
Everyone had innovative ideas about cleanliness, had spoken and presented poems.
There was a festive atmosphere about cleanliness.
In particular, school students participated in the event.
I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which this festival was celebrated for waste management and cleanliness.
Every year, 8th March is celebrated as International Womens Day.
Several programmes are organized in the country and around the world.
This day, women who have done remarkable work in different fields are honoured.
Today the country is moving ahead with women development and is moving towards women-led development.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's thoughts, he said that the ideal women concept is full freedom.
The idea of Swamiji 250 years ago expresses concern about women's power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
We are a part of the tradition where men are identified by women, the son of Sayogda, the son of Kaushalya, the son of Gandhi.
Women are empowered, strong, equal partners in the development of the country. This is the dream of a New India.
A few days ago, a person had suggested me a good thing, he said that on March 8, there are several programmes on Women's Day.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representatives, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis 50 thousand Raj Mistry.
You can imagine how big is the event.
The women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is the power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will transform the Swachhta Abhiyan into the nature of the people in the common life.
Brothers and sisters, Two days ago I had told that after the independence of three villages in Elephanta Islands, electricity was reached after 70 years of independence, there was happiness among the people.
You know that this island is 10 kilometers away from Mumbai.
For 70 years, in three villages of Elephanta, the life of Rajbandar, Morbandar and Set Port had spread darkness in the lives of people.
I convey my best wishes to the administration and the people there.
I am glad that Elephanta village and caves have now come out shining.
This is not just a power but a new introduction.
What can be a matter of joy beyond the brightness of the lives of the countrymen and joy in their lives
My dear brothers and sisters, We just celebrated the festival of Mahashivaratri.
It is a special feature of the month of March, the hypnotising of the crops and the hypnotising of the AMR.
We love this month for the festival of Holi.
On March 2, Holi will be celebrated with enthusiasm across the country.
Holi has the importance of colour as well as Holika Dahna has the importance of burning the evil nature.
May this festival be happy in the lives of our countrymen.
Thank you very much for my dear countrymen, Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January 2018
Today, for the first time I have been talking to you through Mann Ki Baat in 2018.
Two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Day with great enthusiasm.
The event was attended by the Chief Guests of 10 countries for the first time in history.
My dear countrymen, today I will mention the letter of Prakash Tripathy.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that women are progressing at a rapid pace in every sector in India, are moving forward and raising the neck of the country.
Since ancient times, the honour given to women in our country, their place in society and their contributions are very big and new in terms of the whole world.
There is a great tradition of great scholars in India.
Several scholars of India have contributed significantly to the creation of Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gargi and Maitreya cannot be named.
This woman power keeps the entire country, the entire society, the family in the threshold of unity.
Whether it is the great scholars like Lopamudra, Gargi and Maitreya of Vedic times, the great scholars like Akka Mahadeo and Meerabai, the saints of the great wise and devotional ways or the governance system like Ahilyabai Holkar or the brave battlefield like Rani Laxmibai, women power has always inspired us.
Prakash Tripathy has mentioned several examples in his letter.
He has written that our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's journey from Sukhoi-30 fighter aircraft inspires him.
The three brave women of Bhavn Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi have become arbitrarily arbitrarily trained in Sukhoi-30.
Just a few days ago, the Honble President started a new thing.
The President met a group of women who have performed extraordinary achievements for the first time in their field.
Our women's power has done extraordinary work to break the sequences of conservation in the society and established a new record.
He showed that hard work, tireless efforts and if there is a strong resolve, if there is any difficulty, if there is any obstacle then we can cross them and create a new path.
Now this path inspires not only our contemporary people but also generations.
This book is available in the e-book format of Narendra Modi Website.
Today, the women power of this country has a very important role in the positive changes in the country and the society.
Today, when you are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station here.
Now we might have got the idea of what is the relationship between a railway station and women empowerment.
The first railway station in India is Matunga Railway Station in Mumbai.
There are women employees in all the departments in this station.
After watching the path breaking of the Republic Day, a number of people wrote on Witter and other social media that all women were involved in the BSF Bikar Continent.
These women were experiencing adventurous experiments and also surprised the guests from abroad and they felt new.
Both words of empowerment and self-reliance are the same.
Today our women are leading.
They are becoming self-reliant.
But our tribal women and women of Chhattisgarh have created a new picture in front of the country.
The campus of Dantewada district in Chhattisgarh is under the influence of Maoism.
The Maoists have created an extremely terrible atmosphere of violence, atrocities, bombs, guns and pistols.
In such a dangerous area tribal women are becoming self-reliant by running e-rickshaws.
The introduction of any social life is from whether the system of reform has been developed or not.
Efforts are being made in our country at the individual and social level against social evil and evil practices.
A good effort was made in Bihar just a few days ago.
In order to eradicate social evils, more than 13,000 kilometres of human chain has been created in the state, which was the longest human chain in the world.
In this campaign, people created awareness among the society against evil practices like child marriage, hunting etc.
The entire state resolved to fight against evils like Hunda and Balviwah.
Youth, mothers and sisters participated in this campaign.
Beginning from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patan, this human sequence has been linked to the borders of the state.
Our society should be freed from such mischiefs so that all the people of the society need to benefit from development in the true sense.
Let us take a pledge to eliminate all these evils from the society and build a New India, a strong and capable India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of the state, the administration there and every person involved in the human categories.
However, after getting the information about the Jan Aushadhi Kendra, they have started buying medicines from there and now the cost of their parents' medicines has come down by 75.
This provides huge financial assistance to the common man, particularly senior citizens of medicines everyday.
The Generic medicines which are purchased are the standards set by the World Health Organisations.
This is the reason why good quality medicines are available at affordable rates.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This not only provides medicines cheaper but also provides new employment opportunities to the individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras and the Amrit Stores of the hospitals.
The only objective of these schemes is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country and to build a healthy and prosperous India.
My dear countrymen, Shri Yut Mangesh from Maharashtra has sent a picture on the Narendra Modi mobile app.
With the separation of this picture, my attention will turn towards it.
In this picture, a mother was involved in the Swachhta Abhiyan Clin Morana River along with her adolescents.
I have been told that the citizens of Akola have started programmes to clean the Mora river in the Swachh Bharat Mission.
One more painful thing is that wild grass and water leaf was fountained in the river vessels.
Waste was thrown on the rivers and its edges.
A work plan was prepared by the villagers and a day before the Makar Sankranti, the Swachh Morna Mission was prepared on 13th January, according to which the two shores of Morana river were cleaned at four places in the first phase of four kilometres.
I have been told that till the Morana river is completely clean, this campaign will continue every Saturday in the morning.
One can be seen from this thing that if a person decides to do something then there is nothing inevitable.
Through the mass movement, it can bring about changes by doing big things.
My dear countrymen, today there is a lot of discussion about the Padma Awards and you will definitely listen to it.
Every year there is a tradition of giving Padma Awards but for the last three years the entire process of this award has been changed.
Now any citizen can introduce any name for this award.
This entire process has been transparent due to online.
Now the importance of the work done by the person is being remembered and introduced to the award.
You must have heard that you will be happy to know the work of Arvind Gupta ji.
Aurobindo ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, has spent his life in creating sports for young children.
They are constantly trying to find out the sciences of the children in useless and unsuccessful things.
He went to three thousand schools across the country and showcased the paintings made in 18 different languages and inspired the children.
This is the same thing with Sitava Joddi of Karnataka.
He was not only addressed as the goddess of women empowerment.
Sitava has contributed greatly to bring about changes in the lives of innumerable women in Belagavi for the last three decades.
In the seventh year of age, they were dedicated to themselves as Devdasi but Sitavas spent their entire life for the welfare of Devdasis.
Not only this, he has also done a great job for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard a lot about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh and Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor tribal family.
He used to do a simple job for slaughtering but he used to have traditional tribal paintings and paintings.
He has been honoured not only in India but also in the entire world.
In many countries like Netherlands, Germany, England, Italy, their pictures have been displayed.
The Padma Shri award has been given to him by recognizing the talent of Bhajju Shyam ji, who is the name of India in foreign countries.
He has built more than 500 medicinal plants on the basis of his memories.
He has been awarded the Padmashree Award for discovering and discovering these renowned persons who have done their social work.
Today, I am pleased to mention another name here and the 75-year-old Subhashini Mistry of West Bengal has also been selected for the Padma Awards.
Subhasini Mistry rubbed utensils in other houses to build a hospital and sold vegetables.
This crisis in life inspired them to build a hospital for the poor.
Today thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in their hospitals built by their tireless hard work.
The Padma Award is a medium and I would like to tell the countrymen that there are millions of people who are working for the society, who live for the society, who have dedicated their lives, who have been working for the society and who have been working for the entire life with some or the other special goals and sometimes bring them to society.
Such people do not work at all for respect.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Revered Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa on 9th January.
On this day, we are celebrating the festivals of Indians living in India and the world.
You will surely be happy to know that the mayor, MPs and representatives of Indian origin from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and the United States and many other countries participated in this event.
I would like to thank the European Union for making a remarkable work, identification of the people of the original Indian origin and giving this information to the people of the entire world through a vision.
Those who have shown a new path to all of you, the date of revered Bapu is on 30th January.
The path of peace and non-violence is the path of Bapu, be it India or the world, be it individual or family or society.
Namaskar
This is the last programme of Mann Ki Baat in this year and look at Yoga, today is the last day of the year 2017.
In this year, we have spoken a lot of things together and shared a lot.
Some of them used to give new energy to me innumerable letters, reactions and exchanges from you people for Mann Ki Baat.
Now this year will change in a few hours but this will continue to be the master of our conversations.
In the coming years, we will also discuss new topics and share new experiences.
My best wishes to all of you for 2018.
Just a few days ago, on December 25, Christmas festival was celebrated across the world with great enthusiasm.
We also see the essence of service in the Bible.
The Sun of Man Haz Kam, NOT TO B Servant, But to Servant, And to Give Hiz Life, Az Blassingtu All Humankind.
In these lengths, what is the service name Mahatva, what is the greatness.
Be it any caste, religion, tradition, description, but the invaluable form of humanity is being introduced through service.
In our country, Nishkam Karma is being spoken about, Nishkam Karma is not expecting, served.
We are also called 'Seva Parmo Dharma:'.
Jeevan-Seva Hi Shiv-Seva and Gurudev Ramakrishna Paramhansa have said that life-service should be done with the spirit of life.
My dear countrymen, this year was the 350th light year of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
An extraordinary life filled with the bravery and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is an inspiration for all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached great values and he himself lived on the basis of those values.
Guru Gobind Singh ji inspired the people through all the roles of a Guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior.
He fought against atrocities and injustice.
He taught people to bind the bonds of caste and religion.
In all these efforts, they had to face a lot at the personal level.
However, he never gave up the feeling of evil in his mind.
He continued to convey the message of love, sacrifice and peace every moment in his life.
It shows how great and unique their personality is.
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to participate in the light festival organized here on the occasion of 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
January 1, 2018.
You will also be surprised that the new year used to come and January 1 also comes every year.
But whenever I say special, it is really special.
And I urge all of you to register your names as a voter.
The entire India is keen to welcome its 21st century voters.
As a 21st century voter, we will also feel that we are honoured.
Our opinion will be the basis of New India.
The strength of the vote in democracy is the biggest power.
Voting is the most effective tool to bring about a positive change in the lives of millions of people.
We do not have the right to vote.
So, how should India be in the 21st century and what should our dreams be in the 21st century India
We will also be able to become the builder of India in the 21st century and it will start from January 1.
I am confident that our dream of New India will be fulfilled with the strength of the skills towards this vibrant youth.
When we talk about New India, this New India should be free from evils such as ethnicism, communalism, terrorism, corruption.
They should be free from cleanliness and poverty.
Peace, unity and harmony should be our guide force in New India.
Let us interact with the youngsters of New India to come forward and see how a New India should be.
They should also set a way for themselves and those who have been associated with it will be such a big group.
We will continue to move forward and the country will continue to move forward.
As soon as I was interacting with you, I had a thought in my mind that can we organise a Mock Parliament in every district of India
Could the youth of 18-25 years of age be able to collectively discuss the issue of New India and explore various ways and plans
Before the year 2022, how will we be able to achieve our resolve
What can we do to build India in the dreams of our freedom fighters
Mahatma Gandhi had made the movement of freedom as a mass movement.
My young friends, today the need of the hour is to create a mass movement for a magnificent and divine India in the 21st century.
Today, innumerable new opportunities have been created for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are moving forward and are also successful.
I want to know about all these schemes and build an independent system by considering how the youth of this New India can get the same place.
My dear countrymen, I had been telling you about the importance of Mann Ki Baat as positive.
Any work is possible for those who have positiveity and zeal.
People in English say that "Passimism Lids to Weekness, Optimism to Power" had called upon the countrymen to share the positive moments you have experienced in 2017 and welcome to 2018 in a positive environment.
People have given a lot of positive response to the social media portals, MyGov and Narendra Modi App and have shared their experiences.
Some people have done some special work in their individual life.
My name is Minu Bhatia, sound bytes.
I live here in Mayur Vihar, Pocket-One, Phase One, Delhi.

I will be able to get this loan very easily and my daughter will continue to learn.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I used to speak from the Bodel.
My name is Santosh Jadhav.
The work of National Highways has been done in 2017 from our Bhinnar village.
This is why our roads have become very good and business is shining.
My name is Dipanshu Ahuja.
I live in Mohalla Sadatganj in Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.
My name is Satish Bewani.
There was a very serious problem of water in our region and for the last 40 years we were dependent on the climate of the Army.
Now we have become an independent circulation.
Let us enter the New Year with the joy of such small things, let us take a pledge to move towards a progressive India from the beginning of the New Year.
Now we all are discussing positiveness, so I am also keen to say one thing here.
Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak, who recently got the highest position in the Administrative Services Examination in Kashmir, is very encouraging me.
He was the first in the Kashmir Administrative Services Examination by emerging from the atmosphere of terrorism and Kamali.
He wrote the story of success in his own hands.
Today Anjum has become an inspiration for not only Jammu and Kashmir but also for the youth of the entire country.
Even though the situation is bad, it has proved that the despair of disappointment can be destroyed through positive work.
Recently, I got the opportunity to meet some girls of Jammu and Kashmir in the last week.
I used to know the desires and zeal that they had in their dreams.
He used to say that in which field he wants to progress in his life, it was a mandal that had a great hope in his mind.
I feel like talking to them, there is no despair among them.
There was enthusiasm, joy, joy, energy, great dreams and resolves.
The time I spent with these Kashmiri daughters, I was also inspired by them.
This is my youth today. This is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to know about the temples of Sabarimala in Kerala when there was talk of famous religious places not only in our country but all over the world.
Millions of devotees come every year to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyappa Swami in this world famous temple.
P.
Nobody is big in this campaign, nobody is small.
Every traveller understands a part of the worship of God and works in some way or the other.
No matter how big a celebrities, no matter how big a person is, no matter how big a person is, no matter how big a person is working in a big position, everybody is involved in this Punyam Punkvanam programme like a common traveller.
There are many such examples for our countrymen.
There is also a strong resolution of cleanliness along with the tough drives.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, we all have made a pledge to make Swachh Bharat a Swachh Bharat Free India.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level across the country towards cleanliness.
The participation of people in rural and urban areas is also changing.
The worlds largest Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be held in the coming 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine how much cleanliness level is in urban areas and how much the cleanliness drive is being achieved.
This survey will be conducted in more than 4,000 cities and about 40 crore populations of the country.
It will be detailed whether toilet free in the cities, waste collection, waste transportation system, scientific waste management, the efforts made to change the habits of the people, the efforts of the people in this work are being made to build capabilities and to use some innovative innovations for cleanliness.
During the period of the survey, various teams are going to examine cities.
They will also interact with the citizens and understand their responses.
The Swachhta App is being used and will be analyzed to improve different types of services.
This work is not just the government, it is not at all.
However, every citizen and citizen organisation has a great responsibility in maintaining cleanliness.
And I urge every citizen to participate in the Swachhta Survey in large numbers.
And make a pledge that your city should not be asked about cleanliness, your streets and your society should not be left behind.
I am confident that you must have a habit of classifying dry waste and wet waste in Gharamdha and you will be using blue and green waste while waste.
Reduce, Reuse and Recycle theory is very effective for waste.
If the population of our city is more than one lakh then we should dream that if there is a population of more than one lakh, if there is a population of less than one lakh then we should achieve the highest number in the regional order.
And we should also make efforts like this.
And the dream of all of us should be our city- our efforts, our progress and progress of the country.
Let us recall the revered Bapu by making such a pledge, let us recognise our efforts to fulfil the resolve of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, there are some things that seem very small but if we look at it as a society then we become an identity.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share one such thing with you.
I realized that if a Muslim woman wants to go to Hajjar Yatra then she cannot go without a maharam or her male.
Specially, such bonds are not even in Islamic countries.
But in India, only Muslim women did not get this right.
And I am very happy to note here that our government should take care of this thing.
I have full faith and I firmly believe that the journey of India's development will continue to move forward on the strength of our women and their talent.
And therefore, our efforts should be made to ensure that our women also get equal rights and equal opportunities along with men and women and men go ahead in the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26 January is a historic festival for you.
The day of January 26, 2018 will be specially remembered.
This year, the Republic Day celebrations will be attended by all the 10 ASEAN countries as leading guests.
This year, the Republic Day will not be one but ten chief guests.
The year 2017 has been special for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed its 50 years in 2017 and in 2017, India's partnership with ASEAN completed 25 years.
It is a matter of pride for all of our Indians to participate with these great leaders of 10 countries of the world on 26th January.
Friends, Dear countrymen, if we see the festivals and festivals, then our country is a country of festivals.
Perhaps no day will be said that no festival is celebrated on that day.
May the coming New Year bring all of you a lot of happiness, happiness and prosperity.
Let us all move forward with new zeal, new zeal, new joy and new resolve.
In the month of January, the Uttarayan of the Sun will start and this month is celebrated as Makar Sankranti, which is linked to nature.
In Rajasthan, Sankrant is called Magha-Bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu.
All these festivals are usually celebrated during 13th to 17th January.
Thank you very much, dear countrymen.
Now we are going to say this again in 2018.
The Indian citizens will not be able to find out that they do not feel respected.
At that age, we are bigger than all of us and they are witnesses of different phases of the country.
I was fortunate to have a telephone conversation with Didi before my departure for a foreign visit.
It was a lovely dialogue between us in such a way that we should talk to our elder sisters with a small feeling.
I don't really talk about such a personal speech.
Listen to me that even on this movement of life, Latadi is eager and ready for every thing related to the country.
The spirit of satisfaction in his life is linked to India's progress, it is linked to changing India, it is linked to India that is moving new heights of progress.
Modi ji: Latadi Namaskar.
I am speaking Narendra Modi.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: I used to travel on the plane.
Lata ji: Okay, okay.
What should be celebrated on the day of development
And the achievement we have achieved has been achieved through the means and penance.
I'm not really anything.
Lata ji: yeah.
Your letters are also available to me and I also get your visits.
I do not want to give you a lot of trouble because I see, I imagine how much work you used to do and how many things you have to think about.
Modi ji: My mother was very happy with your affection.
Lata ji: Homodi ji: but I will be here soon.
Festivals will continue throughout the country for the next several weeks.
Your houses will be filled with joy.
However, you must have seen that there are many people around you who are deprived of the happiness of these festivals.
It is also called darkness under the light.
Most of these words are not just words but there is an order for us, there is a philosophy and an inspiration.
Whenever sweets, clothes and gifts come in our homes, then you should go out for a minute.
Make sure that the things we don't use at least in our houses are more than required.
In many cities, many such institutions work with the start-ups of the youth partners.
They collect clothes, cereals and food from the houses of the people and find the needy and reach them.
The laughing on the faces of many poor families will double their joy of festivals, will shine on our faces, your lamps will be highlighted and our Diwali will shine further.
My dear brothers and sisters, Lakshmi is welcomed in the form of fortune and prosperity in Diwali.
Can we welcome Laxmi this year in a new way
Girls have been considered Lakshmi in our culture because girls bring good fortune and prosperity.
Can we organise programmes for the honour of girls in our society, in villages and cities this year
Can we programme this year for the honour of these Laxmis of India in Diwali
There will be many daughters and many golds around you who are doing extraordinary work.
Someone is working to teach the poor children, somebody is working to create awareness about cleanliness and health, somebody is doing a doctor or engineer and serving the society.
May our society recognise such people, honour them and be proud of them.
Such honour programmes should be held across the country.
One more thing.
Share more information about the success of these girls through social media and use the hashtag of Bharat Ki Laxmi.
We had launched the Selfie with Daughter Movement and it was spread all over the world, just like this, we should also run the campaign of Bharat Ki Laxmi at this time.
Promoting Indias Laxmi initiative means empowering the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had said earlier that Mann Ki Baat programme has a great advantage that I have the privilege of interacting directly or indirectly with many familiar and unknown persons.
A few days ago, Alina Tayang, a student from Arunachal Pradesh, has sent me a leaflet and he has written in it, I read that letter before you.
I live in Roing in Arunachal Pradesh.
This year when my examination took place, some people asked me whether you read the book Exam Warriors
I told them that I did not read this book.
But after going again I bought this book and read it two-three times.
After that, my experience was very good.
I felt that if I had read this book before the examination, I would have had a lot of benefit.
I believe that if you are thinking about the new chapter of this book, then you must include some more mantras and labour for parents and teachers.
Thank you for reading the book Exam Warriors two-three times and I am extremely grateful to you for telling me what is less in it while reading.
My little friend has also given me an order to do something.
I will certainly follow your orders.
Whatever you have said that when the new edition of this book comes, I will definitely try to write something for the parents and the teachers.
But I will urge you all to help me in this work.
What are your experiences in everyday life
I once again express my gratitude to this little friend of Arunachal and student Alina Tayang.
My dear countrymen, through newspapers, through television, you also talk about the ongoing programmes of the Prime Minister of the country.
But you know that I am also a common man like you, a common citizen and that is why the impact of things that can be seen on a common life is affecting my life as well as my mind because I am also one of you.
Then I also listened to the speeches and saw the confrontation.
A short while ago, he was defeated in the last round by the Grand Slam winner and the Emperor of the Tennis World, Rafael Nadal.
The audience present at his address was enthusiastically welcomed.
He also complimented the winners of Danil and said how Nadal has inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis.
Even after being defeated in the face of Atitati, he lauded his competitor Nadal and put an excellent example of sportsmanship in front of the world.
At the same time, on the other hand, winner Nadal also lauded the sports of Danil.
There is a lot to learn from every class and from every age group.
These are the moments that are beyond winning or losing when victory or defeat does not mean much.
The ideas of our ancestors were really commendable.
Vidya Vinay User Hartin Nursey Kasya Manujsya Mani Kanchan Samayog: Janayoti Loksya Lochan Andam i.e., when a person lives at the same time, then that person will not win any good mind
However, this young sportsperson has won the minds of all the people around the world.
My dear countrymen, and especially my young friends, what I am going to say is going to tell you for your good.
The debate will continue, the differences between the parties will continue, but if some matters are stopped before spreading fast then it will benefit greatly.
The things that grow at a rapid pace, the things that spread at a rapid pace becomes difficult after stopping them.
But in the beginning, if we wake up and stop it then a lot can be saved.
With this feeling, today I feel like talking to my beloved youth, especially to my beloved.
We all know that the intoxication of tobacco is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit intoxication .
Because of nicotine present in tobacco the quantity of intoxication is more in it .
By its consumption in adolescence there is adverse effect on the development of brain .
But today I would like to talk to you about a new subject.
You will be aware that recently e-cigarette restrictions have been implemented in India.
E cigarette is an electronic device different from regular cigarettes .
A kind of chemical smoke is produced because of the heat of nicotine rich smoke in cigarette , through which nicotine is consumed .
You may have a lot of information about the danger of cigarettes, but there has been a non-communication about e-cigarette that there is no danger due to e-cigarette.
Aromatic chemicals are used to prevent it from spreading like other cigarettes.
We have seen around us that there are fathers in many houses but they stop others from smoking and stop them from smoking.
The subject of e cigarette is different .
If someone smokes around you then he understands us from his dwelling.
If someone has a pocket of cigarettes then also he understands from Vasa only .
However, e-cigarette is not so much that many adolescents and youngsters are unaware and sometimes fashion statistics in their books, in their offices, in their wings and sometimes in their hands are seen roaming e-cigarettes and then become intoxicant.
Youth generation is the future of the country.
Cigarettes have been imposed so that this kind of drug addiction does not destroy our youth.
These provisions have been made to protect the dreams of the family from destruction, do not apply the lives of the children to the country and do not spread their hands in the society with the habit of drug addiction.
I urge you all to leave this intoxication of tobacco and do not have any unconsciousness about e cigarettes .
Let us together build a healthy India.
Hey, do you remember Fit India
Fit India does not mean that we go to the gym for two hours in the morning and evening.
For Fit India you will have to stay away from all these intoxications.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of privilege for you that our India has been the birthplace and workplace of many unusual people who have spent their lives for the welfare of others.
India is the birthplace of many such extraordinary people, Karmabhoomi and these are those people who have sacrificed their lives not only for themselves but for the welfare of others.
One such great person will be honored on 13th October at Vatican City.
This is certainly a matter of pride for every Indian, Pope Frances will announce Mary Thresia as a saint on October 13.
The work done by Cyster Mary Thresia for the welfare of humanity in his little life of just 50 years is a unique example for the entire world.
He was very compassionate about social service and education.
He built several schools, habitations and orphanages.
He established the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Family, which is still fulfilling their livelihoods and missions.
Once again I pay my homage to Sister Maryam Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for not the whole of India but for the world that 130 crore Indians have resolved to be free from single use plastic while celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.
Considering the role played by India in the direction of environmental protection, the vision of countries from all over the world remains intact to India.
I am confident that all of you will be participating in the campaign to get rid of single use plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing to this mission in their own way but a young man of our country has started a campaign in a unique way.
When I looked at his work, I had a telephone conversation with him and tried to learn this new experiment.
Perhaps the interaction with them will be beneficial to some other people of the country.
Mr. Ripudaman Belvi ji is making a unique effort.
When I first heard the word plagging, it was also new for me.
We are implementing this entire programme in a innovative way and especially in a way that will love the youth.
I congratulate you from your heart.
Friends, This year, the Ministry of Sports is also organizing the Fit India Planning Run on the occasion of the birth anniversary of respected Bapu.
Two kilometres of plugging on October 2.
This programme will be held all over the country.
We have heard from the experience of Ripudaman how to do this programme and what should be done in the programme.
Through this campaign, awareness about the health of the people is also increasing and awareness about cleanliness is also increasing.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step towards getting rid of single use plastic, then India will take 130 crore steps together.
Riputman ji, once again thank you very much.
My best wishes to you, your team and your innovation.
I would like to tell you a little about one thing.
However, in the next Mann Ki Baat programme, I will definitely tell you about it in detail, but today I am telling you that you should get the opportunity to prepare.
You must remember that on 31st October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is the birth anniversary.
So we should start preparing for it from now on.
There is only a detailed talk about this, but there is still time.
Some people can start the exercise and some other schemes can be prepared.
My dear countrymen, you must remember that on 15th August I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 we should visit 15 places in India.
Programme at least fifteen places and one or two night stay .
Let us see, understand, experience India.
We have so much diversity.
And whenever people come to Diwali on holidays, they will definitely go to roam and therefore I once again urge you to visit any fifteen places in India.
My dear countrymen, you will certainly be happy to know that Indias ranking has improved in the competitive index of tourism.
And it has been possible because of the cooperation of all of you, especially because of the importance of tourism.
If we make further efforts, we will certainly be able to take the top position in the major tourist destinations of the world when we complete 75 years of independence.
It should be happy, enthusiasm should also be there.
Our festivals are celebrated together and celebrated together, so that this collectiveness also gains a new strength of collective life.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to interact with the children of Karnataka.
The Times Group's 'Vijay Karnataka' newspaper launched an initiative in which he urged the children and the Prime Minister to send letters.
He also wrote that if you give more information about the nature of children then it will be useful in the future for environmental protection.
The daughter named Rida Nadaf of Lakshadweep has written that she is the daughter of a soldier and she feels proud of this thing.
Doesn't any Indian feel proud of the army personnel
And you are the daughter of that soldier, it is natural to feel proud of you.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has said that his school is 5 kilometres away from his village, so that he has to leave the house quickly and he is too late to return home.
He said that they cannot play longer with their friends and they should have a school near their homes.
Friends, I got the opportunity to save this letter from me.
It was a very good experience for me.
My dear countrymen, today is 2611.
26th November is our Constitution Day.
On this day in 1949, the Constituent Assembly accepted the event of India.
The implementation of the Constitution started on 26th January, 1950 and therefore we celebrate 26th January as Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constitution.
He worked hard for the constitution for nearly three years.
Any field of life, no subject of nature has been left in it.
For all, equality and sensitivity is the identity of our Constitution.
It is our duty to follow the characters of our Constitution.
Whether it is citizen or administrator, everybody should describe according to the Constitution.
This is the message of the Constitution that no one should suffer any harm.
The Mussoora Committee was one of the most important committees.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Committee.
He was playing a very big role.
He ensured that every section of the society will be benefitted.
On December 6, we remember him on his Mahaparinirvan Diwas.
Babasaheb has made a big contribution to the country's prosperity and empowerment.
On 15th December, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be on his death anniversary.
Sardar Patel, who was the son of the farmer to the iron man, also worked unusually to build the country in the same threshold.
Sardar Patel was also a member of the Constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for fundamental rights, Minorities and Tribals.
But nine years ago, the country cannot forget the terrorist attack on Mumbai on 26 11th day of today.
Today, the country salutes those brave citizens, police and security guards who lost their lives.
The country will never be able to forget their sacrifices.
He is ready to destroy human power.
And that is why not only India but all humanitarian powers in the world should unite and defeat terrorism.
Born on this land, Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi have given the message of non-violence and love to the world.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to weaken and destroy our social structure.
And that is why there is a need of time to be more aware of humanitarian powers.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Naval Day on 4th December.
The Indian Navy protects our maritime shores.
I congratulate all those associated with the Navy.
You must be aware that our culture has developed on the banks of the rivers.
Whether it is the Indus River, the River Ganga, the Yamuna or the Saraswati, our rivers and seas are important in both economic and strategic areas.
These are the entrances for the entire world.
This country has an unprecedented relationship with the oceans of our land.
When we look at history, 800-900 years ago the navy of the king was counted among the most capable naval navals during the Massage dynasty.
In the expansion of the Mallad empire, his naval lion shared the name of the empire as an economic power at that time.
Several examples of the expeditions and research journeys of the Maldives are still available in Sangam literature.
In most of the naval ships around the world, women's inclusion has been allowed in a long time later.
However, in the Massage Navy, and that too, 800-900 years ago, women had played the role of cattle.
These women were also involved in the war.
The Mass rulers had advanced knowledge of shipbuilding.
How can the capability of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his Navy be forgotten during the mention of the Navy
The territory of Konkan with maritime domination was included in the state of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud-Janjira, Swarnadurg related to Shivaji Maharaj were in the coastal areas or were standing in the sea.
The navy of the Marathas was protecting these forts.
The Marathas had large and small boats.
Their naval personnel were persuaded to attack any enemy and defend themselves from the attack.
It is only impossible to discuss Maratha Armaar and not mention Kanhoji Angre.
He gave a new glory to the architecture of the Marathas and laid the foundation stone of the Marathas soldiers at various places.
Even after independence, the Indian Navy often performed the valour.
Whether it is the freedom struggle of Goa or the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971.
The INS Sumitra of our Navy helped in immediate rescue and handed over a number of fishermen safely out of water to Bangladesh.
In the month of May-June this year, when there was a huge flood in Sri Lanka, three boats of our Navy arrived there immediately and they helped the government and the people there.
The INS Ghatial of our Navy had helped mankind in Rohingya in Bangladesh.
In June, the Papua New Guinea government gave us a message to the SOS and helped our Navy to save the fishermen of their fisherman boats.
On November 21, during the attack by marine marine ships on a trader ship in West Galf, the INS Trikand of its naval flew to the warship.
This is a day of pride and respect for the security forces of the country and the Ministry of Defence has decided to carry out a special campaign from 1st to 7th December this year.
Children, big men, all of them have flagged the national flag throughout the week.
There should be a movement to express respect to the armed forces across the country.
On this occasion, we can distribute the flag of the Army.
If any of your neighbors and your acquaintances are related to the army, their experiences, their brave actions, photographs and photographs related to them can be posted at the Hashtag Armedforcesflagday.
In schools and colleges, the Armed Forces will be invited to inform them about the work of the Armed Forces.
This is a great opportunity for our new generation to get more information about the armed forces.
This is also the opportunity to collect funds for the welfare of all our defence forces.
This fund is used for the welfare and rehabilitation of the injured soldiers for the families of the martyrs of the war through the Military Welfare Board.
Let us also contribute to the morale of our Armed Forces on this occasion.
Let us also take charge of their welfare.
My dear countrymen, on 5th December is the World Soil Day.
I would like to tell my farmer brothers and sisters too.
Soil is an important part of the earth.
Everything we eat is related to this soil.
In a way the entire food chain is connected to the soil.
Imagine what will happen if there is no nutritious soil in the world
How's the survivor
It was considered in our culture a long time ago and that is why we have been aware of the importance of soil since ancient times.
In our culture, on the one hand, the feeling of agriculture, devotion and respect for soil will be natural in the minds of the people. At the same time, the use of several scientific methods has been nurturing the soil.
There are two things in the lives of the farmers of this country, the feeling of devotion towards our soil and the scientific vision.
We all are proud of the fact that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and are also aware of modern sciences and they are used in agriculture.
I have heard about Tohu village, Bhoranj block and farmers of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
The farmers there used to use chemical fertilizers in an imbalanced manner so that the quality of soil was reduced.
Production was decreasing, it also reduced the income of the farmers and also reduced the production of soil.
Some aware farmers in the village knew the seriousness of the situation and followed by the farmers of the village tested their soil as they were advised to use fertilizers, nutrients and biological fertilizers.
You will be surprised to hear the consequences that the information provided to the farmers through soil health cards and the implementation of the guidance has shown positive results.
The production of wheat in Rabbi 2016-17 increased by three to four times and income increased by Rs. 4 to 6,000.
If we take care of the crop then we should take care of the soil and if we take care of the dam mother then they will also take care of them.
More than 10 crore farmers across the country have created soil health cards to get better information about their soil and to take crops accordingly.
We devote the damsel mother but have we considered how dangerous the fertilizers like urea are for the health of the damsel.
This has been proved by many scientific experiments that cause land loss due to urea more than required.
The farmers are the sons of this dam, how will they make their mother sick
It is the need of the hour to revive this relationship between mothers and sons.
Can our farmers resolve to use urea for our farming till the year 2022, that is, 75 years of our independence
Once the sons of the damed mothers and the farmers resolved that the dam will improve the health of the land and the production will also increase.
There will be a real change in the lives of the farmers.
We are now feeling that global temperature rise and change in the environment.
There was a time when cold started before Diwali.
Now December has come to the forefront and the cold begins very much.
We all have the experience of getting cold or getting out of the bed.
However, those who are aware in this season also work effectively and their examples inspire all of us.
However, the determination and resolve was greater and stronger than all.
The eight-year-old son was unable to speak, but he took the basis of Shitti.
Arising at 5 a.m. in the morning, the child was asked to go to the house in the village and not to open the toilet.
The efforts of this child to teach at least 30-40 households everyday have made this village open defecation free.
Every moment you get to learn something new.
Today they are performing well in every field.
Whether it is sports or competition or social initiative, our Divyangjans are not lagging behind in any case.
You must remember that in the Rio Olympic Games, our Divyang sportspersons had earned four medals in the best sportspersons and also won the World Cup of Tea-Twenty Cricket of the Blind.
Several types of competitions are going on across the country.
A few days ago, the 17th National Para Waterfall Competition was held in Udaipur.
80 percent of their body does not have muscles but look at their courage, commitment and hard work.
He also won a gold medal at the 70th National Para Water Sports Competition and was chosen by the Sports Authority of India for 20-20 Paralympics.
They are among the 32 Para waterfields and will be trained at the Centre of Excellence in Gujarat.
I salute the courage of Youth Jigar Thakkar and congratulate them.
A few days later, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
On this day the Prophet Hazrat Mohammad Saheb was born.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen and I hope that this festival of Eid will inspire all of you to enhance peace and harmony in the society.
Namaskar Prime Minister ji, I speak from Kanpur to Neeraj Singh.
I urge you to recall the best of the 10 things you have spoken through Mann Ki Baat every year so that we can recall them and we can learn something new.
We have made very good information.
After listening to your speeches, I feel like putting a lot more in it and changing it.
We often say that those old people in the village, they do not forget sadness, do not forget happiness.
I invite you to welcome 2018 in a pleasant environment, with good memories, with positive ideas.
Or share positive things on Narendra Modi App, on MyGov or on social media.
Emphasis the events that inspire others.
We will see the strength and impact of these joint efforts together.
I will definitely try to reach the next chapter of Mann Ki Baat on the Hashtag Positive India.
My dear countrymen, I will once again interact with you all for Mann Ki Baat in the next month.
There will be an opportunity to speak many things.
Thank you a lot
Chhath Parv, which is being celebrated six days after Deepawali, is one of the festivals celebrated with dedication in our country.
In which traditional rules were followed from food to garments.
The unparalleled festival of Chhathpuja is completely linked to the worship of nature and nature .
Sun and water are the centres of Chhath devotion, while bamboo and mud-made utensils and rocks are useful in the worship process.
The world worships Ugavati, but in Chhathpuja, it also gives us a version of worshipping them, whose quality is certain.
This festival also includes the importance of cleanliness in our lives.
Cleanliness of the entire house, along with rivers, ponds, shores, shores and pujasthanas, all the people are very enthusiastic.
Surya Vandana or Chhathpuja is the festival of Foreign Protection, Disease Redressal and Discipline.
Normally, it is a lack of food and inferior emotions.
But it is a special tradition of eating prasad after half of the morning.
This is the reason that the ego is destroyed by the food behind the prasad and the ego is a feeling that the person becomes a hindrance in the progress of the person.
It is very natural that people are proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that Mann Ki Baat has been constructed with the people of the country in hundreds of times.
Take examples of khadi and handloom.
I always appeal to Gandhi Jayanti for handloom, Khadi and you will be happy to know what is the result of it.
I would like to tell you that on 17th October this month, a record sale of Rs. 1 crore 20 lakh was recorded in the Khadi Gramodyog Bhawan store in Delhi on the day of Dhantrayodashi.
You must have been happy to hear that Khadi and Handloom will be sold at such a large scale from the same store.
During Deepawali, the sale of Khadi Gift Kupan has increased by about 680.
The sale of khadi handicrafts and handicrafts has also been seen to increase by about 90 this year as compared to last year.
Today, the youth, the elderly, the women, the people of every adult like Khadi and the handloom.
I can imagine how much the weaver families, the poor families and the families who have been working on this business would have benefited.
However, with the experience of the past few years, I can say that Khadi for Nation and Khadi for fashion have now replaced Khadi for transformation.
In the lives of the poorest of the Khadi poor, the handloom becomes a means of making them empowered and empowered by transforming the lives of the poorest of the poor.
This is a big role for the rural industry.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he would like to know about the experience of Deepawali with my security forces and how our security forces celebrate Diwali.
Mr. Tejas Gaikwad has also asked the Narendra Modi App to provide sweets to our security forces.
We also remember our brave security forces.
We want the sweets of our house to reach the soldiers of the country.
You must have celebrated Deepawali with great enthusiasm.
This Diwali has also taken a special experience for me.
I respect every soldier of the security forces, along with all the countrymen for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice of our security forces, who are fighting against the difficult and odd situation on the border.
When you get time, when you get time, you should know the experience of the soldiers, you should listen to their pride.
Many of you do not know that our soldiers are not only protecting our borders but also playing an important role in world peace.
Everyone is aware of the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace in the world and their positive role.
And we believe that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is my family.
With this belief, India has been active in various UN initiatives since the beginning.
You all know that the proposal for Indias constitution and the proposal for the UN Charter begins with words Wui the People.
India has always emphasized on women equality and the UN Declaration on human rights is a living example.
All Main R. Borne Free and Equal was transformed into the Indian representative Hansa Mehta's efforts and later acknowledged the 'All Human Bings R. Borne Free and Equal'.
If you look like this, this is a small change, but a strong idea was seen from it.
Indias role in UN Peacekeeping Operations is the vital contribution of India through UN Ambale.
More than eighteen thousand Indian security forces have served in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
In the situation, nearly seven thousand soldiers were connected to UN Peacekeeping and this is the third highest in the world.
By August 2017, Indian soldiers have served at least 50 operations in 71 Peacekeeping.
This was the endeavour of peace from some countries like Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan, 20,000 patients were treated at the Indian Army Hospital and they would save countless people.
The Indian security forces not only protected the people of different countries but also won the minds of those people.
Indian women have also played an important role in building peace.
India is the only country to send women police units to Liberia in the Peace Abhiyan Mission.
And this step of India has been an inspiration for the nations of the world.
After this, all the countries started sending their women police units.
We will be proud to hear that India's role is not only related to the peacekeeping mission but also training peacekeeping in 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha have conveyed the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peace Abhiyan, this is not an easy task.
Our security guards have to go to the remote areas.
His memory blossoms the honour of every countrymen.
He was the only UN Peacekeeper, a brave man who was awarded the Paramveer Chakra.
Lieutenant General Premchand ji made a special identity in Cyprus.
In 1989, in the 72nd year, he appointed him as the Force Commander for Operation and served him to ensure the freedom of that country.
General Thimayya, who was the Chief of the Indian Army, also led the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and bowed universal in peacekeeping.
As a peace ambassador, India has always conveyed the message of peace, unity and harmony.
We believe that everybody should lead the vision of a better, better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our homeland has been decorated with such great personalities who have served humanity without selflessness.
Sister Nivedita, whom we call brother-in-law Nivedita, is also one of these exceptional people.
Margaret Elizabeth Nobel was born in that Ireland, but Swami Vivekananda named him Nivedita.
Present means complete dedication.
Later, he worked in line with the name and proved himself.
Yesterday, Sister Nivedita was the 150th birth anniversary.
Swami Vivekananda's car was so impressed that he sacrificed his happiness and dedicated his life to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita was very distressed by the atrocities in the British rule.
The British not only slaughtered our country but also tried to make us slaughter mentally.
It has always been used to write less to our culture and create inferiority.
Brothers and sisters, Nivedita ji re-established the pride of Indian culture.
He worked to keep people together by awakening national consciousness.
He went to various countries around the world and raised a voice against anti-visionalism and philosophy.
Renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanian Bharti is famous for his revolutionary poet Pudumri Penna, New Women and women empowerment.
It was believed that his inspiration was brother-in-law Nivedita.
Brothers and sisters, Nivedita ji also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
Through our writings and summits, we have helped in research and propagation.
It is a beautiful feature of India that spirituality and science are helpful in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu are the best examples.
Hundreds of people lost their lives in Kolkata in 1899.
Sister Nivedita has started the work of cleaning the roads without taking care of her own health.
She was such a woman who could live a comfortable life but she was associated with the service of the poor.
People took inspiration from this sacrifice and helped them in their service.
He taught people cleanliness and service through their cars.
On his graveyard, he wrote, 'Hear Reposes City Nivedita Hu Geve Har All to India', the Citizens are resting, who gave us the whole of India.
Undoubtedly, this is what he has done.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all the children of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on his birth anniversary.
Children are the heroes of building a New India.
Earlier, it was our concern that the disease used to take place in adult age and the disease used to come in the last stage of life.
In the youth, such diseases used to be exceptional.
However, now our lifestyle has changed.
These diseases are now known as lifestyle disorder .
In young age such diseases are less physical activity and changes in dietary methods .
It is necessary that the society and the families should pay attention to this thing.
When we consider it, we will be aware that there is no need to speed up anything.
There is just a need to change the habits and change the habits of ours by regularizing small and big things.
Instead of going to the liftons of children make the habit of climbing the stairs .
After dinner, try to go with the entire family to walk with the children.
Yoga for Young India
This Yoga, especially our young friends, will be helpful in absorbing a lifestyle and preventing lifestyle disorders.
The specialty of Yoga for 30 minutes before school is that Yoga is easy and accessible.
And I would like to say that Yoga can easily be done by any person of any age.
It is easier to learn in such a way that it can be learned in such a way that it can be done in such a way as possible.
For this, there is no need for special resources and fields.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have received good news in the sports sector in the last few days.
Our sportspersons have brightened the country in various fields.
In Hockey, India won the Asia Cup Hockey Trophy while sportspersons.
Our sportspersons performed the best and on this strength, India became the Asia Cup Champion after 10 years.
Earlier, India was the Asia Cup Champion in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to this hockey team and all their teams and to the countrymen.
After Hockey, there is a luxury report in Badminton too.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikantan won the Denmark Open Trophy at the excellent sports and lauded the country's pride.
This is his third Super Series Premier Award after Indonesia Open and Australia Open.
Friends, this month the FIFA Under Seventin World Cup will be organized.
Many teams from all over the world came to India and showcased their skills on the football grounds.
I also got the opportunity to see a confrontation.
The sportspersons were very excited.
This great event of the World Cup, the whole world was watching you.
I was pleased to see such a great competition and the energy and enthusiasm of the young sportspersons.
The World Cup event was successful and all the teams performed the best.
Even though India did not get a glass, Indian sportspersons won the hearts of everyone.
This festival of all world sports including India enjoyed and the entire competition became thrilling and entertaining for football lovers.
Footballs are indicative of a bright future.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their cooperation and all the sports lovers.
My dear countrymen, I will have to do Mann Ki Baat everyday to justify the emotions of the people who have written on the subject of Swachh Bharat and to dedicate Mann Ki Baat only on the subject of cleanliness.
Some young children send photographs of their efforts and there is a story of the youth.
Somewhere there is a story of a new initiative about sanitation, but there is a news of the changes made by the enthusiasm of an officer.
A few days ago, I received a detailed report in which the legislation of the Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra is a story.
There was a Swachhta Abhiyan at Chandrapur Fort, an NGO named Ecological Protection Organization.
In this campaign that lasted for two hundred days, people did not stop or tired, they did the work of cleaning the fort with a confusion.
I am amazed to see the photographs and whoever sees this photo, whoever feels disappointed with the disappointment of the surrounding surrounding surrounding surrounding filth, I would like to tell the people that you can see the live image of the youth of the Ecological Protection Organization, their hard work, the hopes and their resolves.
Seeing this, the disappointment of ours will turn into confidence.
My dear countrymen, all of you will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on 4th November.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji is not the first Guru of the Sikhs but he is Jagadguru.
He thought of the welfare of the entire humanity and addressed all the castes.
He emphasized on women empowerment and women's honor.
Guru Nanak Dev ji travelled 28 thousand kilometers and taught the truth humanity during this journey.
He interacted with the people, showed the path of truth, sacrifice and duty.
The message of social equality was given and this teaching was not only shown by speaking but also by our cars.
He started anchor and created service to the people.
With the consumption of food together, the feeling of unity and equality of people was awakened.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji gave three messages of meaningful life - remember God, work, work and help in the need.
Guru Nanak Devji created Gurubani to tell his principles.
In the coming year, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Dev ji's 55th light year.
Let us try to move on the path of their messages and teachings.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ji.
You know that he had laid the foundation stone of an integral modern India.
Today we can learn a lot from the life of this great son of Mother India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's specialty is that he was not only a transformative idea but also a practical solution to the complex problems of achieving it.
He was an efficient expert in realisation of ideas.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel made India an investment point.
It has been ensured that millions of Indians can be brought under the shadow of a nation and a Constitution.
He empowered them to overcome all the difficulties in their decision-making.
He was honoured wherever we needed to honour.
He used the strength to be used wherever we needed to use.
They set a goal and with that goal, they were guided.
He was able to do the same thing to keep the country together.
He had dreamt of a nation where all the people would be equal.
I believe that the ideas of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel are always inspiring.
He said, "No difference between caste and creed can stop us, all are children and daughters of India, we should love the country and a future on mutual love and harmony.
These ideas of Sardar Saheb are still inspiring for our vision of New India.
And his birthday is celebrated as National Integration Day.
I urge all of you to participate in this festival of Run for Unity.
Friends, Dear countrymen, after Diwali holidays, with a new resolution, with a new decision, all of you have come into your daily life.
May my countrymen fulfil their dreams.
Thank you very much.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
Through All India Radio, Mann Ki Baat has completed three years.
Today, it is 36th.
Most of them are inspiring me.
Several things are going to improve the government.
There are also some personal complaints.
However, some collective questions are taken to focus and I take half an hour in a month but people send their messages to Mann Ki Baat on thirty days.
This has resulted in sensitivity in the government too.
It is easier to see the neglected capabilities of the society at all levels and that is why the journey of Mann Ki Baat for three years is an incoming journey of feelings and feelings of the countrymen.
Perhaps I have got the opportunity to understand the feelings of the common man of the country in such a short span of time and I am very grateful to the countrymen for this.
In Mann Ki Baat, I have always remembered one thing of Acharya Vinoba Bhave.
Acharya Vinoba always used to say that non-governmental, non-governmental monks would have resulted.
This thing has been kept away from the political color and at that time, instead of being a stable mind, has tried to connect and connect with you.
I am aware that after three years, social researchers, universities, researchers and media specialists will definitely analyze this.
And I believe that the thoughts made by such a belief will be more useful for Mann Ki Baat in the future.
I had once said in Mann Ki Baat that we need to worry about the need to take as much as possible, the food is being eaten.
After this, I saw a large number of letters from every corner of the country.
Many social organisations, many youngsters have already been working on this thing.
I was recalled that there are many people who have been working towards the way the food that is given in the furnace can be used together.
Once I saw this thing from a Sarpanch from Haryana, 'Selfie with Dotor' and I told all of them in Mann Ki Baat.
In view of this, a big campaign called 'Selfie with Dotor' was started not only in India but also in the entire world.
This is not just a matter of social media.
This was an event that made every girl a new self-confidence and a new pride.
A few days ago, I was discussing with the tourism department of the Government of India.
I told the people who visited outside that wherever you go to the topic of Incredible India, send photographs and photographs of lakhs of photographs.
It has come from every corner of India and in a way it is a big pilgrimage for those who work in the tourism sector.
I have experienced this 'Mann Ki Baat' that how big a movement can be created.
Today I was thinking about the start of Mann Ki Baat for three years and many events of the last three years have touched my heart.
Every moment we are thinking of going to the right path of the country.
I want to do something or the other for the benefit of every citizen of the country, for the good things of the society, for the progress of the country.
I have understood, learned and learned from the countrymen in this three-year Mann Ki Baat campaign.
I bow down to the countrymen with my heart.
I had once talked about Khadi in Mann Ki Baat and said that Khadi is not a textile but a thought.
I once again urge you to continue the Khadi campaign.
If we buy khadi then we should work with this feeling that the light of light will illuminate in the poor houses.
This work will empower the poor of our country and therefore we should do this thing.
How to bring new technologies, how to enhance productivity, how to handle solar energy
The old 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years have been closed and how it can be revived.
The Khadi Ashram of Sevapuri in Varanasi Sevapur in Uttar Pradesh had been closed for 26 years but now it has been revived.
Several organisations have been linked to it.
Many people have been provided new employment opportunities.
Once again our training centres closed by Khadi and Village Industries in Pampore in Kashmir and Kashmir has a lot to contribute in this area.
Now the resumption of this training centre will help in modernizing the new generation, involving garment and inclusion of new things and I am very happy to note that whenever they present a big corporate house, they have started giving Khadi goods recently.
People have also started giving khadi goods while visiting each other.
Cleanliness will connect the people.
Your Honble President started this work and the whole country was involved in it.
Be it the elderly, the men, the women, the city or Khedegaon, everybody has become a part of this cleanliness drive.
When I say, "Sankalp Se Siddhi", we all see how this Swachhta Abhiyan is moving towards a pledge-siddhi.
Everyone accepts this movement, collaborates and contributes to fulfilling this movement.
I express my gratitude to the respected President.
But at the same time, every section of the country has considered it as its own work.
I am happy to note that in the first four days, more than 75 lakh people have participated in more than 40 thousand programmes in the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign and I have seen that some people are constantly working and they will continue to work till now.
One thing is that we should do cleanliness somewhere, the other thing is that we should not be aware of cleanliness but if we want to create cleanliness then there is a need for a ideological movement.
There were many competitions along with the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign.
More than 2. 5 crore children participated in the essay competition on Swachhta.
Thousands of children took pictures.
Using our ideas, we took pictures on the topic of cleanliness.
Many people wrote poems and in these days, the pictures that have been sent by your child friends and small children are posted in the social media.
Whenever it comes to cleanliness, I never forget to thank the people of the media.
These people have taken this movement forward with a very good feeling.
They are also leading this cleanliness movement in their own way.
We can see how big the electronic media and printed media can serve the country in this Swachhta Hi Seva movement.
Recently, a few days ago, some of me had taken care of the 18-year-old youth of Srinagar, Bilal Dar.
No, there is nothing like this.
Bill Dar works as a cleanliness work for the last five-six years from the age of 12-13 years.
The largest lake in Asia is near Srinagar, the lake will clean the lake with plastics, polythenes, waste, waste and dirt.
Bill Dar is younger but it has become an inspiration for everyone who is interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar for this.
My dear countrymen, we should acknowledge that future history is born from the womb of history and whenever the subject of history comes out, it is very natural to remember the great men.
This month of October is a month to remember many of our great men.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, is the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan and Nanaji Deshmukh on October 11 and is the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay on September 25.
This is the birth centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayal ji.
What was one point of all these great men
Nanaji Deshmukh was immersed in the work of Gramodya, leaving his political life and when his centenary year is being celebrated today, it is very natural to respect the work of his village.
The former President of India, Shri Abdul Kalam ji, was speaking about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh during his interaction with the youngsters.
He used to mention Nanaji's work with great respect and he himself went to the villages to see the work of Nanaji.
Like Mahatma Gandhi, Deendayal Upadhyaya was speaking about the last person in the society.
Sardar Saheb had brought the whole country together.
Now we should run for unity and move forward.
We say very easily and naturally that the specialty of unity in diversity is.
We are proud of diversity but have we ever tried to experience this diversity
I once again want to tell my countrymen of India, especially to my younger generation that we are in a state of awareness.
There are summer holidays, Diwali days, there is a need to go out somewhere in our country.
People go out as a tourist and it is very natural .
But sometimes it feels a matter of concern that our people don't see our country, they don't know the diversity of the country.
You must go out of the country, I don't oppose it, but sometimes you should also see the places in our country.
When we look at Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, one thing again recalls that when they travelled to India, they had seen India and at the same time they had a new inspiration to live for this country and to sacrifice their lives for this country.
All these great men had made India a broader tour.
At the beginning of his work, he tried to understand and understand India.
In tourism, value addition will take place at a time when we do not go to Paramulukha as a child, go to a student and try to understand their lives.
In more than four and a half districts, I have got the opportunity to stay in the night and today, whenever I take over this great responsibility in India, I am very happy to see the illusion that I have done.
It doesn't take time.
I urge all of you to not only announce the unity in diversity in this vast India but also a share of our unparalleled power.
There are many types of food habits with us .
We keep eating a new substance everyday throughout our life but there are so many types that the first thing will not come again.
Now, this is a great strength of our tourism.
I am confident that even if you visit outside this time, you will be moving forward my first campaign.
You must send photographs on Hash Tag Incredible India.
If you meet the people of that place then send their photographs.
There is a thought in my mind that in order to promote tourism in India, there can be seven best tourist destinations in our state and every Indian should be aware of those seven special destinations in the state.
If possible, they should go to seven places.
Can we give some information about these places
Can we make this information available on the Narendra Modi app
Can we give this information on Hashtag Incredible India
If all the people of one state start giving good information then I would like to tell the government that the information that has been received should be discovered and the same thing has come from every state.
This means how can the tourist destinations be encouraged by the intent of the people
The Government of India will work on it.
Come, join me.
You can also become a big and important partner in promoting tourism in the country from October to March.
I invite you for that.
My dear countrymen, as a human being, many things touch my heart.
The waves rise in my mind.
Some things in my mind are immortalized.
In the end, I am a man like you.
The Indian Army has received two heroes in the form of Lieutenant Swati and Fund.
It is unusual that both freedom and funds were also martyred by the President who served Mother India.
We can imagine that if the world gets destroyed at such a young age then how will the situation be
However, when the martyrdom Colonel Santosh Mahadik's wife Swati Mahadik faced this difficult situation, he decided to stand firm and he was admitted to the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and spent his life to fulfil his dreams.
Likewise, Nidhi Dubey, her husband, Mukesh Dubey, was working as a hero in the Army and martyrdom for the motherland.
So, his wife Nidhi decided that we would be recruited in the army and they fulfilled their determination.
It is natural for every countrymen to feel respected about their mother-power and their brave personalities.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to these two sisters.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and the festival of Diwali has come a big opportunity for the youth of the country.
FIFA World Cup Competition is being held in our country under the 17th year.
I am confident that the announcement of football will be heard all around.
Every generation of age will have to be interested in football.
It would not be possible to say that in the fields of schools and colleges of India, their youngsters have not been seen playing.
Let's say that the whole world is coming to play on the land of India. Let us also make sports a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
It is the time of worship of Mother Durga.
How the whole atmosphere has been filled with sacred aroma .
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar.
On the one hand, when the whole country was celebrating festivals, on the other hand, when there is a news of violence from any part of India, it is natural to worry about the country. This is the country of Buddha and Gandhi.
There is a country of Sardar Patel who laid down his life for the unity of the country.
Our ancestors have accepted public life values and non-violence with equal respect.
We have been listening to Ahimsa Parmo Dharma since childhood.
I had also said since the Red Fort that violence will not be consumed in the name of faith, whether it is a communal faith or a faith in political ideals, whether it is a person's faith or a faith in tradition, there is no right to take the law in the name of faith.
I would like to assure the countrymen that the country will never tolerate and no government will be able to to tolerate those people or groups who are suppressing the law and violence.
Everyone has to bend in front of the law.
Thousands of years of cultural traditions have seen cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events, perhaps there should not be a single day in 365 days, which would have been without sana.
Now we must have seen that our festivals are following the nature cycle .
There is a direct relation with nature .
Most of our festivals are connected to the farmers.
So first of all, I would like to call you the best Dukkadam.
Yesterday the festival of Sanvatsari was celebrated in Jain society.
In Jain society Paryashan festival is celebrated in the Bhadramasa .
On the last day of the Paryasana festival is the day of Sanvatsari .
This is a unique tradition.
The day of the festival is a symbol of emotionalism, non-violence and friendship.
In a way it also goes to Kaksha-Vani Day and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other a miracle .
We have been listening to this discussion and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say - pardoning is the specialty of a strong man.
Shakespeare has written in his drama the significance of Kaksha Bhav in the Merchant of Venice, Marcy is two-four Blest, it blesset hem that gives and hem that talkes, both of them get the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated in every corner of the country with great joy.
When the subject comes to Ganesh Chaturthi then it is natural to speak on the public Ganesh festival.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi goes on for ten days.
This Mahasana is considered a symbol of unity, equality and purity.
My best wishes to all the nationmen on the occasion of Ganesh festival.
Recently, the festival of Onam was celebrated in Kerala.
One of the colorful festivals of India is the main festival of Kerala.
This festival is known for our social and cultural importance.
Nowadays these festivals are seen becoming the cause of attraction of tourism .
I will tell the countrymen like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or Durga Festival in Bengal has become the attraction of tourism in a way.
There is also an opportunity to attract our foreigners.
We have to consider what we can do in that direction.
In the series of these festivals, the festival of Id-ul-uha will be celebrated throughout the country on the occasion of Kanhi Day.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festivals are a symbol of faith and belief for us.
The festivals of our New India have to be a symbol of cleanliness.
Festivals have been associated with cleanliness in family life.
Preparation of festival means cleanliness is not a new thing for us.
But it needs to be a social nature.
Cleanliness should be an integral part of the festivals not just in the houses, in the entire village, in the entire city, in our states and in our states.
My dear countrymen, the interpretation of modernization is changing.
A big campaign called Eco Friendly Ganapati has been set up.
If you look at the YouTube then the children of every household are becoming Ganapati and they are being made Ganapati by bringing the soil.
Somebody is colouring the vegetables, somebody is pieces of paper.
Different kinds of experiments are being done in every family.
And it feels sorry when you know new experiments.
Three years ago, when the Swachhta Abhiyan was launched, it will be three years on 2nd October.
Its positive results are visible.
Toilet power has reached around 67 per cent from 39 per cent.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from defecation.
A few days ago, there was a severe flood in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives but when the water of the flood decreased then everywhere dirt was spread.
At present, at Dhanera in Banaskantha district of Gujarat, activists from Jamiaat Ulema-e-Hind cleaned 22 temples and 3 mosques affected by the Purana.
Everyone sweated himself, all the people came out.
The best example of unity for sanitation, inspiring examples of everybody, has been given by all the workers of Jamiaat Ulema-e-Hind.
And if it becomes our sustainable feeling, then our country will be able to go somewhere.
My dear countrymen, I appeal to all of you that once again, 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, the Swachhata Hi Seva used to say, "Jal Seva is the Lord Seva", "Swachhata Hi Seva".
Make an environment of cleanliness throughout the country.
Whenever we get the opportunity, we should find opportunities.
But we all come together.
Come together on the day of holiday or Sunday and work together .
Go to the nearby settlements but work with a movement.
I urge all the NGOs, schools, colleges, social, cultural political leaders, government officials, collectors and sarpanches to ensure that 15 days before Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October we should become an environment of cleanliness that the dream of Kharch Gandhi will be on 2nd October.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, MyGov.
A department has been built on the Inn where after construction of toilets, you can write your name and the name of the family which we have helped.
My social media friends can run a few constructive drives and actually work on the lines of the world.
This campaign is being organized by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation through Swachh Sankalpsy Competition, Small Film Making Competition, Picture Competition.
We can write essays in different languages and there is no bond of age.
You can make a short film with your mobile phone.
You can make a 2-3-minute film that will inspire cleanliness.
It can be in any language.
I invite everyone to connect with this cleanliness mission.
Once again I would like to tell you that you should resolve to celebrate the 2nd October of Gandhi Jayanti on the occasion of Swachhta 2nd October and so that you can reach the household of Swachhta Hi Seva from 15th September.
Some or the other steps have been taken for cleanliness.
Be a part of it by working yourself.
You see how Gandhi Jayanti will shine on 2nd October.
You can imagine that after this 15-day Swachhta Abhiyan, when Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated on 2nd October, we will be happy to pay homage to revered Bapu.
My dear countrymen, I would like to particularly accept my loans today.
I express my heartfelt gratitude and not because we have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for a long time and I would like to express my gratitude for this thing that millions of people are being linked to the country through Mann Ki Baat programme.
I have got the opportunity to understand the feelings of the people of the country.
I look forward to your message as much as you look forward to Mann Ki Baat.
I am eager because I get to learn something from all of you.
I express my gratitude to you for your contribution.
We are connecting our mobile phones and we become a part of such wrong habits.
Prime Minister ji, I speak of Aparna from Pune.
I would like to tell you about my friendship that I always tried to help the people but I was tired of seeing a habit of it.
Once I went to the shopping mall with him.
We don't pay anything at large, but we share with our hardworkers and disbelieve in them.
Do you not think that we always have a connection with the sellers, small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers and those who are supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supposed to be supplied to them.
Not only this, we tell you to pay less than two to five rupees and we are the ones who went to eat in a big hotel and they don't even see the bill.
There is no question of rupees for him. How much pain will his heart be.
He is poor and hence he had doubts about his honesty and had no difference in your life for two or five rupees but how much of this small habit would he have given him
Madam, I am grateful to you, you have given me a message by calling a phone call to your heart.
I am confident that my countrymen will also leave doing so to the poor.
My dear young friends, the whole country is celebrating 29th August as National Sports Day.
This is the birthday of Major Dhyanchand Ji, a great hockey sportsperson and hockey magician.
His contribution to Hockey is incomparable.
I would like to remember this thing so that I feel that the new generation of our country should be linked to sports.
Sports should be a part of our life.
If we are the young countries of the world then the youth of our country should be seen in the field of sports.
Sports means physical health, intellectual readiness, emotional co-existence.
I understand what more than that
Sports is a kind of herb that connects the heart.
Our younger generation should come forward in the field of sports. Today, in the age of computer, I would like to tell you that the sports sector is more important than the sports stations.
Play FIFA on computer but show something on the outskirts ground.
The joy of playing cricket in the open field is different from the computer cricket .
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out and you would ever come home.
Today the situation is such that when the children come home they watch games or cartoon films on the mobile while sitting in the corners then they have to ask the mother if you will ever go out.
This was a time when you used to say to the mother ' s child , this time has come to you that you will ever go out.
Our youngsters are happy to note that FIFA World Cup is being organised under the 17th year in October 6-28.
Today, when I was talking about sports, there was a touching event in the last week which I would like to tell the citizens.
I got the opportunity to meet a young girl in the Himalayas.
Sometimes 30-30 days spent in the water, these six daughters will be the first incident in the world in the waves of the sea.
Who will be an Indian who will not be proud of such girls
I salute the affection of these girls and I wish them to share this experience with all the countrymen.
I will also provide a different place for the benefit of the Narendra Modi App.
Because we must read their experience because it is a story of adventure, a story of adventure and I would be happy that these girls will be able to reach you, my best wishes and blessings.
My dear countrymen, we celebrate Teachers Day on 5th September.
It is the birthday of the former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji.
He was the President, but he was presenting himself as a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
It is an important feature of the teacher to enjoy creative emotions and knowledge among our students.
When we celebrate Teachers Day on this occasion, can we make a pledge together
Let us guide every five years to build it with a solemn pledge and let us enjoy the joy of fulfilment of our resolve and enjoy the success of our life in five years.
There is such an event in the life of every teacher that his efforts would have changed the life of someone.
If we make collective efforts then we can play a big role in the transformation of the nation.
I live in Mumbai for the Indian Research Centre of Harvard University.
Thank you.
My dear countrymen, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is a topic of economic inclusion not only in India but also in the entire world.
On August 28, 2014, this scheme was started with a dream in mind.
Tomorrow, this scheme is being completed for three years.
30 crore new families have been connected and bank accounts have been withdrawn.
Today I am happy that the poor people of the society have been made a part of the economy of the country.
Now there is an atmosphere of restraint.
He feels that the money will be used for the children.
Some good work can be done in the coming days.
Not only this, the poor who sees the RuPay card in their own field feels like a sweetheart.
He feels a commendable experience.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Rs. 65,000 crore is deposited in the bank.
This is their strength in the coming days and the insurance of the accounts opened under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has also been distributed.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana) is a big belief among the poor.
If something happens on the main basis of the family then the family will get Rs. 2 lakhs.
Today, it is not so much time that I will tell the people of the bank to upload to my gov.
My dear countrymen, once again you are very sad.
Thank you very much.
The mind of man is that during the rainy season he feels very charming .
Animals , birds , trees , nature and all are enjoyed by the arrival of rains .
However, this rain sometimes takes a variety of forms and then it feels that the power to destroy the water is also great.
Nature gives us life, nurtures us, but sometimes the terrible form of floods and earthquakes becomes devastating.
There is also a very negative impact of the changes that are happening in the changing weather and environment.
In the last few days, some parts of India, particularly Assam, North-Eastern states, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal are facing natural calamities due to heavy rains.
Flood affected areas are being fully monitored.
Whether it is the soldiers of the Indian Army, the people of the Air Force, the NDRF, the NDRF, the NDRF, all of them are bowing themselves to the services of the disaster affected people during this period.
Its impact is on agriculture, livestock, infrastructure, roads, electricity and connectivity.
People are also telling their problems.
Gradually, all of us can prepare timelines for our work according to the climate pattern, so that possible damage can be avoided.
When I prepare Mann Ki Baat, I can see the citizens of the country preparing it more than me.
On this occasion, a lot of letters have come to me on the topic of GST, a lot of phone calls have been received and people are still expressing happiness over GST and expressing satisfaction.
One of the phone calls in it also tells you: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I used to speak from Gurgaon to Neetu Garg.
I heard your Chartered Accountants Day speech and was very impressed.
Similarly, GST has started in our country on the same date of last month.
Whether the government had expected this decision or the results are being received after a month or not, can we tell you what
I would like to hear your thoughts about this.
GST has been implemented for about a month and its benefits have also been shown.
I am very happy that when a poor person writes a letter to me about how GST has reduced the prices of essential items of the poor and how cheap things have become.
Initially a person living in the far-flung mountains and forests of Ishaan writes a letter that the GST was not aware of the matter but now it seems as if it was easier to learn about it.
All these facilities are not only there but they are also getting support for economic pace.
The speed at which this change has been simplified, the speed at which it has been transformed, the new registration has created an atmosphere of confidence throughout the country.
In the field of economics, scholars in the field of management and scholars in the field of technologies, the use of India's GST is an ideal system, sometimes in front of the world.
This will be an example of a study for many universities in the world.
Because there has been such a big change in such a big way and it is a big jump of success to implement this tax in such a huge country with the participation of crores of people.
All the decisions have been taken by the States and the Centre together.
As a result, every government had prioritized that GST would not cause any excessive burden on the cost of food grains to the poor.
You are very well aware of what was the price of a goods before GST, what was the cost of a new situation, all the information is available on the GST app on mobile.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries, all the departments, all the workers of the central and state government for this work.
GST is an excellent example of the victory of Indias collective powers.
This is a new historic victory.
And this is not just a tax reform but a new honest culture.
In a way, it is also a campaign for social reform.
I once again salute crores of Indians for doing so smoothly.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is a month of revolution.
In a way, in the month of August, there have been several such events which are specially linked to the history of independence.
This year we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
However, very few people will be aware of the fact that uit India is a slogan Dr.
Yusuf Mehr Ali had given it.
We must know what happened on 9th August, 1942.
What could be a bigger inspiration than this
The uit India Movement was an important struggle in the Indian freedom struggle.
This movement had prepared the entire country to take a pledge to free the country from the British rule.
This was the time when the people of India, every corner of India, the villages, the cities, the educated, the uneducated, the poor, the wealthy, the people of India became a part of the uit India movement against the rule of the British.
In response to Mahatma Gandhi's appeal, millions of Indians were bowing their lives in the struggle with the mantra of 'Karo Ye Maro'.
Millions of youngsters of the country had left their education and books.
The great men like Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan played a key role.
Two different forms of Gandhiji are seen in both the Interest Movement and the uit India Movement - 1920 and 1942.
The shape of the 'Anti-Shakar Movement' was different and in 42 years such a situation came up, the intensity grew so much that a great man like Mahatma Gandhi gave the mantra of 'Koro Ye Die'.
Behind all these successes, there was mass support, peoples strength, peoples resolve and peoples struggle.
The whole country was fighting together.
Sometimes I feel that India's first freedom struggle was established in 1857.
This freedom struggle, which started from 1857, was launched every moment in some or the other part of the country till 1942.
This long-standing period awakened the spirit of freedom in the minds of the people.
Everyone was committed to do something or the other in that direction.
Generations have changed, but the resolution has not been moved.
The country was making every effort to reverse the rule of the British.
This was decisive for five years.
Now I want to connect you with this mathematics.
We became independent in 1947.
Today, the year 2017 is going on.
This incident took about 70 years.
During the time-bound governments have come up.
Arrangements have been made, changed, deaf and increased.
Everyone has tried their own way to free the country from problems.
Efforts have been made to ensure that there is employment in the country, to overcome poverty and to achieve development.
There was also a lot of hardship for them in their own way.
We've got success.
He added more than that.
Like 1942 to 1947, it was five years of resolution.
Similarly, I can see the five years of the journey of the resolution of 2017-2022 before you.
We should celebrate this 15th August, 2017 as a pledge festival and when we complete 75 years of independence in 2022, we should fulfill that pledge.
Today, the announcement of 'Karenge Marenge' is not to be linked to this resolution of a New India.
This resolution has to be resurrected and fought.
Come on, in the month of August 9 this year, we will run a campaign from the resolution to its achievements.
Every Indian, social organisations, local systems, schools, colleges, different organisations - let everyone make a new pledge for a New India.
One such resolution that we will prove in the next five years.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
We will be a part of this resolution festival and today we must be anywhere else or not online.
Therefore, I invite my young friends, especially in the online world, to come forward to contribute in their innovative way in the creation of a New India.
Using technologies, video, posts, blogs, articles and innovative ideas should be taken.
Give this campaign the form of a mass movement.
uit India uiz will also be started for young friends on the Narendra ModiApp.
This question on uit India is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I believe that you will propagate and propagate it at a wide range.
My dear countrymen, on 15th August, as the Prime Minister of the country, I get the opportunity to interact with the country from the Red Fort.
I am only on the occasion.
Definitely send your ideas on MyGov or on Narendra ModiApp.
I read it myself and I will try to convey this idea in the time I get on 15th August.
In the last three years, I have heard a complaint about my addresses on August 15 that my speech is very long.
I will complete it in more than 40-45-50 minutes.
There is a socio-economic in Indias economy.
And that economies will never be less written.
Our festivals are not just a matter of joy and excitement.
Our festivals are also the medium of social reform.
But at the same time, every festival has a direct connection with the economic life of the poorest of the poor.
In a few days, Rakshabandhan, Janmashtami, then Ganeshotsav, then the fourth moon, then Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja and Diwali will come one after another and this is the time when the poor get the opportunity to connect their economy.
And these festivals also mix a natural pleasure.
And if you want to talk about the economy then hundreds of families start protecting the country through small household industries several months before the festival of Raksha.
From Khadi to silk dragons, how many types of dragons are formed and nowadays people have started giving more preference to home-made guards.
Business of thousands and thousands of people is linked to the festival of Raksha Manufacturers, Raksha Manufacturers, Sweets and Sweets.
Its direct relation is with those poor families who have made small lamps of soil.
But today, while talking about the economy of the poor associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to issue environmental issues.
And he has urged me to talk about the eco-friendly Ganesh statue in the context of Ganesh Festival, so that people will be able to choose the statue of mud from now on.
I am grateful to these aware citizens for the first time.
He urged me to issue this topic beforehand.
This year's public Ganesh Festival has a special significance.
And I am sure that you all will be connected to this pledge when I tell you this thing a long time ago.
And this will provide employment to the poor artisans and poor artisans who have made this statue.
Let us all try to connect our festivals to the poor, to the economy of the poor, to enjoy the joy of our festivals as a festival of the economic benefit of the poor and to enjoy the joy of the economy of the poor.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the festivals and festivals.
Our countrymen feel proud and proud of these daughters.
Just a few days ago, our girls showcased their sports at the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those sportspersons this week.
It was very good to talk to him, but I realized that he did not win the World Cup.
This dragon was seen on their faces and its pressure was seen.
I told them a different analysis of me.
I said, "Look, nowadays there is a period of fame media that expectations are increased in it.
It is so much increased that when success is not achieved then the same aspirations change into vibrations.
We have seen many sports sportspersons in which if the sportsperson of India failed, the country's anger is expressed on those sportspersons.
Some people leave their limits and write such things which are very painful.
But this was the first time that our daughters did not win the World Cup, but even then 125 crore people of the country took the burden of defeat on their shoulders.
Indeed, the younger generation of our country, especially our daughters are doing a lot to brighten the name of the country.
Once again I congratulate the younger generation of the country, especially our daughters.
Every countryman should make a pledge and every countryman should formulate a pledge to prove that resolution in the next five years.
Come on, let us come together and move forward, let us do something or the other.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Weather is changing.
The summer was also very high this year.
However, the rainy season has fallen on time and the next move is simplified.
There is a pleasant atmosphere due to heavy rains in many parts of the country.
After the rains, heavy rains have resulted in relief from sunlight in the last few days.
And all of us have seen that however the pace in life, however the stress, the personal life, the public life, the arrival of rains changes our mindset.
Today the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm in many parts of the country.
Nowadays in some parts of the world, the festival of the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated.
The poor people of the country are associated with Lord Jagannath ji.
Those people who Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar has been taught, he must have seen that he would have praised Lord Jagannathji for his temples and his traditions as it contains social justice and social harmony.
The holy month of Ramzan was celebrated with a holy spirit of reverence.
Now there is a festival of Eid.
My best wishes to all on the eve of Eid-ul-Fitrah.
Ramzan month is a month to donate Pune.
It is a month to feel joy and as much joy as it feels.
Let us all come together and take the country forward by taking inspiration from these sacred festivals to the treasure of happiness.
In this holy month of Ramzan, an inspirational event of Mubarakpur village in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh came to me.
The families of nearly three and a half thousand Muslim brothers and sisters live in those small villages, in a way the population of brothers and sisters of our Muslim families is more there.
During this Ramadan period, the villagers have decided to build toilets together.
The government also provides assistance to the individual toilets and under this assistance, Rs. 17 lakhs were given to them.
You spend 17 lakh rupees for other facilities in the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for making this sacred day an opportunity for the welfare of the society.
One thing of them is very inspiring.
And most importantly, he made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
You know that three states of Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala have already been declared Open Defecation Free.
Uttarakhand and Haryana will also be declared Open Defecation Free this week.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration of these five states, to the government and to the people for completing this work.
And somewhere the body and the mind gets immersed.
This is the subject of cleanliness.
These bad habits have become a part of our nature.
They have become part of our habits.
We have to make regular efforts to get rid of this.
Everyone will have to pay attention.
The best inspirational events will be remembered again.
And I am glad that cleanliness has not been a government programme.
It is becoming a movement of the common man of the society.
And when the people sitting in the government also take this task forward with public participation then its strength increases manifold.
Recently, I remembered an excellent incident which I would like to tell you.
This incident is from Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The administration of that place has taken a big step in public participation.
100 hours of tireless campaign.
And what is the goal
Construction of toilets in 10,000 houses in 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that the people and the administration have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in 100 hours.
71 villages were defecated.
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of that village of Vijayanagaram district. They have presented an inspirational example with tireless hard work.
This awareness is commendable to the democracy of Prakash Tripathy.
And democracy is not only a system but it is also a culture.
Internal awareness is the price of freedom.
Regular awareness is essential for democracy and therefore we used to remember the attacks on democracy and move forward towards good democracies.
June 1975-25 was such a night, which would not be able to forget any democratic lover.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was transformed into tricks.
The opponent was pressed.
The dignitaries of the country, including Jaiprakash Narayan, were slapped in the turban.
The judiciary was also unable to escape from that terrible shadow of crisis.
The newspapers were being made completely unemployed.
Today's journalistship, the students of the world, the people working in democracy, are constantly making efforts to increase awareness towards democracy by remembering the black times.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in the courtyard at that time.
When Emergency was completed one year, Atal ji wrote a poem and he described the situation in his poem.
My dear countrymen, the dignity of every Indian has raised pride in the world today.
21st June, 2017 - the whole world is having Yoga.
From sea to mountains, people welcomed the sun rays in the morning and morning through yoga.
There is no Indian who is not proud of it.
It is not that earlier Yoga was not practiced but today, when Yoga was built in the threshold of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for connectivity to the world.
Most of the countries of the world have made this opportunity for Yoga.
The Great Wall of China in China, while people performed Yoga at a height of 2400 metres above the sea level at Machu-Pichhu global heritage site in Peru.
People practiced Yoga in the shadow of the IFAL tower in France.
In Afghanistan, in Herat, India-Afghan Friendship Dam (India-Afghan Friendship Dam) i. e.
Yoga categories were organized with Yoga Masters at UN Headquarters.
In Gujarat, about 55 thousand people from Ahmedabad have recorded a new world record by doing Yoga at the same time.
I also got the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
And for the first time, I was fortunate to do yoga in the rainy season.
Our soldiers also practiced Yoga in Siachen where there were 20, 25, 40 degrees temperature.
Be it our Armed Forces, Border Security Forces, ITBP, CRPF, everyone has made Yoga a share with their work.
On this Yoga Day, I used to say that three generations, because this is the third International Day of Yoga, so I was saying that three generations of the family should send me their photographs of Yoga together.
Some television channels have also taken up this issue.
I have received several photographs in this regard, some of them have been collected on the Narendra ModiApp.
A few days ago, I got the opportunity to visit my favorite programme.
In the last few years, P.
N.
A good programme is organised by the Panikar Statue and the month of reading is celebrated to make people aware of books and reading public books.
Now I also remember the things I had done with my attention.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had made a tradition in the government that we should not pay floral tributes, we should give a book or welcome to it.
The manufacturing of Khadi will also help in enhancing Khadi.
Whenever I was in Gujarat, I had become a habit of all of us but after coming here I used to feel that habit.
However, he went to Kerala and once again he became aware of the habit.
And now I have started informing the following people again in the government.
We can also gradually make the nature.
The lives of flowers used to be very low.
Once he took it in his hand and then kept it.
However, if the book was given then in a way it would become a part of the house and become a part of the family.
When I am talking about this, how historical were these things.
Last year when I went to England, the queen of Britain, Elizabeth, in London, invited me to eat.
How many years have been spent, but ueen Elizabeth has taken care of the money given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And when I went, I was delighted to show them to me.
And when I was watching, he was urging that I should touch it and see it.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became a part of his life and became a part of his history.
I am sure that these habits do not change in the ropeway and whenever they say this, they have to become rich in the vaccine.
However, we have to say such things, we have to make efforts.
Now I can't say where I went and whoever visits me, I will deny it.
My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are many kinds of work.
I have been involved in files but I have developed a habit for me that I read some of the letters that come to me everyday and I get the opportunity to connect with the common man.
Various types of letters are written and different types of persons are written.
Recently, I would like to read a letter and I would like to tell you about that.
Arulmozhi Sarvanan, a resident of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, a remote southern India, sent me a letter.
And what was the letter, he wrote that he had taken into account the education of children in his family and thought of taking some economic initiatives so that the family could get some financial assistance.
I took money from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started working towards supplying some goods from the market.
Some people asked me, I have registered it myself. I would like to tell the people of the country that you should also get such an opportunity.
To visit GeM, there is a new kind of arrangement.
Those who want to supply goods to the government, they want to sell trees, sell chairs, send tables, they can register their names on it.
Those people who register under EEGM, they see all the departments of the government.
Many things get cheaper due to lack of agents .
The Arulmozhi Madamany has registered all the goods that can be supplied on this website of the Government.
And the letters he wrote to me are very interesting.
He has written that either he got the money under the Mudra Yojana, his business started, I wrote the list of what I can pay on the e-GEM and I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office.
It was a new news for me that what would be the demand of the Prime Minister's Office
This is the opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
If Arunmozhi did not write me a letter, I would not have noticed that a housing slaughter in the e-GEM system can be bought from the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the strength of the country.
It also has transparency, empowerment and entrepreneurship.
Government e-Market-GeM
I want those who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way, to connect themselves more and more.
I believe that Minimum Government and Maximum Administration are the best examples and what is the goal of this thing - Minimum Price and Maximum Ease, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga, on the other hand we can also be proud of our success in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the ground for yoga then our dreams are also going to cross the horizons of the sky.
A few days ago, India has done a lot in the field of sports and science.
Today, India is not only flying on the ground but also in space.
Two days ago, ISRO launched 30 Small Satellite Satellites including Cartosaat-2 Malicate.
In addition to India, the satellites included about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States.
And this Small Satellite Campaign of India will help in the field of agriculture and natural calamities.
A few days ago, you all will remember that ISRO had successfully launched the GSAT-19.
And the satellites launched by India so far were the most weighing satellites.
And the newspapers of our country had compared it to the weight of the elephant.
So you can imagine how much our scientists have done in the space sector.
On 19th June the Mangal campaign completed 1 thousand days .
You all know that when we successfully got a place in the field for the Mangal mission, this entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
If photographs are being sent, information is being provided, scientific information is being received, then it is working for more time than the prescribed life.
It is important for our scientific journey to complete one thousand days.
At present, we are also looking at the sports sector that our youngsters are doing well.
Recently, India's badminton Kidambi Srikanth has won the Indonesia Open Competition and enhanced the country's pride.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to them and their teachers for this victory.
A few days ago, I am running P.
T.
Usha had the opportunity to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the Synthetic Track of the Usha School of Athletics.
The more we encourage sports, the more sports emotions we will also come together.
Sports play an important role in personality development.
The importance of sports is universal individuality development.
There is no shortage of talented players in the country.
If the children of your family are interested in sports then they should be given an opportunity.
They should not be encouraged to study by lifting them from the field and shutting them in the room .
If they can do their studies, they can show them shining performances, but if they have their own personality and interest in sports then the school, colleges, the family and the surrounding people should encourage them and encourage them.
Everyone has to dream for the next Olympics.
It is difficult to forget the heat of this year.
However, there is await of rain.
Today, the sacred month of Ramzan has started while I am telling you this.
On the auspicious occasion of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and the world, especially the Muslim community, on this holy month.
Prayer, spirituality and Dandharam are given great importance in Ramzan.
We are very fortunate that our ancestors have made such traditions and today India can proud of this thing, we can proudly proudly proudly proud that all the sects of the world are in India.
This is a country where there are people who believe in God and people who deny God.
There are also people who worship the idol and are also those who oppose the idol worship.
Every kind of ideas, every kind of worshipping system, every kind of tradition is here and we have adopted the art of living with each other.
And in the end, religion, sect, ideologies or traditions give us the same message - peace, unity and harmony.
This sacred month of Ramzan will definitely help in carrying forward this path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I congratulate everyone.
I am very happy to say that many people have responded to it.
Individual form, everyone showed me the zeal of telling me something about you.
Everything I have not read, the message of everyone has not been heard, so many things have come.
However, some people have tried to learn music, some people try to put their hands on new words, some people are trying to learn new things by using youth and learn new languages.
Some people are learning Pakkala, some are learning dance and some are learning drama.
Some people have written that we have started writing poems now.
Some people are trying to understand nature and live with nature.
I am very happy to note that I would like to hear you a phone call.
"I speak Diksha Katiyal.
When I had to read about the freedom struggle, I felt that how many struggles have to be fought for India's independence, how many sacrifices have been made, how many freedom fighters have spent years in the battle.
I was very inspired by those who had achieved a lot at a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to give some messages to the new generation about this.
I am glad that the younger generation is keen to know about our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men spent their lives in the clutches of freedom and many youngsters climbed the clutches of Fashi.
And that is why today we breathe in an independent India.
You must have seen one thing that those great men who have worked for writing, studying the times in the freedom movement and their writings also strengthened India's freedom.
I had visited Andaman Nicobar a few years ago.
The cellular jail there was also gone to see.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar wrote the book 'My Birth Anthem' in Turunga.
He used to write poems and write on the walls.
They were closed in a small ladder.
What kind of torture will be solved by those who took the lead of freedom.
When I read Savarkar's book 'My Janmathep', I was inspired to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a sound light programme which is very inspiring.
There will be no such state in India, there will be no single language group in India in which no one has spent his life in the cellular court of Andaman for the freedom of black money.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say many times - one must carry out a world one will not see.
It is our duty to worry about the world that we don't have to see.
If you are very suppressed then open the windows of the room, open the door, breathe in the fresh air, you get a new curiosity.
When contact with the five great personalities that our body was formed, a new consciousness was created in our body, a new energy emerged.
We all have experienced this, but we never take care of it, we do not build it in a threshold or in a threshold.
You must see that whenever you contact our natural situation, you will have a new consciousness within you.
And therefore, the global mission to connect with the nature of June 5 should become our own mission.
We are getting some benefit from our ancestors protecting the environment.
Now if we protect the environment, then the next generation will benefit from it.
And if Atharvaveda is an economy then it is the biggest guidance book of the environment and it was written thousands of years ago.
It was said to us that Mother Bhumi: Son Ahm Prithvia.
It is said in Vedas that the purity that we have in ourselves is due to the earth.
The earth is our mother and we are her sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, one thing is clearly visible that the three events of the birth of Mahatma Buddha, the gain of his knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana were done under the tree.
But in modern words, it needs to be associated with modern elements.
Through Yoga, we have linked the world to a formula.
Just as Yoga connects body, mind, mind and soul, it is bringing together today.
Today's lifestyle has made it difficult to live a stress-free life because of running and increasing responsibilities.
It has been seen that this stressful state of mind has been implanted since a very young age.
In such a situation, Yoga plays an important role in leading a stress-free life.
Yoga is the path of surety to achieve health and stability.
Yoga is not just exercise.
If you want to travel an interval with the health of the body and mind, then it is possible through yoga.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders from all over the world.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to Yoga and some Bakshis.
Gradually work will go ahead in that direction.
I have received an information and congratulations to the Secretaries of this valuable idea.
There is a lot of psychological information.
He said that this is the third International Day of Yoga this year and on this occasion, you should urge three generations of the family to do yoga together.
Azi-Azoba, mother-in-law, daughter-in-law and all the three generations should do yoga together and upload their photographs.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow will be such a beautiful meeting that will give Yoga a new dimension.
I am grateful for suggesting this idea and I also feel that just as we had launched the Selfie with Daughter campaign and had got a very interesting experience, the photographs of Yoga in three generations together will be appreciated in the country and in the world.
Where three generations are doing yoga, you must send a collective picture of the three generations of those people on the Narendra ModiApp and MyGov.
Tomorrow, there will be photographs of today and tomorrow, which will ensure a golden future.
I invite you.
International Day of Yoga is still about three weeks.
In a way it is a movement for immunity health care .
I invite you all to participate in this.
When you gave me the responsibility of your chief servant, when I had the opportunity to speak for the first time from the Red Fort on the first 15th of my tenure, I had spoken about cleanliness.
Since then, I have noticed that my journey is going on from different parts of India and what Modi is doing, what Modi is going on and what he has done is keeping an eye on.
This is the reason why I had a very careful phone call and I would have thought about what he said.
But I am grateful to them for bringing this in mind.
You also listen to this phone.
Namaskar Modi ji, I am speaking Naina from Mumbai.
On Modi ji television and social media I often see a lot of emphasis on cleanliness wherever you go.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, as per your request, people have collectively taken Swachhta as a mission.
Big people are not only involved in this but also awareness about cleanliness has been made in children.
Small children are often seen preventing elderly people from dirty roads .
The Swachhta Abhiyan that you had started from the valleys of Kashi has taken the form of a movement by your inspiration.
You are true to say that wherever I go, the government system works as a cleanliness, but recently in the society, the festival of cleanliness is being celebrated.
Five days before I reached there, seven days ago, a large number of sanitation programmes were taken up ten days ago.
Just a few days ago, I had visited Kutch in Gujarat.
There is a huge cleanliness drive.
But I didn't know the relationship between these two things.
However, after the telephone came, I thought that it was true.
You can imagine how much pleasure I have been to remember this thing and the country too is taking care of these things in such a way.
What else would be a matter of great pleasure for me than that cleanliness is linked to my visit
There is a habit of preparing the rest of the Prime Minister's reception but cleanliness has become an important thing in it.
This thing is pleasant and inspiring for anyone who loves cleanliness.
Imagine it is very good, but I have to consider it.
However, it is true that this movement should stand up and instead of giving a visit to some items and memories, it is a good thing to get an Amuk tonne of garbage discharged from the Swachhta Mission.
How big humanity will work.
Once we started considering this waste as wealthy, many new ways of waste management will come in front of us.
Youth connected with Start-ups will also come up with new schemes and will bring new tools.
The Government of India has decided to open a massive drive for waste management with the help of the governments in the states and with the help of the people's representatives of the cities.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, around 4,000 cities will be providing solid waste and liquid waste tools.
Two types of garbage will be provided, one of them is green and the other is blue.
Two types of wastes are being produced - one wet waste and the other dry waste.
These wastes will be kept in four thousand cities and wet waste should be kept in blue waste and green waste.
For instance, the garbage that comes out of the kitchen, the vegetables, the fried food, the egg cup, the palanquin, it is all wet waste and it should be put in the garbage of green color.
The other type of waste contains trash papers, pots, iron, glass, clothing, plastic, polythene, broken dungs, rubber and metals.
I am sure that we will develop a culture and we will be able to fulfil the dream of cleanliness that Gandhiji had seen.
Today, I have to mention one thing with pride that even if a person has determined his mind, he can create a mass movement.
Cleanliness is such a thing.
Citizens suffered for about 80-90 weeks and transformed Versova sea shores and thousands of tonnes of waste was sold and then Versova Beach became clean and beautiful today.
Versova Residency Volunteer (VRV) had taken up the entire responsibility of this work.
Brothers and sisters, Today I am happy to tell you one more thing and I was told that under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Riyasi Block part of Jammu and Kashmir has become Open Defecation Free.
I congratulate all the citizens of the Riyasi Block, the administrators there and Jammu and Kashmir for giving an excellent example.
And I have also been told that the leaders of this entire movement were women living in that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He took out a torch morcha for awakening the experience and went from homes and streets and inspired the people.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to those mothers and sisters, and congratulate the administrators there who have started the best by making a block on the land of Jammu and Kashmir free of open defecation.
My dear countrymen, from the newspapers, from the TV channels, from the social media, the present government's 3-year performance has been accounted for.
I see this process as a very positive sign.
The tenure of these three years has been defined on every criteria.
The people of every group of society have analyzed it.
Somewhere in it, somebody has given support, some errors have been registered and I believe that all these things are important.
I am also grateful to those who have given critical and critical responses.
If there is light on errors and deficiencies then there is an opportunity to improve it.
This circulation is very important for a aware nation.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and a good website has the same effect on me as it will be on the minds of a common man.
It feels as if I am sitting in the house and sitting in the family and interesting in the things of the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have written this thing to me.
I am grateful to Akbar Saheb.
My dear countrymen, when you meet again, every corner of the country has rained, the weather has changed, the results of the examinations have come, the new students will start living and the arrival of rains will come with a new joy and a new smell.
Let us all go ahead with love for nature in such an environment.
My best wishes to you all.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
Like a seeker, there is also a portion of such problems that the innumerable contribution of the people associated with the society and the government should not be seen on the other hand.
Every time the information that comes for Mann Ki Baat was detailed in the government.
What is the kind of information, what are the complaints, what are the experiences of the people
Normally it has been found that the nature of man is to give advice to others.
If someone gets cough in the railways, buses and someone gets cough then he will come and tell you to do so immediately.
Advising, informing, it is as if something is in our nature.
Most of the information providers are those people who are trying to reach me, who actually do something or the other in their lives.
They are trying according to their intellect, power, power and circumstances to make something better and when it comes to mind, I felt that this is not a common information, it is a matter of experience.
Some people do information for this also because they feel that if the ideas and ideas that others hear and get a comprehensive form then many people can benefit.
And therefore, they have a natural desire to mention it in Mann Ki Baat and all these things are very positive for me.
First of all, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the workers and those who do something or the other for the society.
Not only this, whenever I mention something, I feel very happy to remember something like this.
In the past, some people had informed me about Mann Ki Baat and I had mentioned it.
And after that, on the Narendra Modi App, many people from every corner of the country used innovative ideas to avoid food.
I have never thought of it, today our country, especially the younger generation, has been working for several years.
We have heard that some social institutions have been doing it for the past few years but the youth of my country are participating in this work.
Many have sent me a video.
There are many places where the banking of poles is going on.
In these poultry banks, people deposit their poultry, vegetables and take the needy people from there.
Those who give satisfaction also gets satisfaction and those who do not even feel humiliated.
This is an example of how work is done with the help of the society.
Today is the end of the month of April.
On 1st May, the States of Gujarat and Maharashtra will be established.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
The two states have been constantly trying to embrace the new heights of development.
We have contributed to the progress of the country and in the two states their lives in every field of the integral wealth of the great men and in the memory of these great men, we should resolve to take our state, our country, our society, our cities and our families to the establishment of the state in 2022.
We should plan to take that resolution and move forward with the participation of all the citizens.
Nature has also changed all the rules of sports.
The heat in our country in May-June has been driven to experience this year in March-April.
And when I was informing people about Mann Ki Baat, people have informed me about what to do in the days of summer.
S.
Many such friends of Kartik have expressed concern over the birds .
He has said that in Varanasi, water should be kept on the glasses and I have seen that small children in the family do this thing fondly.
Once they knew why they used to fill the water that they used to look at the utensils which were kept ten times a day, whether they had water or not and they keep watching whether the birds had come or not.
You feel that this is his sports, but indeed it is a wonderful experience of awakening this sensitivity in the minds of small children.
Sometimes you also see a little bit of animals and birds makes you feel a new joy .
A few days ago, Mr. Jagat Bhai has sent a book from Gujarat, Save the Sparrows and expressed concern about the number of chimneys being reduced in it. However, he himself has done a very simple description of what he used to do for his protection as a campaign.
However, in our country, animals and birds, nature are coloured with them, but it is necessary that such efforts should be strengthened collectively.
When I was the Chief Minister in Gujarat, the Dharmaguru Sayedna Saheb of Daudi Bohra Samaj had completed 100 years.
He lived 103 years.
And on his centenary, the Bohra community had launched a very big campaign to save the symptoms through the Burhani prestige.
I had got the opportunity to inaugurate it.
He distributed about 52,000 Bird Feeders to every corner of the world.
He has got a place in the Guinness Book of Global Records.
Sometimes we are so busy, we are so busy, we are so busy, we are suppliers of our homes, we forget that there are days of summer, if they want water.
Young friends, along with you too, I have to slaughter something.
I sometimes remember that many of our younger generations enjoy living a comfortable life.
Mothers and sisters also serve them in a rescue situation.
Some others are of the other end but most of the comfortable conditions are visible.
Now the examinations have been completed and plans for enjoyment of holidays have been made.
It feels very good even though summer holidays are hot.
However, I want to talk about how to leave you as a friend.
I am sure some people will definitely use and tell me.
If you use this vacation, I offer three of these proposals, then it is a good thing but try to do one of the three.
New space, new experience, new skills.
Sometimes seeing something on TV or reading in books or listening to it by acquaintances and feeling that thing on its own , there is a difference between land and respect .
Experiments should be positive, comfortable, comfortable.
We are from the middle class families and are from the happy families.
Sometimes feel that I don't say this again, do it once.
Taddan goes to the poor town with evening time, with your football, with a volleyball or with any sports literature.
You will be able to play yourself with those poor children. You will be able to see that sports has never been enjoyed before.
Whenever you get the opportunity to play with your children who live in such a way of life, you have ever thought how big change will happen in their lives.
And I am sure that once you go, you will feel like going again and again.
This experience will teach you a lot.
Several voluntary organisations are working serving.
Sometimes there are very summer camps .
Personality is of development, of various kinds of development and can be participated in it.
However, at the same time you feel that you have done such a summer, have done a course of personality development and you should reach those people who have not got such an opportunity and teach those who have learnt.
You can teach them how to do.
I was also worried about the fact that technology has come to reduce the gap and come to end the boundaries of technology.
Everyone has been busy with technology.
Today is the era of competition.
Friends, The dream of becoming a lot in life is a good thing and the idea of doing something is a good thing and it should also be done.
However, it is also seen that the human beings inside us do not worry or we do not go away from human qualities.
Whether these aspects can be focused on skill development.
Efforts to spend time with yourself away from technology.
Whether it is Tamil, Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi or Tamil or Tamil or Tamil or Tamil or Tamil.
If we see how many diversity and diversity we can find somebody educating around us.
If you are not able to swim then learn swimming , draw pictures , there is no good picture but try to put something on paper .
You will have to express the sensitivity inside you.
Sometimes we used to learn small things that we used to say - whether we want or not.
You see all these new experiments, these skills will also give you happiness and you will get out of what life has been built in a framework.
Do something outside Chakori, friends.
This is the opportunity to make life.
And you are thinking that if all the tests are over, when he learns on the new twist of a carcass then the opportunity will not come.
And that is why I tell you that if you want to learn magic then learn the magic of the leaves.
Keep on showing magic to your friends and friends.
Try to know some or the other things you don't know, it will definitely benefit you.
The human power inside you will get consciousness and there will be great opportunities for development.
I say with my experience that we cannot imagine what we can learn to see in the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages, new campuses.
After going to one place for three days and four days.
Then go to another place, stay there for three days and four days.
This will help you learn a lot.
When you go, surely send me a photo there.
Have you seen new
Where are you going
You can share your experience using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, At this time the Government of India has also given you a great opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from cash transactions.
You can also earn from this scheme but you have thought of it.
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
If you are downloading BHIM App, you are also using it.
10 rupees will be deposited by the government in your account.
If you do it by 20 people in a day then you can earn 200 rupees till evening.
Vocationals can also earn and students can earn.
And this scheme is till 14th October.
You will contribute to the creation of Digital India.
He was a symbol of VIP culture in a way, but the experience used to indicate that the red lights used to be used on the vehicle, the car used to be used but gradually he used to move into the head and the VIP culture in his head was deep.
Now there is only a red light that nobody can claim that the red light that has been rolled in the head has come out.
I have a very interesting phone call.
He has also expressed patience in this telephone but this telephone shows that the common man does not like this thing.
He feels a kind of inferiority in it.
Namaskar Prime Minister, I speak Shiva Choubey from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.
I was very proud to hear the evergreen Indian or a VIP on a road written in the newspaper and I am also happy that today my time is equally important.
I don't want to stop the traffic and I don't want to stay for anyone.
Therefore, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for this decision.
Going to Red Divya through government decisions is a part of the system.
However, we have to try to remove it from our mind.
If we all work together to make aware, then we can be removed.
Your concept of New India is to increase the importance of EPI instead of VIP in the country and when I say EPI instead of VIP, my feeling is clear.
Every individual has the importance, every individual has the importance.
If we accept the importance of 125 crore countrymen, if we accept the importance of 125 crore countrymen then how big power will be united to fulfil the great dreams.
We all have to do it together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that we recall history, our culture, our traditions.
It gives us energy, inspiration.
This year, we are celebrating one thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya, 125 crore countrymen.
Because of some or the other reason, we were so hampered and so small that we kept thinking for centuries.
For other countries around the world, the centuries will be of great importance.
However, India is such an ancient country that we have got the opportunity to commemorate thousands of years and thousands of years old societies.
Just imagine.
Even today, how many problems can be solved by the social system.
How will it happen a thousand years ago
He himself had done his life to those who were untouched by his conduct.
Thousands of years ago, he had campaigned for the entry of his temple and had successfully entered the temple.
We are so fortunate that in every era, great men have been born from our society to finish the evil activities of our society.
While celebrating one thousandth birth anniversary of Saint Ramanujacharya Ji, we should inspire him to awaken this spirit of social integration and organization.
The Government of India will also release a postage stamp on 1st May to commemorate Saint Ramanujacharya.
I salute Saint Ramanujacharya ji with respect and pay homage.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow has another significance.
He is also celebrated as Labour Day in many parts of the world.
And when the topic of Labour Day comes out, labour was discussed and workers were discussed then it is natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar.
And very few people knew that we are grateful to Baba Saheb for the discount that has been given to the workers today.
Babasahebs contribution to the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb, Saint Ramanujacharya ji, I remember the great saints and social reformers of Karnataka of the 12th century, Guru Basweshwar ji.
Yesterday, I got the opportunity to visit a function.
It was a programme to dedicate a collection of his promises to the nation.
In the Kannada language, he said, "What Kailas" means that you can achieve the Kailash of Lord Shankar's house with your hard work, that is, by doing the work, heaven is achieved.
In other words, labour is Shiva.
I have been talking about Sharma Jayate again and again.
Today, when I talk about the workers, then it is very natural to remember Thangdi after the time.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddha Purnima.
People associated with Lord Buddha celebrate festivals all over the world.
The problems faced by the world today, violence, war, destruction, weapons competition, the ideas of Buddha are very relevant.
And in India, the life of Ashoka is an excellent symbol of the journey from the war to Buddha.
I am fortunate that Vesak Day is celebrated by the United Nations on this great occasion of Buddha Purnima.
This year it will be celebrated in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will get an opportunity to pay homage to Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka.
He will get an opportunity to illuminate his memories.
My dear countrymen, India has always tried to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
And when we call 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' then it is not only in India but also in the global context.
Several projects are underway.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May.
The capacity and related facilities of the satellite will be very helpful in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
This is an excellent example of our commitment to South Asia.
In most parts of the country, many families will be busy in testing their children.
Those who have been tested, there will be a little stress-free environment and those whose examinations are still going on, there will be little stress in those houses.
But at this time, I will say that in the last few years, listen to what I had told the students from Mann Ki Baat.
These things will definitely be useful for us during the examination.
Today is 26th March.
March 26 is the Independence Day of Bangladesh.
A historic fight against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of the Bengali brothers.
On this important day, I convey my best wishes to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on the occasion of Independence Day and wish that Bangladesh should be progressive, developmental, I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a supportive partner of Bangladesh.
It is a good friend and we will continue to participate in peace, security and development in this entire department by shoulder to shoulder.
We all are proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memory is our shared heritage.
This national song of Bangladesh is also the construction of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that he was not the first Asian person to win the Nobel Prize in 1913, but the British had given him the Nighthood.
In 1919, when the British killed the citizens in large numbers in Jallianwala Bagh, Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who raised their voice against this incident.
This was the period when this incident had a unique effect on the minds of a 12-year-old child.
In the adolescent age, those children laughing in the fields and gardens who laughed in the fields and the dancers of Jallianwala Bagh gave a new inspiration to life.
In 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagat, the son of all of you, the inspiration of all of you, the martyr Bhagtasingh.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, the British had climbed Bhagat Singh ji, his colleague Sukhdev and Rajguru to Phasa and we all know about the incident on 23rd March.
On the faces of Bhagtasingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, the service of Mother India was satisfactory and there was no fear of death.
He had sacrificed the good dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
These three heroes are still an inspiration for us.
The saga of the sacrifices of Bhagtasingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru will be decorated incomplete.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit that place and I had experienced that there are special hypnotises in that land and I would like to tell the youth of the country that whenever I get the opportunity to visit Punjab, we must visit the graveyard of Bhagtasingh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagtasingh and Batukeshwar Datta.
This was the time when the hope of independence and its intensity continued to grow.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagtasingh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had inspired the youth for the Armed Revolution.
So, just a hundred years ago, Mahatma Gandhi had performed Champaran Satyagraha on 10th April, 1917.
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the Indian freedom struggle, Gandhiji's thoughts and Gandhi style were visible during the Champaran Satyagraha.
It was an important turn in the entire journey of freedom struggle, particularly from the point of view of struggle.
This was the time when Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, the end of the mill workers of Ahmedabad and the thoughts and style of Mahatma Gandhi were deeply affected.
In 1915 Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and gave a new inspiration to the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the statue of Gandhiji in our minds.
Imagine a person returns to India in 1915 and only two years of tenure.
The country didn't know them, they didn't have any influence.
We can imagine how hard they had to suffer and how hard they had to do.
Champaran Satyagraha was such an event in which Mahatma Gandhi's organisational skills, the power to recognize the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, the poorest of the poor, the poorest of the uneducated persons against the British rule, inspires and bring them to the ground for fighting.
We could learn this from him and that time was the time when Gandhiji, Rajendra Babu and Acharya Kripalani had sent all the big leaders to Kheda.
And the British could not know what was the method of Gandhiji's work, the struggle was also happening and the new construction was also happening.
There was a conflict and another creation.
On the one hand, the penalties used to bow themselves in constructive work.
This is the vision of transforming the people of 125 crore countries and the laying of the foundation stone of a New India.
New India is not a government programme or is not a declaration of any political party.
New India is an appeal to 1. 25 billion Indians.
There are many people who often go to the hospital, serve patients and many people who run for blood as soon as they need.
Many people worry about the stomach of the hungry people .
Our country is a multi-lateral spring.
Public service is also linked to our nerves.
If we look at it as a collective, organised, then it is a great power.
If every citizen pledges that I will follow the rules of transportation, if every citizen decides that my responsibilities will be fulfilled honestly, if every citizen decides that one day in a week I will not use petrol and diesel, it will be small to see.
You will see that the dream of this country, the dream of a New India, the 125 crore people are watching it will be fulfilled in front of you.
It means that every citizen should follow the duties of his citizens.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude today.
In the last few days, an atmosphere has been created in our country that people have been involved in digital payments and digital movements.
After demonetization, there has been an increase in various types of digital payments.
The BHIM App has been started only for two-and-a-half months but about 1. 5 crore people have downloaded it so far.
My dear countrymen, we have to fight against black money and corruption.
25 billion Indians will make a pledge to transform 2.
We have announced in the budget.
If they take this work on their minds for 125 crore Indians then there is no need to wait for one year.
This work will be done in six months.
2. 5,000 crore digital transactions, if we pay fees in the school, do not fill the cash, do not fill the cash in the digital way and do digital payments in the journey of the train.
We can do this in everyday life.
In the last few days, several digital fairs were organized for public education and public awareness.
There is a resolution of 100 programmes across the country.
80-85 programmes have been conducted.
There was also a fortnight plan in it.
About 1. 5 lakh people have got luck in the fortunate consumer scheme.
Seventy thousand businessmen have obtained the axis for them .
Finally, a big event will be held on the occasion of the completion of 100 days.
There is an arrangement for big leaves.
I am confident that we will propagate Bhima App in the number of days that Babasaheb Ambedkar is in his hands for his birth anniversary.
Let us participate in how cash can be used less and how to reduce the use of notes.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to say that whenever I ask the people for Mann Ki Baat, there are different kinds of information, but I have seen that there are information about cleanliness every time.
Honble Prime Minister, my greetings, first of all, I congratulate you that you have won these elections with greater votes.
I would like to tell you about my mind.
I want to say that people should understand the need for cleanliness in themselves.
I go through that river everyday where most people pollute the river by putting garbage in large quantities .
This river flows from the Rispana bridge and also comes to my house.
I want to say that we should bring this thing to light through a group or a News Paper.
Brothers and sisters, See how much affliction is the girl who is educated.
Seeing the fat and waste in the river it feels so angry .
I consider it a good symptom .
I want this thing, I want to create a shield of dirt in the minds of 125 crore Indians.
Since the Swachhta Movement has started, people have been aware.
Everyone has been positively connected to it.
Now this mission has taken the form of a movement.
Cleanliness is increasing.
It is a different significance to create awareness, to increase active participation.
However, cleanliness is more related to the habits than the movement.
This movement is a movement to change habits and is a movement to create a habit of cleanliness.
This movement can take place in a collective form.
The work is difficult, but it has to be done.
I am confident that the feelings that have been awakened between the new generations, children, students and the youth of the country are indicative of their own good results.
Today, I would like to tell all the people of Mann Ki Baat who are listening to the story of the cow, that the message of cows should be the message of each of you.
Have we ever thought that how much distress we do in the food that we put in.
Have you ever thought that if they don't put such a salt, they don't spend food, then how many poor people can fill their stomachs in it.
This is not a subject that has to be explained.
When the food increases in the mother's child at home, she says that the child should wear as much as he wants.
Some or the other efforts are being made but the sadness in this regard is a social oppression.
This is an injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if the savings are saved then the family will benefit.
I don't want to talk much about this, but I want to increase awareness.
I am aware of some youngsters who run such a campaign.
He has prepared a mobile app.
Where such food is supplied or where they talk to others and use them properly.
The youngsters of our country are doing such hard work.
You will find such people in every state of India.
Their life also inspires us not to eat food as much as you want.
Those people who are aware of health are always telling us that they keep a little empty stomach .
I will tell the countrymen that apathy is not an unprecedented disorder.
A psychological environment has to be created and then treatment begins.
Its first mantra is to emerge and open instead of pressing sadness.
Tell your colleagues, friends, parents, brothers and teachers openly what happened to you.
Sometimes the problem of loneliness occurs more in the students living in the hostel .
He doesn't come to the table of food.
Is it our attention to why he does this
This is the first step towards despair.
If he avoids staying with the common family and goes alone then it will not happen and pay attention to it very well.
Look at those people with whom he walks openly.
Encourage him to express his smile and open the tumor in his mind.
This is the best solution.
Depression can be the cause of mental and physical diseases .
Just as diabetes invites all diseases, it attacks the ability to fight, adventure and decide and destroys this ability.
Your friends, your family and your environment can keep you away from being sad, if you are sad, you can also get you out of that mentality.
There is another solution.
If we are unable to open with the people near us then do one thing and go to a place where the work is going on in the vicinity of the service.
If we strive to understand their grief, we will have a new self-confidence in our mind.
By connecting with others , by serving someone and by serving with selflessness the stress of mind becomes easy .
However, Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is very beneficial for freedom from tension , freedom from pressure , happiness .
June 21 is the International Day of Yoga.
Let us also prepare from now on and celebrate millions of collective Yoga festivals.
If you want to inform me about Yoga Day then you can reach me through my mobile application.
We should do so that we can create songs and poems on Yoga so that this topic can be accessible to the people.
In the last few days, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
It is sure that the number of women working in our country is increasing every day.
He is responsible for the family, he is responsible for the financial responsibility of the household, which sometimes leads to injustice to the newborn.
The Government of India has taken an important decision in this regard.
During the pregnancy, during the pregnancy, maternity menstruation, which was received 12 weeks before, will now be given 26 weeks.
In this regard, only two or three countries in the world are ahead of us.
India has taken an important decision for its sisters.
Its original objective should be to take care of the newborn who is the future citizen of India.
If she is taken care of her in the childhood, she gets the love of her mother then this child will be the glory of the country tomorrow.
This will also improve the health of mothers and therefore the benefit of this important decision will be about 18 lakh women.
Let us get inspiration from the lives of all these great men, let us get the strength to resolve for a New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shukal is a representative, I convey my best wishes to you all for this New Year.
It is time for the farmers to start harvesting after the spring season and take the fruits of their hard work.
New Year is welcomed in different parts of our country.
The New Year is welcomed by Gudhipadwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Andhra and Karnataka, Sindhi Chetti-Chand, Kashmir Navreh, Sanvatsar Pooja in Awadh Region, Mithila Region in Bihar, Satuwani in Magadh Region.
India is a country with innumerable diversity.
My best wishes to you all on this New Year.
Thank you very much.
The winter is now over.
Spring season has entered the life of all of us.
The peacock of mango which is the fruit of summer season starts appearing in spring only .
At the same time, the yellow flowers of pomegranate in the fields give a new look to the minds of the farmers.
The dry flowers of pulses indicate the ginger of Holi .
Amir Khusro has described the moment of this change in nature.
Amir Khusro wrote, "Ful Rahi Sarason Sakal Ban, Ambawa Foot, Tesu Fool, Coal Bole, Dar-Dar.
Whenever the nature is happy and the environment is happy then man also enjoys the full joy of this season.
The festival of Basant Panchami , Mahashivaratri and Holi fills the color of happiness in human life .
We will leave the last month of Falgun in an atmosphere full of love, brotherhood and humanity and we are ready to welcome the coming month.
Spring season is the confluence of these two months.
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions of citizens of the country for this thing that whenever I ask you people for the Mann Ki Baat, I get a lot of information.
Shobha ji, I thank you for remembering India's proud achievement.
Whether it is poverty eradication, prevention of diseases, connecting with the world, knowledge, information, technology has underlined its importance.
15th February, 2017 is a glorious day in Indias lives.
Our scientists have proudly raised Indias mind in front of the world and you all know that ISRO has successfully completed several missions in the last few years.
In the last few days, ISRO has set up a global record in the space sector after successfully successfully sending the Mangalyaan under the Mars Mission.
This success will not only be historic for ISRO but also for the common country.
ISRO's Coast Efficient Space Programme has been a wonder for the world and the world has also lauded the success of Indian scientists with an open heart.
Brothers and sisters, One of these 104 satellites is Cartosat 2D, which is India's satellite and this satellite will be used for photographs, information, mapping, infrastructure development, information about development and urban development planning.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters, how many water resources are there across the country, how can they be used
It is also a matter of happiness for us that the leadership of this common campaign was done by our young scientists , our lady scientists .
This huge participation of youth and women is a sign of great pride in the success of ISRO.
I congratulate the scientists of ISRO on the behalf of all the countrymen.
These scientists have maintained the objective of using space science for the common man and for the service of the nation and are recording new records.
Whatever we congratulate our scientists and their team, it will be less.
The scientists of India have shown this thing.
The capability of this missile is that even from a distance of 2000 kilometres, a missile has come to attack India, but our missile will destroy it in space.
When we see some new technologies, some new scientific discovery then we feel happy.
Those who don't get the same answer, they don't sit healthy.
And if we observe the journey of thousands of years of human revolution then we can say that this development journey is not complete anywhere.
New science, new technologies are manufactured by it and every technologies, the form of every new science, the form of a new era.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, I have often told Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should enhance the attraction of science.
The country needs many scientists.
Today's scientific science can be the reason for a sustainable change in the lives of future generations.
A few days ago, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had organised a variety of competitions during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Invites social useful discovery.
Sometimes the problem highlights the importance of science for finding solutions.
In Mumbai, there was heavy rains in 2005, there was a flood in Mahapur, there was a flood in the sea and there were many difficulties.
Whenever there is a natural crisis, then most of the times the crisis comes upon the poor.
Two people have worked towards this thing with their hearts and developed a way of constructing a house which will save the house during such a crisis, save the residents of the house, save the water from coming home and protecting the diseases occurring due to polluted water.
The system is also being technologically operated.
In a way, technology is becoming an integral part of our life.
In the last few days, there has been an increase in emphasis on DG-Dhan.
Especially the younger generation has the habit of making digital payments from their mobile phones.
I believe that this is a good symptom.
In the last few days, we have got good support for the 'Bhagwan Consumer Scheme' and Digi-Dhan Business Scheme.
It was about two months, 15 thousand people are getting one thousand rupees per day.
Through these two schemes, the goal of making digital payments in India a mass movement has been welcomed across the country.
It is a matter of great pleasure that under the DG-Dhan Yojana, more than 10 lakh people have got remuneration, more than 50,000 businessmen have got their remuneration and more than Rs. 1.
There are more than 100 consumers in this scheme who have received one lakh rupees per annum.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received Rs. 50-5,000.
While expressing happiness from Mysore, Shri Santosh wrote on the Narendra Modi App that he received a thousand rupees award in the Bhagwan Consumer Scheme.
But I feel that he has written an important thing to reach you.
He has written that when he received a thousand rupees, he was reminded that a poor woman's house was set on fire and all the goods were burnt in the fire.
Santosh ji, your name and your work are satisfactory to all of us.
We have done a very big inspirational work.
Bhai Sabir, a 20-year-old driver of Delhi, has now been linked to digital transactions after the ban on bondage and the government's fortunate consumer scheme has given him an amount of Rs.
A young student from Maharashtra is performing Pooja, Post-School courses, how is the use of RuPay cards and e-wallets in his family and feelings of how much joy they can do.
How important is the award of one lakh rupees for them, but they have taken up this work as a version and connecting others with it.
This movement has played a very important role in the fight against justice, corruption and black money.
Everyone associated with this work is an anti-corruption cadre of the country and an anti-corruption team in my view.
In a way, we are a warrior of goodness.
On 14th April, a huge and crores of rupees will be disposed off.
There are more than forty-five days.
Remembering them, we should teach at least 125 people to download the BHIM App.
Learn how it was exchanged.
Teach those small and small businessmen who are around you especially.
On this occasion, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar and Bhima App should be given special importance.
And therefore I would like to tell you that the foundation of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar has to be strengthened.
BHIM App has to be provided to 125 crore hands by going home and connecting everyone.
The movement that has been started for the last two-three months has resulted in a lot of success in several urban settlements, several villages and many cities.
My dear countrymen, the agriculture sector has a great contribution at the root of the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village boosts the economic pace of the country.
Today I would like to tell you a very happy thing.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have filled cereals with hard work.
This year, there is a record production due to the hardships of the farmers of our country.
The records are telling us that our farmers have made all the records of the past.
This year, there has been such a crop in the fields that everyday it seems that the pangal and the Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand and seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is more than eight percent of the previous records in the name of our farmers.
This itself is an unprecedented success.
I especially thank the farmers of the country.
Thanks to the fact that along with traditional crops, the poor people of the country should think about the production of pulses because most proteins are available to the poor from pulses.
I am glad that the farmers of my country have heard the voice of the poor and about two hundred nineteen lakh hectares of land have planted various pulses.
This is not just the production of pulses but the poor people of my country who have done it.
I have a request, one prayer. My farmer brothers and sisters are eligible for the way my farmers have produced pulses and produced pulses.
My dear countrymen, in this country, some initiatives are being taken by the government from the society, from the institutions, from the organizations and from everybody in the field of cleanliness.
In a way, everybody looks aware of cleanliness in some way.
The government is also constantly making efforts.
A few days ago, a programme of 23 senior officers of the State Governments led by their Secretaries led by the Drinking Water and Sanitation Account of our Government of India was held in Telangana.
What is the significance of hygiene work in a closed room in the heritage of the state of Telangana
Experimenting it on 17th and 18th February toilet painting exercise was organised in Hyderabad .
The toilet pits of six households were evacuated and most of them themselves showed that the twin pit toilet used can be used empty and used again.
He also showed how convenient the toilets constructed using these new technologies and there is no hesitation about cleanliness while evacuating them.
As we clean up others, we can clean a toilet.
And it is the sanitation of the rocks of the toilet that we consider it as a fertilizer, it is a kind of black gold.
We can see how wealth is produced from waste and it has been proved.
One Standard Twin Pit Toilet for the families of six people, this model is filled in about five years.
After that, the waste can be removed easily and left in another pit.
There was a dissolution of waste collected in the pit for six to twelve months.
Nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium are rich in nutrients and are considered to be the best fertilizer in the field of agriculture.
The way the government has taken this initiative, others have also taken initiatives.
Now a special programme has been started on Doordarshan.
It will benefit as much as these things will be spread.
Different departments of the government are organising Swachhta Pandharwada regularly.
In the second Pandarwada of March, the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will carry forward the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We are convinced that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, then the whole country feels a new energy, self-confidence is increasing.
We welcomed the achievements made by our Divyang sportspersons in the Rio Para Olympics.
He is proud of the success of these Divyang Partners.
I often believe that the Divyang brothers and sisters are strong, determined, courageous and determined.
Every moment we can learn something or the other from them.
Whether it is a matter of sports or space science, women of our country are not behind anyone.
A few days ago, our women team won the silver medal in the Asian Ragbi Savens Trophy competition.
I congratulate all these sportspersons.
Women's Day is celebrated in the world on 8th March.
In India too, there should be an increase in awareness and sensitivity in the family and society for giving importance to girls.
This mission is moving forward at a rapid pace.
Today it was not just a government programme.
Today it has become a movement of social sensitivity and public education.
In the last two years, this initiative has been linked to the common man.
This initiative has participated in considering these burning issues in every corner of the country.
People's thoughts have changed about the old customs that have been going on for years.
It is very pleasant when the news of the festival was celebrated after the birth of a girl.
In a way, positive ideas about girls are becoming the cause of social approval.
I have heard that Kuddolor district in the state of Tamil Nadu has been imprisoned under a special campaign.
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to the 'Mulgi Bachao-Mulgi Teachers' scheme and efforts are being made by the district administration to ensure that orphan girls get their education along with organisation of Gram Sabhas.
In Madhya Pradesh, every household knock has been undertaken for education in villages and household girls.
In Rajasthan, efforts are being made to inspire the girls who have left the school to re-school the Apana Bachcha, Apana Vidyalaya.
New ideas are being linked to it.
It has changed according to local requirements.
When we celebrate Women's Day on 8th March, we will have the same feeling: "Woman, who is Shakti, who is the woman of India, who is not the woman of India, who is the officer of the work, who is the officer of the people of the country, my dear countrymen, you all get the opportunity to interact with Mann Ki Baat.
We were also actively involved.
I am extremely grateful to you for your participation.
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
On 26th January, we celebrated our Republic Day with joy and enthusiasm every corner of the country.
Reminding the Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens and our commitment to democracy, this festival is a festival that will create a culture of democracy in the next generations and awaken the responsibility of fulfilling democracy.
But in our country, there is no longer any discussion about the rights and duties of the citizens as much as they need to be discussed in a broader manner.
I hope that at every level, the more important rights are given, the more important duties are to be given.
On this day, at 11 o'clock in the morning, we pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the country.
On the day of 30th January, at 11 o'clock in the morning, it should be a societal and a simple nature of ours as a nation.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I congratulate the families of the brave soldiers who were honored with various bravery awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishva Seva Medal, Special Service Medal.
I, especially the youth of the country, are very active on social media.
Can you do one thing at this time, the brave brave people who have received this honour should find the information on the Internet and write two good words about them to reach their friends.
When we know about the courage and valour of these brave heroes, we feel surprised, pride and inspiration.
On the one hand, we were happy to read the news of the celebrations of 26th January, while the soldiers who were deployed to protect the borders of our country in Kashmir had lost their lives due to snowfall.
I pay homage to all those brave soldiers and salute them.
My young friends, you are aware that I keep telling you your Mann Ki Baat continuously.
All the months of January, February, March, April i. e.
Almost every household has a test of one or two children but all the families used to be buried under that test.
It seemed that this time is appropriate to interact with my students friends, their parents and teachers because for many years, wherever I go, wherever I visit, wherever I visit those who meet them, the tests of children will be very careful.
A big strange mental situation is being created in every household that the family is worried, the students are careful and the teachers are deprived of.
When I had announced that I would talk about it, many teachers, parents and students had sent me messages, sent questions, sent some information, the problems and difficulties that you had to face.
I would like to express my thoughts in my mind by reading them all.
I got a telephone message of creation.
Listen to you, sir, I would like to tell you that during the days of the examination, our houses and neighbours and our society had a very terrible atmosphere.
It does not happen to the minds of the students but we become sad.
I want to ask you so much that this environment cannot be happy
The question is true, but it will be in the mind of all of us.
There are very few people who are present in the examination.
Most of them used to be a test.
It is a matter of fact that you have to decide on the Pleasure.
The place of happiness and pleasure that this examination will be accompanied by the same brown fruits and the time will come upon the pressure that will be bursted.
Therefore, I believe that you should face the examinations as if it was a festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
The entire family should play a very enthusiastic role in fulfilling this festival.
On seeing the picture will change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, there are examinations in these three-four months.
These three-four months, according to their traditions, transform the environment of your family into the time of festival.
And that is why I will tell you, smile More, score more.
In a stressful state all the doors are closed and nothing can go inside from outside and can not come out inside.
As if the process of thinking stops and they sit loaded.
And you don't have any knowledge, there is a lack of information, where is the hard work done
But when there is tension then your knowledge, your knowledge, your information that is with you will be buried under it and there is a stress on it.
It is necessary to keep in mind the A Happy Mind for a good market-sheet.
Sometimes it seems that we don't look at the examination with the right point of view.
It is our mindset that there should be a question of life and death.
This will be a test of what you have studied throughout the year.
Your entire life will not be able to cover it there.
This is not a test of what kind of life you have lived, what kind of life you have to live.
In the class, you might have gone through several criteria in addition to the tests taken by the customers.
Then be free from such a destruction and before all of us, the former President of the country, Dr.
J.
The biggest challenge that I see in today's era is the centre of education.
Markets are getting a lot of importance.
This has not only increased the competition but also increased the stress on the minds of the students.
I want to know your ideas about the current and future of the education system.
In fact, he has given a reply in his question but Rincha wishes to give me some opinions on this subject.
There is a limited use of qualities and qualities.
If you believe in these things, then Mark will come back from you and you will never need to run away from them.
You will be able to utilize knowledge in your life, you will be able to use your colony, you will be able to utilize your confidence and determination.
Whether you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger rivalry and see the mark sheet
The successful journey of its experience, knowledge and lawyership is seen here.
Therefore, these markets sometimes stop us from going in the right direction.
Richa ji has also raised the issue of continuous competition with others.
This is a huge psychological battle.
The examples related to sports are easier to understand, so I say that.
The specialty of most successful sportspersons was that their competition was with themselves.
Let us take the example of Sachin Tendulkar.
Their journey has been that we should go ahead with defeating ourselves for twenty years.
It should be a wonderful thing because they followed the path of competing with others.
In every field of AYUSH, you should also ask yourself about the same question as I could study calmly for two hours before.
Is it too late to get up early in the morning
Whether you don't have to sleep because of the stress of the examination beforehand
My mother had not learned much.
Yet he used to sit with me and leave the mathematics from me.
I will only tell parents that they should focus on three things, give acceptance, teaching and time.
The parents will feel that the expectations from the children of their teachers are at the root of many problems.
The burden on you will also be removed.
I was present there then and I saw that he did not ask any question about the health of the patient.
He started listening to Vinodi quietly.
In four-five minutes, the atmosphere was smooth.
ARV keeps on talking about the disease going to meet the patient and keeps them scared .
I want to tell my parents that sometimes we are aware of being with children.
Have we ever thought of providing a happy and smiling environment to the children during the examination
So, see, the atmosphere will change.
I have received another big call from Kamali.
He said, Namaskar Prime Minister, I cannot tell myself because my childhood was working.
I had once tried to copy my childhood.
And whenever I tried to copy it, I was caught and many friends around me have suffered a lot.
These shortcut roads are the reasons for copying.
You must have heard this.
I will also say the same again.
Anyway, the effect of copying will be seen.
If that creativity is spent on the issue of examination then perhaps there will be no need to copy.
A phone call has come to me, he says, "Namskar Prime Minister, My name is Monica, I am a 12th student so I want to ask you some questions related to board examinations.
My first question is about the growing tension during these examinations and how can it be reduced
If I talk about sports and activities in the past days then your teachers and your parents will be on me.
He said how the Prime Minister is telling the children to play during the examination.
Because sports focused on reducing the attention of studies, we have a common understanding.
This idea is basically wrong.
The root cause of the problem is there.
Sit out of your practice for two minutes and see the sky, see the nearby trees, slightly lighten the mind and then sit in your room.
Whether it is for five minutes but give it yourself the time of rest .
You will see that the work was going to be more luxurious.
Everyone likes it or not, but my experience tells me the same.
There is no need to sit in the room for that.
If you stand under the open eye, go to the gutchi, breathe for five minutes and then sit on the practice.
Some people understand that if you wake up very late at night then practice will take place very much .
But not.
Definitely take as much sleep as the body is necessary .
Your efficiency will increase.
Whenever I go to the publicity of the elections, sometimes my voice is sitting.
I had come here to meet a folk singer during this meeting.
He asked me, How many hours do you sleep
But it does not mean that we keep sleeping continuously.
However, the people of your house will live upon me.
It is a very big medicine for keeping mind , mind and body aware .
Yes, young friends, you are engaged in the preparation of the examinations and I am stuck in my mind.
Kunas Thouk, perhaps my speech will help in removing the stress on your mind.
But at the same time, I will also say that do not take care of what I have said.
If you are collecting, don't do it or it will also become a burden.
I am also aware of the fact that I do not put the burden of expectations on children.
Keeping your determination in mind and believing yourself, let the tests be overcome.
My best wishes are with you.
In order to cross every criteria, give the same criterion the form of a festival.
And then no examination will be held.
You go ahead with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is celebrating forty years on 1st February, 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the officers and soldiers of the Coast Guard for the service of the country.
The Indian Coast Guard, along with 126 ships and 62 aircraft, is the fourth largest Coast Guard in the world.
The soldiers of the Coast Guard are ready to safeguard the maritime boundaries and maritime areas of the country while guiding this ideal dimension.
Last year, the people of the Coast Guard have been proud to work with their responsibilities and to clean the sea coast of our country.
Thousands of people had participated in this event.
He is truly complimented for the sanitation of these shores along with the safety of the sea coasts.
Very few people must be aware that not only men but also women in the coastal forces of our country are performing their responsibilities on their shoulders as much as possible.
Our women officers in the Coast Guard are aeronautics, observers, handling the responsibility of the hovercraft.
I convey my condolences to the Indian Coast Guard on the 40th anniversary of the Indian Coast Guard to safeguard Indias shores today as a question of coastal security at the global level.
On 1st February, the festival of Basant Panchami will be celebrated.
He is considered the time of the teachings of the student.
Not only this, this time is an inspiration for the heroes.
The same inspiration is seen in the song 'Mera Rang de Basanti Chola'.
On the auspicious occasion of this spring Panchami, I extend my best wishes to all my countrymen.
My dear countrymen, while spreading Mann Ki Baat, Akashwani is also innovating in it with its innovation.
Mann Ki Baat provides a huge opportunity to connect with you.
My best wishes.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, I convey my best wishes to you all.
Today is a day to give importance to service, sacrifice and sacrifice in our lives.
Jesus Christ has said that if we do not want our benefits to the poor then we should accept it.
St. Luke has written in Gaspel that it has not only served the poor but also appreciated the service made by the poor and this is the true empowerment.
A story related to this is well known.
It is said in that story that Jesus was standing near the treasure of a temple .
Several eminent people came and donated a lot.
Thereafter, a poor widow came and she kept a copper coin in it.
Now, if you go to see it then what is the cost of two copper coins
The hearts of the devotees standing there were surprised .
Yesun said that the widow has donated the most and others have donated a lot but this woman has donated everything that she has.
Two days ago, I got the opportunity to inaugurate several development works in Varanasi, which was the penance place of Malviya ji.
I laid the foundation stone of His Majesty Madan Mohan Malviya Cancer Centre in Varanasi.
Today is the birthday of Bharat Ratna and former Prime Minister, Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Our country will never be able to forget the contributions made by Atal ji.
He also highlighted the dignity of the country in the field of nuclear energy under his leadership.
Whether it is a party leader or a member of Parliament or a minister or a Prime Minister, Atal ji had created an ideal in every land.
I salute Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for his good health.
As an activist, I was fortunate to work with Atal ji.
Several memories are awakened in front of me today.
When I tweeted this morning, I shared an old painting on it and I would certainly understand how Atal ji's affection was in the form of a small worker.
Today, as a visit to NATAL, the citizens of the country will get the benefit of two schemes.
In a sense, two new schemes are being launched.
Everyone has to learn and understand from each other.
In order to promote this process, the Central Government's Incentive Scheme for consumers and small traders is being launched from today to empower mobile banking.
Fortunate Consumer Scheme is a scheme to promote consumers, while Digi Dhan Business Scheme is a scheme to promote traders.
This scheme will start from today and the next 100 days will continue.
Every day, 15,000 people will be given an arrears of Rs. 1,000 per day.
At the same time, one day long will be released for such consumers in which lakhs of rupees will be disbursed and on 14th April, three months later, Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary will be held on that day in which crores of rupees will be given away.
Digi Dhan Business Scheme is mainly for traders.
Entrepreneurs should automatically participate in this scheme and include consumers to free their transactions.
Independent briefings will also be given for such businessmen and these briefs will also be in thousands of numbers.
The traders will continue to do their own business and they will also get the opportunity to win the beard.
This scheme has been prepared by keeping all sections of the society, especially the poor and the lower middle class citizens in the centre.
Those who buy more than Rs. 3,000 will not get the benefit of these bulls.
The poorest of the poor can also buy goods through a feature phone or a simple phone using USSD, sell goods, provide money and all of them can be beneficiaries of this Bakshis scheme.
Even in rural areas, shopping and sale can be done through AEPS.
30 crore citizens will soon be involved in this Bakshis scheme.
This is very simple, it is as easy as we send a message from the Whatsapp.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to see how to use technology in our country, how to make e-payment and how to make online payments.
In the last few days, cashless transactions have increased by 200 to 300.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
The businessmen can definitely guess how big this decision is.
Those traders who exchange digital routes, provide online payments instead of cash in their charge, have been exempted from income tax.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Mr.
A Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Shri Chandrababu Naidu.
At the same time, I have seen that the state governments have started several schemes and have started their implementation.
Somebody told me that the Assam government has decided to give 10 discount if wealth tax and trade allowance fees are made digitally.
The branches of rural banks, which will take at least two digital transactions through their 75 percent consumers during January-March, will get the government's discount of Rs.
He has also announced an outlay of Rs. 5 lakh under Best Panchayat for Digital Transfers to 100 Digital Transaction villages by 31st March, 2017.
The Assam Government has announced a discount of Rs. 5,000 to the first ten farmers who are fully filled with digital forms of seeds and fertilizers for the purchase of seeds and fertilizers under the Digital Farmer Shiromani Scheme.
I congratulate the Assam Government and congratulate all the governments who have taken up such initiatives.
Several organisations have carried out several successful experiments to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in the villages.
Someone told me that the companies related to Gujarat Narmada Gulf, Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited have installed POS machines where fertilizers are sold for the benefit of the farmers. In just a few days, 35,000 farmers have purchased fertilizers by digitizing 5 lakh fertilizers.
It is a matter of concern that the sale of fertilizers in the company has increased by 27 per cent this year as compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, the scope of informal sector has increased in our lifestyle and we are aware that most of these people are given wage money, work money or wages, cash payment and they continue to exploit the workers.
Wherever one gets 100 rupees, one gets 80 rupees.
They are also empowering those benefits which are beneficial.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is our ease.
The country like India should be at the forefront of this region.
Our youth have also made a lot of progress in the field of start-ups.
These are the golden days of the digital movement.
They should do this that our youth can empower the region with new ideas, new technologies and new methods.
At the same time, all of us should participate in the campaign to free the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge people to give their suggestions before Mann Ki Baat every month.
Out of the suggestions received by MyGov and Narendra Modi App, 80 to 90 percent of the suggestions are related to the fight against corruption and black money.
When I saw all these things, I had divided them into three parts of Dhobal Mana.
Some people have given me a detailed reference to what kind of problems and irregularities the citizens have to face.
In spite of such a good work for the welfare of the country, even though such a sacred work is being done, how new ways of discharge are being discovered at some places.
The third kind of people have written that the fight should continue to continue with the support of what happened.
It is also significant that the number of citizens who urged them to take tough steps if they need corruption and black money should be completely destroyed.
I express my gratitude to all the countrymen who have helped me send a lot of letters.
Shri Gurumani Kewal highlighted that the steps taken to completely prevent black money transactions are commendable.
We are fighting against corruption and black money like the armed forces.
The words written on the notes are wrong, the rate of sweets has increased, the notes of two thousand will be canceled, the notes of 500 and 100 rupees will be canceled.
However, after listening to all these rumors, the minds of the people of this country remained firm.
Not only this, many people landed in the field, they brought the true face of the people who used their skills and wisdom and proved that Afwa was wrong and brought the truth to everyone.
I bow down to this strength of the people.
My dear countrymen, today I feel that when 125 crore Indians stand with you, nothing is impossible.
Jannadan is the form of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for taking part in this great war of corruption and black money.
I was sure that there should be a comprehensive discussion in the House regarding the fight against corruption and black money.
If the work of the House was done then there would have been a good discussion.
Some people are spreading all kinds of concessions to political parties, they are completely wrong.
The law is the same for all.
Be it individuals, organisations or political parties, everybody should follow the law and everybody has to do it.
Those who cannot openly support corruption and black money spend time in finding the errors of the government.
There is also a question of repeated change of rules.
This government is for the people.
For 70 years, how much will the power of those who have been involved in this time of dishonest and corruption
When I decided to fight such people, they started a new effort to defeat the government of Suddha.
On the other hand, several citizens have also written letters to discuss the non-compliances and various changes.
The common man is giving more information than the information that is coming from the government system.
The success we have achieved is due to the awareness of the common citizens.
In order to provide such information, the government has prepared an e-mail card and it can be sent to it.
I express my gratitude to all those who wrote such letters, who have faith and blessings in their letters.
This is not a complete break.
This is the beginning.
There is no question of tiredness, there is no question of stoppage and there is no question of taking up the blessings of 125 crore people for the work.
You must be aware that there is a law in the context of Benami Property in our country and in 1988 this law was created.
He was kept in the basan.
We took it out and implemented the Effective Benami Property Act.
In the coming days, this law will show its impact.
We have been at the top priority to do what is required for the welfare of the people.
Indias ranking has improved in the World Banks Industry Report.
India has jumped 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have jumped 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and the World Banks Inland Performance Index has jumped 19 places in 2016.
The evaluation of many reports is guiding such a way that India is moving forward rapidly.
My dear countrymen, this time the people of the country were disappointed with the Parliament session.
Everyone expressed his anger in the context of the functioning of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also openly expressed dissatisfaction over it.
However, in such a situation sometimes there are some good things and the mind gets satisfaction.
There was a good work in the Parliament, but the country did not notice it.
Brothers and sisters, I am proud to say that a bill related to the campaign that my government has taken forward for the Disabilities has been passed in Parliament.
I express my gratitude to all the MPs of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha for this. I express my gratitude to them on behalf of crores of people with disabilities.
Our government is also committed to the Disabilities.
I have tried to speed up the Suddha campaign, Personally.
I wished that the persons with disabilities should get their rights and they should be respected.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters, by winning four medals in the Paralympics, have reinforced our efforts and confidence.
With his victory, he raised the country's dignity and imagined the people with his capabilities.
Our Divyang brothers and sisters have an invaluable heritage like every citizen of the country.
I am glad that after this legislation is passed for the benefit of the Divyangjans, they will get more job opportunities.
Reservation limit has also been increased to 4 in government jobs.
The Government has adopted a new legislation in accordance with the ideas of the United Nations.
14 categories have been added to this.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, we will be proud of the fields of sports.
The Indian Cricket Federation won 4-0 of the ongoing warrior against England.
Some of the young sportspersons have done commendable work.
Our young sportsperson Karun Nayar has done three decades, then K.

Virat Kohli, the Karnadhar of the Kasoti Sangh, had a good leadership of the team while doing good work.
Indian Cricket Associations of Spinner Golandaz R.

My heartfelt congratulations to all of them.
In the field of hockey, a good news has come up after 15 years.
The Junior Hockey team has won the World Cup.
After 15 years, the Junior Hockey team has named the World Cup.
Congratulations to the young sportspersons for this achievement.
This achievement is very happy with the future of the Indian Hockey Federation.
Our women sportspersons also performed well last month.
The Hockey team of Indian women won the Asian Financial Games and recently, the Indian women team earned bronze medals at the Asia Cup Games 18 years ago.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the sportspersons of the cricket and hockey team.
My dear countrymen, the year 2017 will be a new year of joy and enthusiasm, all our resolves should be fulfilled and we should commemorate new heights of development.
This New Year will also give the poorest of the poor an opportunity to live a life of happiness.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the year 2017.
Thank you very much
Like every year, I had visited India-China Simmer to celebrate Diwali with our Indian soldiers.
I celebrated Diwali in the higher part of the Himalayas along with the soldiers of ITBP and the soldiers of the Armed Forces.
Every time it goes, but the experience of Diwali was different.
The reflection of the 125 crore citizens of the country, the unique way they dedicated to the soldiers of Diwali, dedicated to the security forces, was reflected on the faces of every soldier.
Some poems, some paintings, some cartoons, some people made video.
I was surprised when I read these letters.
These letters are full of innovation and emotions.
At the same time, there was an information on My Gov, whether the coffee table book could be made by collecting selected things in it
A soldier from our armed forces wrote to me, Prime Minister, Holi of our soldiers, Diwali, every festival is on the border.
It seemed as if we are celebrating Diwali with 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, in this Diwali, the feelings that you have expressed about our armed forces will be limited to some occasions.
I urge you to take this habit as a society, as a nation, as a nation, to keep in mind the soldiers of our country, be it festival or festival or be it festival.
When the entire nation stands with the Armed Forces, the strength of our army increases by 125 crore.
A few days ago, Sarpanch from the state of Jammu and Kashmir had come to meet me.
He was a member of the Jammu-Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
They had come from different parts of the Kashmir Valley, about 40-50 people.
I got the opportunity to speak to him for a long time.
He had come up with issues about the development of his village.
They had some demands and when our interaction started, the situation in the Kashmir Valley, law and order and the future of children came up.
In Kashmir, schools were burnt to fire and I saw that they were suffering as much as they were suffering from.
He said that the future network of children is not a school but also a school.
I urge them to look at the future of these children.
A few days ago, the board was tested and the children and girls of Kashmir, about 95 percent of the students and students tested the board.
I congratulate them for their enthusiasm, but I congratulate their parents, relatives and their teachers and Sarpanch of all the Gram Panchayats.
Brothers and sisters, When I asked you for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that everyone has sent information on the same subject.
All of them used to say that we should talk about 500 and 1000 notes in detail.
I was also aware of the fact that in our daily life, we will have to face many kinds of new difficulties.
The way to get rid of the diseases we had faced for 70 years cannot be easy.
I can understand the problems faced by you.
500 and thousand notes and such a big country, such a huge currency, billions of notes and these decisions.
The whole world is watching Barkains, every economist analyses this.
The central government, state governments, departments of local governments, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than one and a half lakh post offices, more than one lakh banks, friends and people have been associated with dedication.
Despite many types of tensions, all of them are working with a calm mind to consider this task as a yagna of service to the nation as an attempt to transform it.
They start in the morning, when will it be completed at night
Suddenly there was a need for money.
Several such incidents emerge from TV, newspapers and discussions every day.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all these colleagues who have worked hard in this great mission.
The identity of the power was only when success is achieved after the deficit.
I remember that when the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was started and the bank employees had taken the burden on their shoulders and the work that was not done in 70 years was done by them.
Today, once again he has accepted the challenge and I am confident that the resolution of 125 crore Indians will push this nation with a new strength for the collective men of all.
But the bad habits have spread so much that even today many people do not get those bad habits.
Some people still feel that the money of corruption, the money of black money, the money of anonymity, the money of anonymity, some of them should be brought back to the system by finding some roads.
They are searching for illegal ways to save their money.
Sadly, he has chosen the way to use the poor in this regard.
They are trying to save the money by paying money in their accounts by illusioning the poor and showing temptation.
Today, I want to tell those people who do not want to amend or not to amend their wishes and not to amend their laws.
But do not play with the lives of the poor by doing good work.
And the government does not want that our countrymen will be in trouble.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village, Taluka Tirali, G Hadra and Madhya Pradesh.
It is commendable that we have closed the notes of five hundred and thousand rupees.
I would like to bring many such examples from Mann Ki Baat to the people that people have welcomed this tough step for the nation's progress even after being unconscious.
Because we used to say that good days will come, but we would take such a big step.
The people of black money and corruption have got a good deal to see all these notes of five hundred and thousand rupees.
There will never be a good day for every Indian.
I am so happy that I am so proud that the common man of my country has a unique potential.
People go there and eat there and after 2-4-6 days when they go from there then they pay money.
This is the strength of my country, which has a sense of service, sacrifice and authenticity.
During the elections, I had taken up the Chai Pe Discussion initiative and this thing was done all over the world.
But I couldn't know that marriages are attached to Chai Pe Church.
A daughter in Surat in Gujarat gave only tea to the people who had married her.
Once I was watching the news on TV, I was late in the night and in Assam, Dhekiyajuli is a small village named Dhekiyajuli.
Now, when they got a note of Rs. 2000, what did they do
Four women from the neighbourhood came together and they went to the market and bought them together and used a note of Rs. 2000.
See how changes are being made in the lives of the villages.
Some people benefited from this mission.
I got the information about the small towns.
It was reported from about 40-50 cities that due to the closure of these notes, the old people did not pay the money.
We are aware that the poor people do not pay the money for taxes, water strips and electricity bills two days ago.
These big people, those who are familiar with them, those who knew that no one would ask them, they would not pay the money and they would be very tired.
Each municipality deposits 50 of the taxpayers.
However, due to the decision of the 8th date, all of them were running to deposit their old notes.
Last year, about Rs. 3,500 crore was deposited in 47 urban departments.
You will be surprised to hear that you will be surprised to know that in a week, Rs. 13 thousand crore has been deposited to them.
But I congratulate the farmers of my country today.
I had recently taken stock of the crop production in this season.
The farmers have discovered the path of difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority.
Small businessmen of our country send jobs and help in increasing the economy.
Just like the big malls, the small shopkeepers of the village will be able to do their business for 24 hours. No laws will stop them.
Initiatives were taken to lend them through Mudra Yojana.
However, due to this decision, it was natural for them to face problems.
I would like to tell my younger brothers and sisters that there is an opportunity to enter the digital world.
You also download the banks on your mobile phones, you also keep POS machines for credit cards.
Learn how business can be done without using it.
You can see that the way big malls and technologies enhance our business, a small business manufacturer can enhance our business through a simple User Friendly Technology.
There is no possibility of any deterioration and there is an opportunity to increase.
I invite you to contribute very much to the creation of cashless society.
There are roads of technology, safe, trusted and faster.
I am confident that I would like to convey my best wishes to the labourers and the hardworking brothers and sisters that you have been exploited.
But Friends, we are my soldiers and friends.
We have a unique opportunity to serve Mother India and we have got the opportunity to take the country to an economic height.
This world doesn't have the older generation as much as we have experience.
We don't know what the previous generation used to do.
You know how online banking, online ticket booking are done.
There is nothing special in it.
But today the country wants to do a great thing, which is your dream, the cashless society, it is true that 100 per cent of us will not be successful but did not start.
If we start the cashless society then the goal is not far.
Wallet means e-packet.
Several types of cards are available.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have RuPay cards.
However, after the date of 8th, the poor have started using RuPay cards and its use has increased by about 300.
The way PRIPED cards are available for mobile phones and PRIPED cards are available to spend money in the bank account.
This work is so easy that just as we send the Whatsapp.
Very uneducated persons are aware of how to Forward Sudha Whatsup.
Moreover, technology is becoming so easy that there is no need for smart phones for this work.
Whether it is a dhobi or a vegetable seller or a milk seller or a present leaf or a tea seller, everyone can use it.
I have stressed on making this system easier.
All banks are working on this thing.
And now the online charge has been canceled and we must have read in the present paper of the last two-four days when we have removed the amount of charge.
The technologies that you want to spend online will be in your mobile phones.
Not only this, we should tell at least 10 families about half an hour or two hours a day, what is the technology, how is the use of technology and how can we download our bank
We have been leading this campaign to free the country from corruption, to free the country from black money, to liberate the people from difficulties and problems.
I believe that if the common man learns this system then he will be freed from work thinking and if all the youngsters of India swing themselves in this work then it will not take a long time.
Within a month we will be able to stand as a modern Indian in the world.
And we can do this work through mobile phones and you can go to 10 houses everyday.
I invite you that you should not only stop with support, we will be the army and bring about change.
Let us take this fight to free the country from corruption and black money.
And there are many countries in the world where the youngsters of the world have changed the lives of the nation and there was a revolution from the youth.
Kenya decided to set up a mobile system M-PESA, using technology, named M-PESA.
This country has created a big revolution.
My youngsters, I once again urge that this campaign is just ahead.
I invite you to work individually in schools, colleges, universities, NCCs, NSS, collectively and individually.
The most popular artist of this century, Amitabh ji is moving ahead with the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It seems that Swachhta is very well in her mind and that is why she remembers cleanliness on the occasion of her father's birth anniversary.
He writes a poem of Harivansh Raiji, one of them, one of them, one of them, one of them, one of them, one of them, one of the fun of fun of fun of life, my introduction to Mera-Harivansh Raivansh Rai.
My dear countrymen, I have always been associated with you through Mann Ki Baat, your ideas, your emotions, your letters, on MyGov and on the Narendra Modi App.
The Mann Ki Baat programme is spread at 11 o'clock, but we will soon be able to hear its translation from regional languages.
In every corner of India, the festival of Diwali is celebrated with joy and enthusiasm.
India is a country where 365 days of the year are celebrated somewhere or the other in the country.
Festival is the second name of the life of Indians. And it is natural for anyone who sees from far off places.
Since Vedas, the tradition of festivals of India has changed from time to time.
However, in all these journeys, one thing is recalled that this entire journey of festivals being organised in India has been linked to its intensity, its intensity and its impact on the people to the self-confidence.
The main objective of this objective is to expand individuality and individuality, to expand our limited ideas from society to the universe and achieve all these through festivals.
Our ancestors have scientificly incorporated all these things in the festivals to include food inclusion in the festivals of India, how the climate is, how the food should be consumed in which weather should be consumed, how the crops should be produced, how the days of cropping should be included in the festivals.
Today the whole world is discussing the environment.
The destruction of nature has become a matter of care.
The tradition of festivals of India is only giving a version to everybody from young children to folk who enhances love for nature.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains or birds, we celebrate a festival of responsibilities towards everybody.
We take holidays on Sunday, but the older generations used to take vacations on the day of mortality and full moon.
This darkness is not dark because of the lack of light but it is also darkness.
On the occasion of Diwali, it is an attempt to illuminate the blind people of the society, to remove the innocent blindness of the individuals and to illuminate the light of positiveness by lighting the light of light on Diwali.
The house of the poor is a utensil of soil, but it looks clean and shiny during the days of Diwali.
In that sense, Diwali is a cleanliness drive.
But not only at home but also cleanliness in the entire area, cleanliness in the streets and cleanliness of the entire village is the need of today's time.
In that context, we should expand this tradition of cleanliness.
This festival of Diwali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different ways in all the countries of the world.
Many governments from all over the world, Parliamentarians and administrators want to participate in the festival of Diwali.
You may be aware that the US Post Service has released a postage stamp on Diwali this year.
The Prime Minister of Canada has also shared his picture on Twitter on the occasion of Diwali.
The Prime Minister of Britain organized a grand programme to gather all the societies on Diwali in London and participated in it.
There is no such city in Britain that will not be celebrated with great enthusiasm.
What is the picture that the Prime Minister of Singapore has kept on Instagram and has shared with the entire world proudly
While 16 women MPs of Singapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament from the Indian Sadya Ness.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had recently visited New ealand, he said that we are going to return to New ealand soon to participate in the Diwali celebrations.
On this occasion, I would like to tell you that this festival of Diwali is a festival of inspiration that brings the global community from darkness to light.
In the festival of Diwali along with new clothes and various tasty food items , cracks are played with fun .
Small children and youngsters like to bury themselves .
Small children, however, sometimes don't feel enthusiastic, simultaneously invite a lot of troubles by simultaneously trying to make a big voice.
I don't remember what kind of things are there around you, whether there is a possibility of fire.
In the days of Diwali, news of such accidents, fire news and news of deaths is a matter of care.
During the days of Diwali, many doctors are eager to celebrate Diwali with their families.
In our country, the festival of Diwali goes on for a long time.
We also prepare for Chhathpuja while celebrating Diwali festival.
Chhatpuja festival is a big festival in the eastern part of India. This festival, which is believed to be the festival, runs for four days.
This festival gives a very meaningful message to the society.
It is difficult to observe what Surya deity gives us from that thing that we get from the direct and indirect Sun deity.
Chhath Puja is a festival of sun worship .
It is said that people worship the rising sun in the world.
But Chhathpuja is such a festival in which the sun is also worshipped.
A big social message is also given through that.
In my future, the sacrifice, penance and hard work of the soldiers of the security forces of the armed forces is a feeling of gratitude and I came to my mind with the same feeling that this year Diwali should be dedicated to these security forces.
I invited the countrymen to send a message to Soulgers for this campaign.
Today, I bow down to the people of India that there is no feeling of love, pride and respect towards the soldiers of the country.
The way this feeling has been expressed, every citizen has come to the forefront of a rapid power.
Through the messages of all of you, the soldiers of our security forces have got new courage and new patience.
Nobody has given a message to the soldiers of our country, whether it is schools, colleges, students, villages, poor people, businessmen, shopkeepers, political leaders, players, actors etc. have expressed their feelings.
The media has recognized Suddha as an opportunity to express gratitude to the Armed Forces.
Today, when we celebrate Diwali, somebody is standing in the desert, somebody is on the peaks of the Himalayas, somebody is protecting the industries, somebody is watching the security of the airport, all these soldiers are performing innumerable responsibilities.
I can imagine how proud it will be for the soldiers of my country.
Message to Soulgers has been reflected innumerable emotions on the hashtag.
Ashwini Kumar Chauhan has sent a poem and I am reading and showing it.
I speak Shivani Mohan.
Our armed builders are encouraging our message to Soulgers on the occasion of Diwali.
My father and brother-in-law were both officers of the army.
Our entire family is full of soldiers.
There are many officers in the Army Circle on the borders of the country who are getting good messages and they are getting greater encouragement.
I urge you to say that along with the officers and soldiers, their entire family and their wives also sacrifice a lot.
Through your messages, the entire army community is getting a good message and I also wish you all the best wishes for Diwali.
Whether it is natural calamities, the problems faced by law and order, the enemies or the brave actions to bring back the youth who are going wrongly, our soldiers are inspired by the nations emotions at every front of their lives.
I would like to tell you about an event and I would like to inspire you to achieve success.
We have an ITBP soldier in the security forces, development Thakur, who is a resident of a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
The name of his village is Badhana.
Our ITBP personnel had gone to our village during their holidays.
That is why Himachal Pradesh has proved to be an Open Defecation Free State in true sense.
Very few people go to those villages.
He said that there was no toilet at this place, the engineering students of the city, which were at some distance from the village.
NCC Chatra, NSS members and engineering students decided to construct toilets in the village.
All the goods, bricks, cements and all other essential things that have been required to build toilets have been used by the youth on their shoulders and brought them to the village all day.
They worked hard and built toilets in the village and showed a small village in the remote areas of the jungle free from open defecation.
Kerala will soon become an Open Defecation Free State.
Gujarat has declared Sudha all municipalities-Mahanagarpalika, more than 150 locations are open defecation free.
10 districts have been made ODF.
Haryana is going to celebrate its Golden Jubilee on 1st November and he has decided to free his state from open defecation in a few months.
So far, seven districts have become Open Defecation Free.
Work is going on at a rapid pace in all the states.
I have mentioned only a few states.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the citizens of all these states for their participation in this campaign and for contributing to the blindness of the country in the form of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, there are several schemes of the government and after the first scheme, the first scheme has to be stopped.
However, most of the people don't care about these things.
The old schemes continue to continue, the new schemes continue to continue, the coming schemes are awaited and it continues to continue.
In our country, there is no need of kerosene for households in which gas is used for cooking.
He has taken a big decision to free kerosene from Haryana.
I believe that Haryana will soon be free from kerosene.
Only mediators and teams will be hit by this.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has always been a guide for all of you.
The need of the hour is to look at the aspirations that have been created in the minds of the poor of the country.
We have to take one step to get out of the crisis.
Anything in our old thinking, the difference between the children and the daughters in the society should be eliminated.
Sudha in schools is now an independent tool for children and girls.
This is the opportunity for our daughters to experience India free of discrimination.
It is not right to spread darkness in Suddha village after the 21st century was destroyed.
The mission to provide electricity to these villages is being successfully implemented to free darkness at the earliest.
Successful efforts are being made to provide smoke free life to these five crore families.
Small traders, entrepreneurs, vegetable sellers, milk sellers, cane shopkeepers used to be stuck in the evil cycle of interest.
MUDRA Yojana, Stand Up Yojana and Jan Dhan Accounts have helped many people get rid of this bad cycle of interest.
Direct money is deposited in banks through Aadhaar so that they reach the real beneficiaries directly.
This is an opportunity to liberate the lives of the common man from the mediators and parties.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is 31st October and tomorrow is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great man of this country who dedicated his life to the unity of India.
You will be happy to have the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel on 31st May.
Sardar Patel spent his entire life in connecting the country and he had been successful in his campaign and brought together.
At the same time, Durdev said that on the same day Indira Gandhiji was killed.
We all know what happened in the country after their slaughter.
Sir, I want to ask what can be done to prevent such evil events
My dear countrymen, this is not just a person's sadness.
After Chanakya, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a big task of uniting the country.
This injustice on Sardar Jis birthday is painful for all of us. This injustice in history is painful for all of us.
However, we have to take into account all these difficulties and we have to go ahead with the mantra of unity.
The unity of diversity is the strength of the country.
Whether it is many languages, many castes, many types of food, but unity in diversity is the strength of India, the specialty of India is the responsibility of every generation.
It is the responsibility of every government to find and establish unity in every corner of the country.
It is important to save the country from the ideas that spread football.
It is our responsibility to make Sardar Saheb a India, it is our responsibility to make him a Best India.
The original mantra of unity is the strong foundation stone of Shreshtha Bharat.
The life of Sardar Saheb was started after seeing the struggle of the farmers.
However, Sardar Saheb took steps not only for the struggle but also for constructive work.
I pay homage to Sardar Saheb and urge him to remember and resolve unity wherever he is on 31st October on this unity day.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is a festival of light in this series of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev and his teachings and teachings are not only for the entire humanity but also for the entire humanity.
This was the message of Guru Nanak Dev, the message of service, reality and Sarbat Da Bhala.
Peace unity and harmony was his original mantra.
In every teaching of Guru Nanak Dev, a drive to free society from discrimination, superstition and evils was carried out.
Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Laloo as his colleague when he had reached the peak of the untouchable, racial, high-level disorders.
Let us move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' which inspires us to work against discrimination and inspire us to illuminate knowledge like Suddha Guru Nanak Devji.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to all of you on this Diwali, dedicated to the soldiers of the country.
My best wishes to you all for fulfilling your dreams, your resolutions, your lives in happiness and happiness.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you.
We lost eighteen heroes of our country in the recent terrorist attack in the Uri department of Jammu and Kashmir.
My dear countrymen, we have full faith in our armed forces.
They will imagine every such task and will embrace the efforts of 1. 25 billion people of the country to live comfortably.
But the armed forces are not speaking.
Today I would like to specifically talk to the people of Kashmir.
Now the people of Kashmir are well aware of the anti-national forces.
And as the truth has begun to know them, they have started walking on the path of peace by separating themselves from such ideas.
Every parents want schools and colleges to work at the earliest.
The farmers feel that the produced goods and fruits should go to the markets across India.
It seemed to be easier for economic transactions.
And for the past few days, this business has started simplifying.
We have to achieve new heights of development for our future generations.
I am confident that we can find solutions to every problem together, find ways and pave the way for the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the citizens of Kashmir is the responsibility of the government.
The government has to take some steps to maintain law and order.
I get the opportunity to know a lot of attacks through social media.
It provides an opportunity to understand and understand the feelings and feelings of every kind of people in every region of India and it strengthens democracy.
Harsh Vardhan, a young man who learned in the eleventh year, recently gave me a different idea.
Then I made a pledge that I used to study for three hours everyday.
It will be a citizen who will be useful for the country.
Harsh Vardhan Bhai, I am glad that during the emergence of the atmosphere, you can think so calmly at such a young age.
However, Harsh Vardhan, I would also like to say that the progress in the minds of the people of the country has a huge price.
He is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
This is a determination to do something.
Everyone feels like doing something or the other.
At that time Lal Bahadur Shastri had tried to touch this future of the country in an extremely excellent manner.
And by giving the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan, the common man of the country was inspired to work for the country.
One more way to express patriotism in the voices of bombs and guns was shown by Lal Bahadur Shastris.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T.
Kartik has written the Narendra Modi App that he created his brave history for the Paralympics competition and his sports is the victory of human consciousness.
Shri Varun Vishwanathan has written the Narendra Modi App that we should mention the work done by our brave personality in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only we, but every individual of the country has been associated with his sportspersons in Paralympics as an emotional role.
Beyond sports, this paralysis and the achievements of our sportspersons have transformed the vision of humanity and the vision of looking at the disabled.
And I cannot forget what your victorious sister Deepa Malik said.
When he won the medal, he said that this medal has defeated the disability.
There is a lot of strength in this volume.
At this time, 19 athletes had participated in the Paralympics competition with three women from our country.
In comparison to other sports, when the Divyangs play, the physical capabilities and the skills of sports are bigger than that.
You will be surprised to hear that our sportspersons have won four medals and earned two gold, one silver and one bronze medal.
Devendra Jhajriya, who won the Gold Medal, won the Gold Medal for the second time in the flag hoisting ceremony.
And she was not dying at the time of birth, because of the electric shock, she had to lose one hand.
Let us think that the person who wins the first gold medal in the thirty-twenty years of age and won the second gold medal in the thirty-five years of age, how much would he have done in his life
Mariyappan Thangavelu won a Gold in the higher variety.
He will not live in some big cities or even in the middle class.
In the 21st year of age, he gained medals for the country in the strength of his resolve, even though he had suffering from physical distress.
Deepa Malik has done a lot of wonder in the flag hoisting.
Varun C.
Bronze medals were won by Bhati in the higher variety.
Very few people will be aware of what kind of valour these Divyangjans have done in the Paralympics competition at this time.
Not only this, I was surprised when I came to know that the fourth player in the competition for the Divyang sportspersons could not get medals but he completed the race in less time than the sportspersons who won the gold medal in the powerful sportspersons.
I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving towards formulating an easy scheme for paralysis and its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a lot of wonderful experience in the Navsari of Gujarat.
It was a great emotional moment for me.
The Government of India had organised a Mahashibira for persons with disabilities and several worldwides were recorded at that time.
The world which cannot be seen, Gauri had come from the inaccessible forests of Shardul and Nang district and the entire Ramayana is in the form of poetry.
And when I heard the people gathered there, people were surprised.
On that day, I got the opportunity to inaugurate a book and collected the success story of the lives of the persons with disabilities.
This experiment was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Record .
It is a matter of pride for all our countrymen to have three-three universal vibrations from persons with disabilities on one day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we started the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on the same day I had said that cleanliness should be a habit, every citizen should have this duty, a climate of disintegration should be created for cleanliness.
Now, when two years are completed on October 2, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in 125 crore Indians.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today all of us can say that everybody has made an effort to move forward.
And that is why every person, whether it is ordinary citizen, government offices or roads, bus stations or railway stations, schools or colleges, religious places or hospitals, small children, senior citizens, rural poor, farmer women, everybody is contributing to cleanliness.
The media friends have also played a positive role.
I wish that we have to move forward.
And that is why if you want to tell about rural India then till date, about two crore and a half crore toilets have been constructed.
In the states and states, in the districts and in the villages, a small competition has been started.
Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will achieve complete success in Open Defecation Free Village Mission.
Congratulations and congratulations to those who have worked for this.
And I would like to urge the countrymen to free the country from this problem for the honor of mothers and sisters, for the health of children.
Let us move ahead with this pledge.
I would like to present a scheme for my young friends, especially those who use technologies.
By calling on this number of 1969, we will not only know the situation of building toilets in our city but also apply for construction of toilets.
We should take advantage of this, especially the younger generation should take advantage of it.
The Government of India has also called upon the corporate sector to move forward.
He should sponsor young professionals who wish to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the district as a representative of Swachh Bharat Mission.
Fertilizers have been told to buy fertilizers from waste.
The farmers who do organic farming have been asked to provide them fertilizers.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, those who take care of the health of the land, those who have suffered due to the use of chemical fertilizers, have been asked to provide these fertilizers as required.
And Mr. Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing specially to this work as a consulate messenger.
I am inviting the youth to start new start-ups in the field of West to Wealth, Waste to Wealth, develop machines and develop technology.
This is certainly the work of doing it.
During the period 25th September to 3rd October this year, a special event is being organized by Indoneson, Indian Sanitation Conference.
The Ministers, Chief Ministers, mayors of the metropolitan cities, the commissioners will meet together to discuss only cleanliness and cleanliness.
What could be the technology
What could be the economic policy
How can people-to-people participate
How can it create employment opportunities
All these topics will be discussed.
I see that new news about cleanliness is constantly coming up.
Recently, I read in the newspaper that students from Gujarat Technical University went to 170 villages and started awareness campaigns on toilet construction.
He worked hard and contributed to building nearly 900 toilets.
Recently, we must have seen that a team under the leadership of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh swim from Devprayag to Ganga Sagar 2800 kms and he gave a message of cleanliness.
Different departments of the Government of India have prepared their guidance.
Every department determines 15 days and pays attention to cleanliness.
In October, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Department of Panchayats, Department of Rural Development will jointly formulate a roadmap for sanitation in their respective areas.
And in the last two weeks of October, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Food Processing and Ministry of Consumer Affairs will implement the Swachhta Abhiyan in their respective sectors from 16th to 31st October.
I urge the citizens to participate in the departments of which you have a respectful relationship with them.
You must have seen a survey on the sanitation of the attack.
Earlier, in 73 cities, what is the situation of sanitation in the country was revealed to the people of the country.
Now this work will be done in nearly 500 cities with more than one lakh population.
Because the citizens of every city feel that we are lagging behind this thing and now I can do something better.
A competitive environment has been created for cleanliness.
I hope that all of us will contribute to this.
The birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri will be on 2nd October.
I urge you to buy Khadi from Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali.
I would like to tell you at this time that there should be only one thing of Khadi in our family so that the bankruptcy of the poor can be implemented in the house of the poor.
Would you like to participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan as a citizen on Sunday, October 2
Two hours and four hours, we will take part in the cleanliness work and I will tell you to take a photo of it and share it with the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, share a video.
See, your efforts will give a new strength to this campaign across the country, a new momentum.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, let us resolve to do something for the country.
My dear countrymen, the joy of giving it in life is different, no one should record it or not.
And the response that he received can be said to be an inspirational event in the national life of India.
Several youngsters, small institutions, corporate people, students, self-service organisations of our country will celebrate joy of giving in many cities from 2nd October to 8th October.
It is a mission to bring food items and clothes together to the needy.
It was a pleasure to see the game on the faces of those poor children.
I hope that in the cities where this joy of giving is going to be celebrated, we should encourage the youth and help them.
My dear countrymen, today 25th September is the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and this is the beginning of his birth centenary.
He worked to explain the political ideas that lakhs of workers like me are working with.
He highlighted the rooted politics of India, and said that India's cultural tradition is a vibrant vision.
The birth centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, which has given integral honorarium, is being started today.
The principle of self-interest is the contribution of Sarvajan Hitay-General Sukhai.
Mahatma Gandhi also spoke about the interests of every individual in the basement.
How will the fruits of development reach poorest of the poor
He presented the entire financial framework in two words, work for every hand and water for every farm.
My dear countrymen, I started Mann Ki Baat on Vijayadashmi two years ago.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the workers for the kind of appreciation and blessings of this programme on the completion of two years.
I also express my gratitude to All India Radio because he not only broadcast Mann Ki Baat but also worked hard to reach the listeners from all regional languages.
I express my gratitude to those listeners who wrote letters on Mann Ki Baat and put the doors of the government and showed the error in the work of the government. All India Radio took care of such letters and spoke to the government officials and provided a platform to solve the problems of the people.
That is why Mann Ki Baat was not only a fifteen-twenty-twenty-minute dialogue but also an opportunity for social change.
Anyone can have a greater pleasure than this.
How will the festival that connects human beings
And that power will be the means of real power and then we will celebrate the festival of victory together.
Let's take the mantra of unity and take the means of this power.
To take the nation to a new summit, let us celebrate the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja with peace, unity and harmony and celebrate the victory of Vijayadashmi.
PM addresses Mann Ki Baat on All India Radio
My dear countrymen, on August 29, Hockey's magician Dhyanchand's birthday.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day across the country.
I pay homage to Dhyanchand ji and also remember his contribution on this occasion.
He played an important role in winning Indias Hockey Gold in the Olympics Games in 1928, 1932, 1936.
All of you are aware of the name of Bradman for cricket lovers.
My countrymen, just as the time of Mann Ki Baat comes closer, the way My Govt or the Narendra Modi App is coming up.
There is so much awareness and awareness among Indians in other sports sports events without cricket.
He was a source of inspiration for giving this message to me.
Sachin says that in Mann Ki Baat of this time definitely talk about Indus, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar.
Girls got the medals you got.
Our daughters have proved that we are not less than anybody.
One of these girls is from North India, one from South India, some from East India and some from another part of India.
It seems as if these girls from all over the country have taken the name of India to brighten.
My Gover Peak Thakur wrote that we could have done better than this in the Olympics.
He said, Honble Modi, first of all congratulates him for winning two medals in Rio.
But I would like to take my attention to this thing whether our performance was good or not
And the answer is, no
We need to build a long run in the field of sports.
Our mother-in-law focuses on healthcare studies.
The society also believes that sports is timeless.
We cannot ignore that we are unable to achieve our expectations.
In some cases it has been said that those sportspersons who were doing good work in India, the sportspersons who were doing good work in India could not show them there and medals were only two medals in Tamil Nadu.
One more thing is true that if you don't get medals, you will realize that for the first time, Indian sportspersons have shown some good work in many sports games.
Look at the same time, his innovation in Nambaji was in fourth place and he got medals in a very little difference.
The same thing happened in Tennis, Sunya Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
After Ush, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar became eligible for the last round of the trackfield.
You will definitely be happy to see that after 36 years the women's hockey team reached the Olympics.
In the last 36 years, for the first time, the hockey team of men was successful in reaching out to the nack out feature.
Our team is strong and part of the Gamanti is that Argentina who won the gold medal, who lost the same in the entire competition, who defeated them
Some of the sportspersons were good, such as Adity Ashok, Dattu Bhokanal, Atanu Das...
My countrymen, we have to do a lot but if we do something and do something then your post will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
The Committee of the Government of India will undertake a thorough study and examine what is being done on sports worldwide.
The Committee will formulate a framework for what we can do well.
2020, 2024, 2028, we have to plan with a vision.
I also urge the state governments to set up such committees, what can we do in the field of sports, what can we do in each state, what should the states like one or two sports and how much strength can we show in that sports.
And I am confident that we have 65 per cent of the country's 65 per cent of the country's young population, we will together achieve the best position in the sports world.
This resolution has to be followed.
Friends of the country, Teachers Day on September 5
I have been giving time to the students on the occasion of Teachers Day for a few years and I was spending time by becoming a student of them.
I was learning a lot from these students too.
For me, September 5 was the Teachers' Day and the Day of Education.
Therefore, there is a thought in the mind that you should express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat.
The place which Mother has in his life is also the place of teachers.
I have also seen teachers who are more concerned than themselves.
They live their lives for their disciples, students.
At present, after the Rio Olympics, Pullela Gopichand is discussing all over.
They are sportspersons but they are examples of how the best teacher is.
The contribution of teachers is always felt in the lives of all of us.
On September 5, the birthday of former President of India, Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, and the whole country considers this day as a Teachers Day.
Even though he reached any place in his life, he tried to live in the role of a teacher himself.
That is, in such a beautiful signature, and my own letters are very bad.
And there was a good signature for whom I saw that respect increases in my mind.
If you have photographs with your teachers Narendra Modi App, you will remember, if you are inspiring then you must share...
Keep in mind that the contribution of teachers from the point of view of the students will be valuable for you.
Friends, Ganesh Festival will come in a few days.
Our country, our society, our family, every individual and their lives should be disintegrated.
When we think of Ganesh Festival, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak.
The tradition of public Ganesh Festival is to be given to Lokmanya Tilaks.
Through this, there should be discussions on the topics that touch the social life and the creation of programmes should be such that the society should get new inspiration, new brightness and the self-reliance given by them is my birth rights and I will be able to achieve it.
Today, Ganesh Festival was organised not only in Maharashtra but in every corner of India.
Discussions on public issues, essay competitions and sequence competitions are held.
In this way, social subjects are touched through a artistic fashion.
As soon as the campaign for a kind of public education begins through the Ganesh festival, Lokmanya Tilak gave us the inspirational mantra that Swarajya is my birth rights.
Now we have the right of Suraj, let us move towards Suraj, let Suraj have our priority. Can we not give the message of this mantra from the Ganesh Festival
I invite you.
It is true that festivals are the power of the society.
Festival brings a new consciousness in the individual and society.
Life is impossible without festivals but it is expected to change it as per the demand of time.
On this occasion, I have been reminded that some people, particularly on the Ganesh festival, Durga Puja, have written a lot and they are worried about the environment.
The idols made from POP are not environment friendly.
Others have also spoken of this pain in a rapid manner.
I pray to all of you that like ancient times, use the idols of the goddess Ganesha and the idols of the mother Durga and do not follow our old tradition.
The conservation of environment, conservation of our river ponds, protection of small animals from pollution is in a way God's service.
I don't know what kind of feeling we will take on these issues, but I don't say it alone but many people have the same opinion.
Some people believed that the idol of Pune, Abhijit Dhondfale, Kolhapur's institution - Nisarg Mitra, Science Prabodhini.
Environment friendly Ganeshotsav is also a social service.
Durgapuja has a lot of time.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be possessed with saints on 4th September.
Mother Teresa had dedicated his entire life to the service of the poor of India.
Mother Teresa, who served the poor people of India throughout his life, gets a saint's recipe, it is natural for all Indians to feel proud.
The event will be held on 4th September in which a delegation of officers under the leadership of the Government of India, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will take place on behalf of 125 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, when development becomes a mass movement then there is a big change.
Jan Shakti is the form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to bring people together for clean Ganga and Ganga in collaboration with the five state governments.
On 20th of this month, the leaders of the villages on the banks of the Ganges were invited to Allahabad.
I convey my best wishes to all the chiefs who came from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for coming to Allahabad for this resolution and whoever comes from Jharkhand and West Bengal.
I congratulate all the Ministries and Ministries of the Government of India who have realized this idea.
I also congratulate the Chief Ministers of all the five states that they have taken a definite step in the cleanliness drive of the Ganga by bringing together the manpower.
Someone wrote from English and somebody wrote from Hindi and somebody wrote from Chhattisgarh that there should be toilets in his house.
He called for toilets.
Some children have written that this year I have not celebrated my birthday but I must make toilets.
This work was done by these children from seven to seventy years of age.
It had such an impact and an emotional impact that on the second day when we went to school, the parents wrote a letter to the teachers and assured that we should make toilets in the house till one day.
Congratulations and congratulations to those who have made this idea, to those who have tried for this purpose, to congratulate the parents for their efforts and decided to construct toilets with their hearts.
One daughter Mallama of the sixteen years of this district called Satyagraha against her family.
Look at the features of the village head Mohammad Shafi
He deposited eighteen thousand rupees and built toilets within a week.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has been the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have a resolution.
Some Indians have made their goals.
However, everybody has been linked to it or not, everybody has contributed to it.
Everyday news is coming - what are they trying
The Government of India asked the people to make a film on cleanliness for two-three minutes and send this short film to the Government of India.
I would like to tell TV channels that we should also fill up such competitions.
The idea of innovation can also strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan.
I am inviting you all, my countrymen, India has always been keen to have a relationship with neighbouring countries.
However, this is not a channel of ordinary radio, it is an important step.
Our neighbour is Bangladesh.
You are aware that Bangladesh and West Bengal are today connected with the same cultural tradition.
He will interact with each other and exchange ideas and enjoy the AIR of both the Bengali speakers.
All India Radio has played a major role in connecting people.
The President inaugurated the Channel.
I thank Bangladesh for working with us for this programme.
I convey my best wishes to all the friends of All India Radio that they are contributing in foreign policy as well.
My dear countrymen, we have given me the smoke of Prime Minister's post but in the end I am a man like you.
Sometimes emotional events touch me too much.
Some such emotional events also give new energy, inspiration and inspire the people of India to do something or the other.
A 84-year-old I-G retired teacher, he wrote to me a letter.
I feel like not declaring my name but tell them the name.
In his letter, he said that we had requested to leave the gas subsidy and then I forgot it.
However, a few days ago somebody of us came and gave me a letter and thanked me for the Give it up.
This letter of Prime Minister of India for me is not less than Padmashree.
Friends, We have tried to give a letter to those who left the subsidy on LPG and somebody will give it to me.
I am trying to give letters to more than one crore people.
He wrote to me that you are doing good work, your campaign to free the poor mothers from the smoke and I will be a retired teacher in a few years.
I am sending a loan of Rs. 50,000 which will help the poor mothers to get rid of the smoke of chicken.
You are aware that a mother who retires from a general teacher's pension, who gives Rs. 50,000 for gas connections to poor mothers, the question is not about Rs. 50,000.
The question is of the emotions of that mother and the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters, which strengthens the faith in the future of my country.
He did not write this letter to me as Prime Minister but wrote a simple letter: Modi Bhaiya
Flood situations occurred in some parts of the country.
The state government, the central government, the local institutions, the social institutions and the citizens as much as possible.
In August 2016, all the political parties, the parties, which are not losing one opportunity against each other, passed the GST Bill together.
Its credit goes to all the political parties and it is an example of how big it was when all parties started walking together.
Similarly, in relation to what happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together raised a voice.
Those people who try to make such small children comfortably, they will have to answer it sometimes to the innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is big, it is driven by diversity.
As a citizen, as a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen these things that will strengthen unity and only then will the future of the country be bright.
I have full faith in the power of 125 crore people.
This morning, I got the opportunity to stay with the youth of Delhi for some time and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports will color every young man with zeal and hope.
You all know that in a few days there will be a big sports gathering in the world.
The name Rio is going to be repeated in our ears.
Your hopes will be very much, but the sportspersons who have gone to the rio are the self-confidence of 125 crore people in the country.
We should do something or the other to encourage our sportspersons from wherever we are in the coming days.
The sportsperson who reaches the Olympics reaches there only after hard work.
This is a kind of hard penance.
Winning and greening are important but it is more important to reach the sports sports sports sports sportspersons and therefore convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons who have come to the RO Olympics.
Today, I am talking about the Rio Olympics, a poem lover, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay, a student from Punjab Central University, has sent a poem.
Many of you will be poets, those who have written poems, even if they write poems, some people will do it in every language, but the poems that Suraj has sent me are sharing with you.
This young man has reminded me of the death anniversary of former President Abdul Kalam ji.
The whole country and the world had paid homage to him but whenever the name of Abdul Kalam ji comes, the words of science, technology and missiles come and the pictures of the future Supportable India come to light and hence Ankit has written that what is your government doing to realise the dream of Abdul Kalam ji
Ankeet ji is right to say you.
And if we want to go with it or go beyond it, then we should create research and innovation and these two are the souls of technology.
If research and innovation are not there then the way the accumulated water produces foul smell, the technology also remains a burden.
If we are under the guise of old technologies without research, innovation, then the government has taken some steps to sweeten the attraction of science, research and innovation in the new generations to become timeless in this world, in the changing era. And therefore, I say, Let us take the goal of innovation.
And I say let us innovate, then I mean AIM.
10 lakh rupees will be given to those schools where such tincture labs will be constructed and Rs. 10 lakhs will be given to take care of them for five years.
On the other hand, India is blaming many problems.
We see problems and problems in everyday life.
Now we have to find technology-based answers.
We have called upon the younger generation of the country through the Atal Grand Challenge that if we see problems and problems then find it through technology, research, innovate and take it to us.
The Government of India is encouraging you by giving special awards to the technologies that deal with problems and problems and I am happy to know that people are interested in it when we told about the Tinkering Labs.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, we were worried about the drought and the news of the floods is also coming in these days.
The state government and the central government are working shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to help the flood affected people.
Even though there are some difficulties due to rains, everyone's mind is happy, the human mind is happy because the centre of our entire economic upheaval is rain and the farming that is going on.
Sometimes such diseases occur that we have to repent for birth .
But if we remain aware, be cautious and striving then the way to escape from it is easier.
However, we are sometimes slightly sad in terms of action.
The government, hospitals and doctors will not only do their work but I urge you to be aware of not getting any disease from water so that we do not even enter our households, in our departments and in our families.
Friends, Dear countrymen, I want to take care of one more crisis.
Today life has become very fast, because of continuous running, we don't get time to think about ourselves.
If the patient falls sick then it feels like healing at the earliest and antibiotics are taken for it.
We don't walk through shortcut.
Complete the course of those pills .
Even after leaving the incomplete those bacteria will be beneficial , even then the bacteria will be beneficial , hence the course of taking pills has been proved in those days .
It is compulsory to complete the course, but it is necessary to complete the course.
In the medical language it is called antibiotic resistance that how to use antibiotics should be followed by its rules .
In the last decade, there has been a sudden decline in maternal mortality rate but even today, the lives of pregnant mothers cannot be saved in a large number.
The deficiency of blood during pregnancy , the infection occurring during delivery , high blood pressure , no distress of any kind of problem in their life .
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has launched a new campaign called Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Matritva Abhiyan.
Through this campaign free check up of the pregnant woman will be done at the Government Health Centre on 9th of every month .
To protect the lives of both mothers and children, I urge women specialists not to serve the poor mothers on 9th.
Can't my doctor brothers and sisters give 12 days of a year to the poor
There are thousands of doctors, they wrote the same letters as they had taken forward the work by accepting my appeal.
Thousands of doctors are such that they believe me.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worrying about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is being discussed in a collective manner in the country and the world.
Shukracharya Niti has said that there is no such vegetation in which there is no medicinal properties.
Those who donate the trees, they also preserve the trees in the world like them.
But in today's generation, there are some people who follow these ideals and conduct them.
The discipline mountain of Mahabharata has said that trees also perform the responsibility of the child in the world and gold has taken the opportunity to fulfil the desires of not only our parents but the entire society.
Khandu Maruti Mahatre, a farmer from Narayanpur village in Junnnar taluka in Pune, Maharashtra, has inspired in a different inspirational way.
The temples should start the tradition of planting in the warm rainy season .
Tree plantation can be a mass movement easily.
I consistently tell the farmers that if we damage the land due to dams on the edges of our farm then instead of dams, can we cultivate timber or wood
Today, to build houses in India, to make wood goods, buildings of crores of rupees have to be brought from abroad.
If we plant such trees in our farming fields, which would be useful for the work of wood and houses, we can also sell it by the permission of the government after fifteen-twenty years, we can get the new means of income and we can save India from importing wood.
In the last few days, the Government of India has recently agreed a CAMPA (CAMPA) legislation in several states using the climate change and more than Rs. 40,000 crore funds will go to the states for tree plantation.
I was told that the Maharashtra government has planted 125 crore trees in the entire state on July 1, and has resolved to plant 3 crore trees next year.
The government has created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Desert-Bhumi has done a big jungle festival and has resolved to plant twenty five lakh trees.
Twenty five lakh trees in Rajasthan are not small .
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they can know how big they have taken up.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase 50 greenery by 2029.
This work has been started by the Railways in the Green India Mission launched by the Central Government in the Green India Mission.
There is a bright tradition of Suddha Forest Festival in Gujarat .
This year, several projects like Amravan, Ekta Forest and Shaheed Forest have been taken up under the One Festival and a campaign to plant crores of trees in Gujarat.
I cannot mention all the states but everyone is eligible for appreciation.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa a few days ago.
Whenever there is a foreign visit, there is talk of international policy trade, there is a discussion on security, there are some MoUs.
But for me, the journey of South Africa was like a pilgrimage in a way.
South Africa said that it is natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
When the words of non-violence, love and immortality come to the ears in the world then the faces of Gandhi and Mandela Hai come in front of us.
During my visit to South Africa, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
His visit will always be remembered.
Equality and equal opportunities are not such a big mantra for any society and government.
Both the paths of equality and mood lead us to a bright future.
We all hope for a good life, want a good future of children, everybodys needs are different, but the roads are the same and it is the same for development, equality, equality, equality and equality.
Come, let us be proud of these Indians who have shown this original mantra of life in South Africa.
He informed me about an incident, Prime Minister ji, I am speaking from Bangalore to Shilpa Varma.
A few days ago, I had read an article in the newspaper that a woman smuggled and slaughtered e-mail and losed Rs.
As a woman, I was sorry about it.
I want to know your thoughts about this.
Everyone knows this thing that if you know the things that fascinate us on your mobile, e-mail, then there is a message to hypnotise that you have been sorry for so much money, you should pay so much money and take so much money.
Some people are fascinated and some are fascinated.
These technologies are spreading all over the world.
Sometimes we also feel fascinated.
I feel that we should be cautious of this fame, be aware, if such a defectful news comes then we should tell them in our friends and councils and they should be cautious.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to meet many people during the Parliament session.
Our MPs bring people from their respective departments, meet them, tell them about themselves, tell them about their problems.
But I had a pleasant experience in these days.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
The zeal of children and daughters was worth seeing , they had brought a big album with themselves .
Artificial paintings have been carved and painted at the station.
You must go to Aligarh and see this station .
This is an example of the transformation of peoples participation.
Thanks to all those who have done this kind of work in the country, special congratulations to my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with the rainy season, there is also a season of festivals in our country.
Festivals are celebrated in the temples and pilgrimages.
You are also being connected to the festivals outside the house and home.
Rakshabandhan is a special festival of our stature.
Whether we cannot give Rakshabandhan festival this year as a gift to the mothers and sisters of our country as Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana
Think, visit the sister so that her life will be safeguarded.
Moreover, we can also present the Saksha Bima Yojana or the Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan to the women who have made food in their homes, who have cleaned their homes, who have a daughter of poor mothers.
My dear countrymen, many of you are those who were born after independence and I am the first Prime Minister of this country who was born in independent India.
You can inspire us to give 75 years of uit India and 70 years of Indias independence. You can create new zeal and hope and this can be an opportunity to do something for the country.
The festival of independence is not a government programme but it should be the countrymen.
It should be our festival like Diwali.
I hope that we will also do something good to connect with the inspiration of patriotism.
My dear countrymen, I am fortunate to interact with the people of the country from the Red Fort on 15th August.
Something that will be there in your mind, you will like it, you will be able to demonstrate it from the Red Fort.
Whatever thoughts you would have come in your mind, you would feel that as your representative, as your prime servant, you should tell me from the Red Fort, you must write me and send me some suggestions and suggest new ideas.
Let me invite you, let us remind you of the brave martyrs who have laid down their lives for India and let us go ahead with a pledge to do something for the country.
Once again I have got the opportunity to make Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat is not a ritual for me.
I am keen to interact with you myself.
And I am happy that I can reach every corner of India through Mann Ki Baat to the common man of the country.
I express my gratitude to All India Radio for the successful efforts made by the All India Radio to spread the translation of Mann Ki Baat in the regional languages at 8 pm.
And I am glad that the citizens who listen to my Mann Ki Baat programmes will reach me through a letter and through MyGov website and through the Narendra Modi App.
I am beneficial to carry out the suggestions made by the government.
How active should the governance be for public welfare
How much priority should the work of public welfare be given
For this, my interaction with you is very important.
World Environment Day is on 5th June.
Environment is discussed around the world and care is being expressed.
The theme of the Environment Day is ero Tolerance for Illigel Wildlife Trade, which will not only discuss the trade of wildlife but also speak about trees and water.
The reason for this is that you might have seen that in the jungles near the Himalayan foothills of Uttarakhand, Himachal and Jammu and Kashmir, there was a recent storm in the forests.
Therefore, saving the forests and saving the water is the responsibility of all of us.
He interacted with the Chief Ministers of each state for about two to two hours.
Barkai heard what to say to them.
Some states, particularly Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, have used technologies.
We have to reach out to other states of the country through NITI Aayog.
In order to overcome such problems, public participation is the main reason for success.
And therefore, water storage is equally important.
And that is why drop More Crop - every drop - more production, micro-irrigation - micro-irrigation, low-water pike.
It is a matter of happiness that sugarcane producers in many states are now using micro-irrigation and micro-irrigation.
From him, I also came to know that many states have great goals, particularly Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat, three states have done a lot of work in the field of irrigation.
They are trying to bring two to three lakh hectares of land under micro-irrigation every year.
If this mission is implemented in all the states then it will not only benefit the agriculture but will also increase the storage of water.
Our brother-in-law Mission Bhagirathi in Telangana has tried to use the water of Godavari and Krishna rivers in a better way.
With the help of technologies, efforts are being made to recharge ground water through Niru Pragati Mission in Andhra Pradesh.
In Maharashtra, people are providing financial assistance along with labour.
I am sure this movement will really be useful to protect Maharashtra from future water storage.
The State of Chhattisgarh has taken up the Jansurajya-Jalsurajya Abhiyan.
A massive campaign has been taken to revive the archaeological canals of Rajasthan and Gujarat.
However, in some parts of the state there is a stagnation of water.
There a big work is being done by constructing chequehams and small bonds.
This is really a pleasant experience.
But there is a lot of water therefore we remained unconscious and after the end of the monsoon there is no water therefore how will it go
And water is not limited to the farmers.
This topic is related to the villages, the poor, the workers, the farmers, the urban, the rural and the poor.
Therefore, when the rains are coming then water should be our priority and how much water we saved during the rainy season this year when we celebrate Diwali.
We will see that our joy will increase manifold.
And this is not just the government, the political leader but the common man's work.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a modern India.
Our India is going to be transparent.
Those who are going to reach India from one end to another in a similar way.
We have to change our old habits to do this.
Today, I want to touch a topic in which you help me, we can successfully move towards that direction.
But now the time has changed.
The entire world is moving towards cashless society.
Through electronic technology, we can get money and send money.
There is no fear of stealing your pockets in this field.
He will be registered on his own.
Initially it will be a little difficult to use this method but once it is a habit, this system will be easier.
This is possible because in the last few days, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana was implemented, the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country were opened.
On the other hand, Aadhar number has also been found and mobile is now in the hands of almost every Indian in India.
Therefore, Jan Dhan, Aadhar-Mobile-JAM (JM).
We can move towards cashless systems and cashless society by coordinating with this.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been provided with the Jan Dhan account.
In the coming days, it will be useful for both card credit and debit.
And a small machine has also been made available in the attack, which is P.
O.
It is called the Point of Cell, through this machine, you can pay for others using Aadhaar numbers, RuPay cards.
One of the initiatives taken by the Government of India is how to provide money through POS
The second initiative we have taken up is that bank on mobile.
Exchange of money through your mobile phones will be very easy.
In a way, this is the step taken by the bank in this direction.
Movements are also being made to provide bank services to the post offices.
If we learn to use these methods and practice them, then there will be no need for direct currency, there will be no need to withdraw money.
Behaviour will continue to happen on its own and will help in transparency.
Absolute behavior will stop the behaviour of two numbers.
The impact of black money will also be reduced.
Therefore, I will urge the countrymen to start this thing.
You can see that once this system started, we should move forward in a smooth way.
Is there anybody liked 20 years ago that so many mobiles would be in our hands
Gradually the habit of staying without it is not possible .
It is possible that cashless society can be gradually shaped in the same way .
But it will be better if it comes to light in a short span of time.
We must encourage our sportspersons participating in the Rio Olympics and increase their confidence.
He was a candidate for the post of Chief Minister.
But he was also the Minister of the Government of India at the same time.
Whether they get nutritious food according to requirement or not .
Whether they want to be trainers for their physical health or not .
I am happy to see that whether the results of the elections or the possibility of responsibilities as the Chief Minister, I am so aware of your work as a sports minister in such a situation.
Our sportspersons feel that when 1. 25 billion Indians are standing with you, this will become a big force and their self-confidence will reinforce.
Last time I had taken the topic of the FIFA Under Seventin World Cup.
I have received information from all over the country and at this time I can see that the football environment is being created all over the country.
Many people are preparing their own teams by taking initiatives.
I have received several information about the Narendra Modi App.
It is possible that many of them would not be playing but I had a pleasant experience of sports in the minds of thousands of youngsters in the country.
The relationship between Cricket and India is fond of you, but I have seen how much interested in football
Everything should not be counted as victory and defeat.
With sportsmanship, India should create its identity in the world.
I urge the countrymen to do something to create an atmosphere of enthusiasm for their partners associated with the sports sector.
In the last eight-ten days, new results are coming from anywhere.
I am not talking about the results of the elections. I talk about those students who have been studying net throughout the year.
It is now clear that the results of the 10th-Baravi have begun to come together and our daughters are singing the valour.
It is a matter of joy.
We must move forward with confidence.
But I have come up with a rapid new question and I have never thought of it.
I was very fond of reading this.
He said that when I went home with a mark of 89. 33 per cent, I felt that I would be appreciated and a year of congratulations on all sides.
But I feel like a burglary on my mind.
I have read your letter of pride and I feel that this pain can be not only of yourself but of millions of students like you.
Because the atmosphere has become such that the error has been discovered more than enjoyment.
This is the second form of negative spirit.
I would like to urge the people of the neighbours and the parents to welcome the results that your children will take.
Otherwise, there will be a day that you will get 100 qualities and even then someone will say that it is true that you have got 100 qualities but it would have been better if you have done Amook-Amuk.
Therefore, it is necessary for every thing to have a limit.
Santosh Giri Goswami of Jodhpur also wrote a similar letter.
He says that the people close to him are not ready to accept their results.
They say that something else has been done better and something else has been done better.
I would like to tell you so much that in such a situation you do not let yourself balance.
Everyone expects, listen.
Be steadfast in your determination and try to do something better.
But if you don't accept satisfaction about what has been achieved then you will never be able to create a new thing.
And therefore I will urge you to sing the singing of the success that has been achieved.
Those who don't get good quality in the field of sports, goes forward in the field of music, goes forward in the field of arts and goes ahead in business.
God has given some skills to everyone.
Just recognize your internal capabilities, focus on it, you will make progress in your life.
There was a time when Santur Wad was an integral part of the folk music in the Kashmir Valley.
But Pandit Shivkumar, who handled this plaintiff and today he became an important player in the field of global music.
In the field of Sanai-India Music, Sanai was limited.
During the period of kings and kings there was a place of sanai near the entrance of the court .
But Ustad Bisimilla Khan took this word and kept Sunai at this height of the best of the world.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I remember that the expenses incurred on medicines in the poor families of our country are causing the slide of the family.
And it is true that the cost of not getting sick is very less but after getting sick, health is like before but it is very much spent.
Why shouldn't we have our lifestyle that we don't have a disease and we don't have any financial burden on the families.
One means, keeping cleanliness is the most important way to keep away from the disease.
Who can do the biggest service of the poor is cleanliness.
And secondly, the topic for which I constantly urge is Yoga.
Some people also call it Yoga.
21st June is the International Day of Yoga.
There is an attraction, devotion and the world has accepted it all over the world.
This is an invaluable gift to our ancestors, which we have given to the world.
The stress-affected world gets the strength of living a balanced life from yoga .
It is easier for the people associated with Yoga to be healthy, to be balanced, to create a strong will in mind, to concentrate in every work.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just a programme.
And sometimes a collective atmosphere can change the life of a person.
I hope you will definitely do something about this on June 21.
The culture of the entire office changes and the environment changes.
Can we use 21st June for Yoga in our lives
Can we do yoga in our social life
I urge you not to stay behind.
We are healthy, it is very important to make India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I am constantly connected to you through Mann Ki Baat.
Several days ago, I had given you a mobile number and we could listen to Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call.
But now it has been made easier.
We will be able to hear Mann Ki Baat by giving a missed call on this number.
Namaste.
We are determined to do many things during the holidays.
The programme comes up and during these holidays, the season takes place in the form of pomegranates that it feels like taking the taste of mango that if a bit of left-wing is done in the afternoon then it will be rubbed.
But this time, due to heavy heat, we have enjoyed this pleasure.
It is natural to have an environment of care throughout the country.
And whenever there is continuous drought in them, water storage stops.
Sometimes due to invasion, sometimes due to invasion, sometimes due to storage due to obstruction, water storage in the reservoir is less than the capacity.
And the water storage capacity is decreasing for years.
However, I have seen that the citizens also make very good efforts for this.
In many villages, awareness is seen and the real cost of water is known as those who have faced the crisis of aquatic storm.
And there is a sensitivity to save water and there is also an activity to do something about it.
A few days ago, I was told that the Hivere Bazar Gram Panchayat of Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra and the villagers of Maharashtra have taken up the issue of water in a very sensitive manner.
He decided not to harvest crops like those who need more water, pomegranate or banana.
It feels very easy to hear but it feels that it is not as easy.
What a big pledge must have been made by everyone together
He took initiatives on Tushar Irrigation, Storm Irrigation, Water Storage and Water Supply and therefore, today this village is standing on its own to overcome water shortage.
I would like to tell you about this small village of Hivere Bazar but I congratulate all those villages and those who have many villages and their best work.
He built nearly seventy-five fields.
As a result, the level of ground water has increased, the level of water has risen.
He said that when crops need water, they get water and they are very big.
The income from agriculture has increased by 20 percent.
Increasing water levels not only saved water but also improved water quality.
However, many such initiatives are being implemented by the citizens who never come forward.
If the government has implemented a good campaign then sometimes it gets fame but if we look around you then you will be able to see how people try to find ways to overcome this problem through new measures to overcome the drought.
It is a man's nature that whenever there is a lot of troubles, even if there is a good thing then it is a feeling that all the troubles are removed.
This is likely to be 106 to 110 in the rainy season everywhere and this news has received a message of peace.
There is still time for rains, but the news of good rains has been brought to light.
Can we take a campaign to save water in villages from now on
The farmers need soil and they are useful for crops in the fields.
If we take the silk of the village then it will be beneficial for the farming and the capacity to store water in the bottom will increase.
There will be water in our wheels.
Today we are facing water crisis and there is a situation of drought but the next month and a half is in our hands.
Their concerns are natural because this work has been going on for nearly 30 years.
A lot of money was spent for several governments and several schemes.
Ganga gives us luck, Ganga gives us employment and gives us a new energy to live with the Ganges.
As the Ganga flows, it gives a new momentum to the economic activities of the country.
One Bhagirath has brought us the Ganga but today crores of Bhagirathis need to save it.
This campaign will never be successful without public participation.
Several efforts are being made at the government level.
Efforts are being made to collaborate with the states that are on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to participate in social and voluntary organizations.
Several steps have been taken to keep the flow of Ganga, to keep the surface of Ganga clean and to prevent industrial pollution in the water of Ganga.
In the utensils of Ganga, everyday dense waste flows through the canals.
To clean this waste, the work of cleaning water waste at Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna is done with the help of trash scheme.
It has been requested that all local administration institutions have been made available and they should use it to clean the garbage.
And recently, I was told that where these efforts are being made well, there are three tons of waste everyday.
That is, it is true that such a large amount of dirt has been stopped from growing.
In the coming days, plans have been made to set up a trash scheme at some places and people living on the banks of the Ganges and Yamuna will soon be able to experience it.
In order to prevent industrial pollution, a work plan has been formulated with paper-leaf industry, liquor manufacturing factories and sugar mills.
I still feel that it will have good results.
The evacuation of wastes falling from paper factories is now on the way to close.
This is the symptom of the fact that we are taking steps in the right direction and in a way awareness has also increased.
And I have seen that not only those living on the banks of the Ganges, but when a person from the southern part of the far-flung visits me, he would definitely say that the Ganga will be cleaned.
This belief of the common man will achieve the success of the Ganga Cleanliness Mission.
Citizens are giving donations to clean Ganga.
This work is going on in a good way.
My dear countrymen, today 24th April.
This day is celebrated as Panchayat Raj Day in India.
On the same date, the Panchayat regime started in our country.
And gradually the Panchayat Raj system spread across the country is working successfully as an important part of our democratic governance system.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Dr. Ambedkar on his birth anniversary on 14th April.
I got the opportunity to bow down to that holy land and today on 24th April, I will celebrate Panchayat Raj Day in the state of Jharkhand, where our tribal brothers and sisters live in the highest number.
And at 3 pm, he interacted with all Panchayats across the country.
This campaign has done a big job to create awareness.
How will democratic institutions be empowered at the village level in every corner of India
How will the village be self-reliant
In some villages, foodgrain initiatives have been taken.
The awareness that has come from the villages is the same India-Uday.
The base of India-Uday is Gram Uday.
Therefore, if we focus on Gram Uday then we will not be able to achieve the desired results.
Shermila Gharpure from Mumbai called and expressed concern over her.
I am speaking from Mumbai to Sharmila Gharpure.
I have a question about school and college education.
There has been a need for reforms in the education sector for the past several years.
No availability of proper schools or colleges or the quality of education .
Children do not know many basic things even after completing their education, so that their children are left behind in the world.
What are your ideas about this
Today, the biggest dream of mothers in every family is the education of children.
I believe that the parents should be worried about how to teach and educate children, how to get good education, and I believe that the families in which this awareness is felt, the impact of this awareness is seen on the school.
Every government in our country has emphasized on education and every government has made efforts in its own way.
However, the more important it has now expanded is the reforms in our education system.
We have done a very big work of expansion.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Now quality education from the Literacy Campaign should be our priority.
Today, we have to pay attention to the framework that has been calculated.
How many children have come to the school, preference was seen till date.
Now we will have to focus on those children who have come to school, they will get good education and proper education.
You must have seen in this government's budget as well as an effort has been made to give good education.
In this budget, you will see 10 government universities and 10 private universities being freed from government control and asked to come up at a challenging, competitive level.
Say that we want to work for the best universities and best universities.
This scheme has been implemented with the objective of giving them complete freedom.
At the same time education has the importance.
For the past few days, citizens have been asking me about one issue.
He wrote on the web portal MyGov, some people write my Narendra Modi App and most of the youth are writing in it.
Honble Prime Minister Namaskar, I am speaking from Bijnor to Mona Karnwal.
Apart from education, the sports sector is also very important for the youth of today.
They should have a consciousness and a good leadership so that they can develop inclusively.
I would like to encourage the maximum number of youth and the government should also encourage NCC, NSS and India Scouts and Guides.
One day I came to my mind that before talking to you, you should talk to all these boards.
And when I asked them when such a meeting was held earlier, they answered that this is the first meeting of the country since independence.
Therefore, I express my gratitude to the youngsters and young friends in the context of all these works.
A lot of work is being done at your own level, but if our organisations work in the form of a collective and organised form then it can have a great impact.
And there was a zeal in them too, to do something and now it is true that I was myself a NCC cadet of the National Cadre Army.
I have got the benefit of this childhood and I also believe that there should be a new consciousness in such organizations.
I had a few issues in this meeting.
Several things have been spoken to him.
Several young organisations are working with you, what can be innovated in their activities and programmes
If you have written this Narendra Modi App, then I will reach the right place and I believe that after this meeting all these things will get a speed.
I believe that it will also come to your mind to incorporate themselves with all these things.
My dear countrymen, I have to tell you one thing that you will forget to think.
I believe this is a matter of awakening all of us.
You must have seen that the state of our country is such that during the last several elections, what kind of gas cylinders will be given to the party.
And if every political party had to reach the middle class people by the way of elections, then the gas cylinder is an important topic.
This is a universal experience.
But it was never thought of going out of this framework.
Today, my countrymen, I am happy to share my share in front of you.
I chose a different way and that was the way to believe in the masses.
Sometimes we have to believe in our people more than the political leaders believe in themselves.
My dear countrymen, this is not a small thing.
In our country, grants were denied while the equation was the right.
I would particularly urge all the political classes to say today that at least one thing we should do to believe in people everywhere.
We will get the result that we have never thought.
We have to go in this direction.
And I always feel that as I have come to my mind, why should I take a child for third and fourth class jobs
Believe those who have been examined and have received qualities.
Sometimes I also feel like let us announce that there will be no ticket testing on this one line of the train.
It comes to my mind that there can be no government rules but it can create an atmosphere of confidence.
And there are no political leaders who have created this environment, they have been prepared by one crore families of the country.
Every breaking news on every newspaper and news channel is painful.
Is there not a good thing happening around us in this country with a population of 100 crore
Please change this situation.
Ravi ji has expressed his keen condolences, but I feel that this anger is not of me but of the situation of loss.
You must remember that our former President Dr.
I have seen the attack that some television channels make positive news special time.
In today's times, a positive news environment is being created.
Everyone wants to get good news and good news.
It is true that the greatest person, the best thing, the best things, the best words and the best ways will be said, the more the impact of this thing is the best news of the positive news.
It is true that if we put a lot of emphasis on goodness then we will not have a lot of place for bad things.
Blindness will be removed by lighting.
And that is why you might have decided that the website called Transforming India has been started by the government.
It is not only the government but also the citizens.
And this is the portal on which we can send a good news of yourself.
You can contribute.
Ravi ji has given good information but please don't follow me.
The Kumbh Mela is the specialty of our country.
Kumbh fair can become a center of attraction from the point of view of tourism .
Very few people of the world knew that for such a long time, millions of people come on the banks of the river.
Celebration is celebrated in the peaceful and peaceful environment .
In the context of such events, in the context of the management of programmes, people are going to create new parameters in terms of participation.
For the last two days, I have seen that many people are uploading pictures of Kumbh.
I believe that the tourism department of the Government of India should compete with the tourism department of the state government and urge people to take up the best pictures.
Not only should cleanliness be there but the people who return from there will take the message of cleanliness.
I believe that Kumbh is a religious and spiritual fair but we can convert it into a social festival.
I am glad that in the same way, the things of your mind have linked me with things. Once again many thanks.
Mann Ki Baat is always awaiting me and you.
I have seen a lot of letters, letters, phones, information and inspirations. Everyone feels a feeling and feels a feeling. And there is a lot in this thing that I have to include but I have a limit of time.
However, I would like to share the same thing with you once again in the threshold of Mann Ki Baat.
You must have remembered that last time I had discussed some of the books of Premchand ji and we had decided to share some of the books that you read through the Narendra Modi App.
Some people have advised me to talk about some more books.
But I should acknowledge that I cannot give time to save books on a large scale.
But one advantage is that I get the opportunity to know about the subjects of several books that you write and send.
However, from the experience of the last one month, I feel that we have to take this initiative forward.
We have made a corner of the books on the Narendra Modi App and when we read a new book, write it there, discuss it and you can also suggest a good name for the corner of these books.
And I am feeling that today the minds of Indians have been solved on the subject of water.
Several effective efforts are being made across the country for water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods.
Media has launched several innovative campaigns on water conservation.
Whether it is the government, the NGOs, they are doing something or the other on the battlefield.
The rural people have worked to give a definite direction to a waterfall that flows from the mountains by working hard.
And that is also a pure indigenous method.
This has not only prevented soil dust and crop losses, but also water is being provided to the farmers.
You all will be happy to know that the beautiful state of the North-East, Meghalaya, is the first state in the country to formulate its water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, the crops which cost less water are being encouraged and the farmers do not have any harm.
Several fairs are held on the occasion of festivals.
Do not use these fairs for water conservation
People from every section of the society go to the fairs.
In these fairs, we can give a very effective message to save water, to fill the exhibitions, to play drama, to deliver the message of water conservation in a very simple manner.
In fact, the World Children Winners Games were organized in Moscow this month.
This is a sports competition in which the youngsters who have escaped from cancer are those who have come out of their lives fighting cancer.
In the event, competitions such as namebazi, intellectuals, swimming, running, football and table tennis were organized.
All these 10 winners of our country won medals in this competition.
Some sportspersons have won more than one medal.
Sanjiv Haripura of Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Mahendrakumar Dada of Kolkata, P.
A lot of people from different parts of the country have written to me Narendra Modi App and MyGov and have urged me to discuss Chandrayaan-2 in Mann Ki Baat.
In fact, the year 2019 vision of space progress has been very well for India.
Our scientists had left ASAT space in March and thereafter Chandrayaan-2.
However, there was no discussion on big and important events like ASAT in the electoral process.
We have achieved the capability of launching a satellite at a distance of 300 kilometers in just three minutes with the help of ASAT missile.
India became the fourth country in the world to achieve success and now on 22nd July, how did the entire country move from Chandrayaan-2 to Sriharikot in space
The photographs of Chandrayaan-2 filled the countrymen with respect and joy.
Chandrayaan-2, this mission is special in many ways.
Our understanding of the Chandrayaan-2 Moon will make it clear.
This will give us more detailed information about the moon but if you ask me what two big things have I learned from Chandrayaan-2, then I will say, these are two things, Feth and Fearlessness.
We must believe in our talent and capabilities, and believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to hear that Chandrayaan-2 is completely Indian.
He is an Indian in both heart and spirit.
The entire indigenous system is a drive.
When there is talk of innovation in new fields, our scientists are the best and are of global standards, this mission has once again proved.
The second important factor is that there is no need to be afraid of any crisis.
It is unprecedented that the methods that our scientists, in the record time, in the night, have left all the technical questions and have left the Chandrayaan-2 space.
All the world saw this great penance of scientists.
It should be a matter of pride for all of us and the time to reach Chandrayaan has not changed.
Sometimes we have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but keep in mind that the ability to defeat them was in itself.
I am confident that the Chandrayaan-2 Mission will inspire the youth of the country to innovate science and innovation.
In the end, science is the path of development.
Now we are waiting for the month of September, when lander-vikram and Rover-Pragyan will land on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I invite the youngsters and young friends of the country to inform them about a very entertaining competition - a quiz competition.
I urge the young friends and students to participate in this quiz competition and make the competition more entertaining and memorable.
I specially urge schools, parents, enthusiastic chief teachers and teachers to work hard to win their school.
The most thrilling thing is that the Indian government will take the most qualified students from every state to Sriharikota and in September when they land on the surface of the Chandrayaan Moon, they will get the opportunity to witness the moment.
This will be a historic event for these victorious students, you will have to participate in the quiz competition, you will have to achieve maximum qualities and you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have taken a look.
Our Mann Ki Baat has given an impetus to the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time and the efforts made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago today is setting up new standards of cleanliness with the participation of many.
We have achieved an ideal situation in the field of sanitation, not only in the roots but the way we have achieved the success from villages to public places in the field of sanitation, it is the power of the resolve of 130 crore Indians but we will not stop here.
This campaign is now moving ahead from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, in the media, Yogesh Saini and his team were watching the story.
Yogesh is a military engineer and has left his job in the United States and has returned to India to serve Mother India.
He took up the task of making Delhi not only clean but also beautiful.
He started with his team from the wastelands in Lodhi Garden.
Through street art, many parts of Delhi are decorated with beautiful paintings.
When they started showing their art from the walls of the Overbridge and the school to the slums, people also got the support and in a way this silsila started.
You must be remembered that during the Kumbh Mela, Prayagraj used to decorate the paintings on the road.
I realized that Yogesh Saini and his teams played a very big role in it too.
The sound of colors and silks cannot be heard, but the message of the indradhanush that is produced from them can be more effective than thousand words and we also experience it in the beauty of the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of waste to wealth in our society.
If we want to tell you one thing then we have to move forward towards making gold from garbage.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a very entertaining response to My Gov.
This was the response of Bhai Mahmod Aslam, who lived in Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote, It is good to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am happy to say that I played an active role in organizing the Bank to Village of Community Mobility Programme in Jammu and Kashmir in my state.
Also, there should be an online monitoring of the programme.
I believe that this was the first such programme in which people had directly interacted with the government.
Brothers and sisters, Mohammad Aslam ji sent this message to me and after reading it, my eagerness to learn about the Bank to Village Programme increased and when I got detailed information about it, I felt that the whole country should be aware of it.
This programme imagines how much the people of Kashmir are eager to connect with the mainstream of development.
Literacy, gender quality, health, sanitation, water conservation, electricity, water, infrastructure education, senior citizens' questions were discussed.
Friends, This programme was not just a government formality but the officers returned to the village throughout the day but this time the officers had also taken a two-day camp in the Panchayats and they got the opportunity to stay in the village.
The sports competition was held for children under Khelo India.
Sports literature, MNREGA job cards and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribe Certificates were also found there.
The people of Kashmir participated openly in this festival of development.
It is a matter of happiness that in the remote areas like organizing the Bank to Village programme, the government officials had to go to the far-flung roads and climb the mountains sometimes one day and sometimes one-and-a-half days.
The officers also visited the border panchayats where the borders are constantly afraid of the bulletbare, not only did the officers go to the extremely sensitive areas of Shopian, Pulwama, Kulgam and Anantnag districts.
Some officers were so heavy that they stayed in the village for more than two days.
It is very pleasant that a large number of people should participate in the villages of these regions and make plans for themselves.
It is also obvious that people are trying to create hatred in the path of development, they can never succeed in our family objectives.
My dear countrymen, honoured by the Gyanpeeth Awards, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendra has presented the month of Shravan in one of his poems.
In this poem, he has said, Hodige Madige is adventurously married, the land of Adrag is mugna. That is, the bonds of rain and water streams are nearby and the earth is immersed by seeing their beauty.
In the whole of India, different cultures and speaking people celebrate the month of Shravan in their own way.
Whenever we look around in this season, we feel as if the earth has weared a greenery shawl.
A new energy is transmitted everywhere.
In this sacred month many devotees visit Kavad Yatra and Amarnath Yatra, while some fast regularly and wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nagpanchami.
During this period, the festival of Rakhi Purnima, a symbol of brother and sister's love, also comes.
If the discussion of the month of Shravan is going on, then you will be happy to hear that more and more devotees have participated in the Amarnath Yatra during the last four years.
Since July 1, more than three lakh pilgrims have seen the sacred Amarnath cave .
More than the devotees who had participated in this journey for 60 days in 2015, have participated in this event in just 28 days.
I also compliment the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
The people who come back from the journey are filled with the feelings of love and affection of the people of the state.
All these things will prove to be very beneficial for tourism in the future.
I have been told that in Uttarakhand too, since the beginning of this year, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham in a month and a half months.
For the first time, after the severe disasters in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I urge all of you to visit areas where natural beauty used to be seen during monsoon.
To see the beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, there is no greater teacher than tourism and pilgrimage.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for this beautiful and comfortable month of Shravana to communicate with new energy, new hope and new hope.
Similarly, the month of August brings memories of the uit India Movement.
I would like to make some special preparations for 15th August and find a new way to celebrate this festival for independence.
When we see TV, we see only one aspect of the rains - all over the country we will have to leave ourselves with families to see the floods, stored water, transport drains and other paintings enjoyed by the monsoons.
Rain, freshness and joy both freshness and happiness bring together us.
My dear countrymen, how to start Mann Ki Baat, where to stay, there was a lot of difficult task but time limit.
I convey my best wishes to all of you on this occasion.
My young friends, you are busy in the examination.
Today, we are very much awaiting the co-operation between India and Australia.
India has won the fight against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The time has come to bring about a new revolution in this sports world.
And you can see that a nutritious environment is being created in India for football, hockey, tennis and junk like cricket.
You might have realized that India is hosting the FIFA i.e. FIFA i. e.
24 teams from all over the world are going to play in India.
On the other hand, I see the attraction of football in the youth, be it EPL, Spanish Ling or Indian Superlig.
To know about these things, they take time to see them on television.
How will the competition of governance, educational institutions and social organisations to connect themselves with sports
We see that all this has been done in the field of cricket.
However, we have to prepare the same environment for other sports.
This is a Golden Jubilee to identify India.
My dear students, you must have decided to visit tourism during these holidays.
And I came to know that the work that we did not get to our tourism department, our cultural department, the state governments which were not able to do and the government of India have not been done by crores of tourists of the country.
India is full of diversity.
Perhaps there will be no such district in India where I have not gone.
I specially congratulate Coal India.
And I am glad that nearly ten thousand citizens have visited the coal mines of Sawaner near Nagpur as a tourist.
Some efforts are being made from both tourists and tourists living in tourist places .
Efforts are being made not only in the scientific system but also in the same way.
Would you like to pay special attention to this thing as well
I am sure my young friends will definitely help me in this work.
It is possible to create huge employment through the tourism sector.
India is far behind in comparison to the world in terms of tourism .
But if we decide to focus on the tourism sector, then we can attract the world towards India.
The biggest part of the world's tourism sector can attract our country and create employment opportunities for millions of youth of our country.
Whether it is governance or institution or society or citizen, we all have to work together.
Let's try to do this.
My young friends, the slaughter has come and I don't like this.
If you don't swim, you will decide to learn to swim in these swimming pockets.
If the cycle is unable to drive then the cycle cannot be cycle in these slabs.
Even today, while typing on computer I do with two fingers, why should not I learn to typing cleaner
There are many skills for our personality development.
It will increase so much that you will see that after the start of the school, after the start of the college, you will go back there and tell your friend that in this holiday, if you don't learn anything then you will say that if you don't learn anything.
My time was left, but you have learned new things.
Friends, this will be discussed mutually.
Many information has been received on MyGov in Mann Ki Baat.
My name is Abi Chaturvedi, Namaskar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji.
During the last summer holidays we had told that the leather also suffers from heat so that they keep water filled in a balcony or glass in a vessel for chewing .
I have done the same and I am happy to tell you that this has made my friendship with the gentlemen.
He called me and reminded me of a magnificent work.
Last time I was remembered and I had said that during the summer, keep the parties filled with water in the mud utensils outside.
He told me that he does this throughout the year and he has been friendly with many other dignitaries.
Mahadevi Varma , the great poet of Hindi literature , had a lot of love for birds .
He had written in his poem that he would not let you go away, fill the courtyard with donors and fill the hod with salt and sweet sweet salt.
Let us also do this thing that Mahadevi had said.
I congratulate and thank you for taking into account a very important issue.
Have we ever given them water in the days of summer
I express my gratitude to you for craftsmanship and you have given a sensitive subject in a very simple manner.
Yes, it is a habit in India.
However, I express my gratitude to Barkai for seeing this craft.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you must have heard of Digital India.
Some people feel that Digital India is the world of the youth of the city.
But this is not the case.
You will be happy to hear that a Kisan Facility App has been prepared for your service.
If you download the Kisan Facility App in your mobile phones then you will get a lot of information about agriculture and climate easily.
I hope that my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Facility App on their mobile.
My farmer brothers and sisters, summer is the time of holidays for others but summer is the time for the farmers to sweat.
He waits for the rain.
The time before the commencement of the direct season of agriculture is very important for the farmers.
But our countrymen should also think that what will happen to us by drinking water.
The water storage in the ponds, water flowing drains, water flowing ponds, where some waste has been stored or some has been invaded, the water flow stops and consequently the water storage decreases gradually.
First of all, if the water was saved in the rains, the lake was filled, the river was filled with drains then even if it was not rained then it would be less harmful to us.
You must have seen that we have decided to produce 5 lakh farming fields.
Emphasis has been laid to create water resources to store water through Manrega.
There will be so many villages across the country, so many progressive farmers, so many aware citizens who would have done this thing.
However, there is a need to do more work today.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Today I will tell you one thing that the Government of India had recently organised a grand exhibition on agriculture.
I saw how modern technology has been cultivated in it.
However, it is yet to reach directly to the fields.
Now the farmers are also engaged in reducing the use of fertilizers.
This mantra should be followed by the use of scientific methods and the field of agriculture should be carried forward.
I hope that we will fulfil our determination in the next one or two months to ensure water conservation.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
Victory on Diabetes is a declaration of World Health Day this year.
It is said that in 2014, the institution of diabetes patients in India was up to 1. 5 crore.
3 percent of the deaths due to death were found to be diabetes.
The entire world is worried about diabetes, so on 7th April, the concept of victory over Diabetes on World Health Day has been decided.
We all know that our lifestyle type-2 is the main cause of diabetes .
If we like yoga then do yoga.
Otherwise do at least walking , running exercise .
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
We sometimes hesitate to test health.
And it is reflected in the fact that diabetes has veined our body a long time ago.
This means that this is such a disease which can be tested quickly .
My dear countrymen, you have been doing a lot of work in this regard.
I would like to urge you to tackle TB or diabetes.
And therefore, I urge all of you people to get rid of tuberculosis to overcome diabetes.
On 14th April, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti.
His 150th birth anniversary was celebrated all over the country.
A Panchteerth- his birthplace in Mahu.
In London, where he took higher education, Nagpur where he took initiation.
I am fortunate to visit Mahu at the birthplace of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Baba Saheb has given you a lot to be a good citizen.
By following the path shown by him, we can pay homage to him by becoming a good citizen.
In the last few days, Vikram Savtsara will start and new records will be sensitized.
They are celebrated in different states in different ways.
You can listen to your mobile phone.
We just want to give a missed call.
Let's make a missed call, do it according to your convenience.
If you want to listen to the earlier programme of Mann Ki Baat then you can hear it and you can hear it in your language.
I will be happy to be with you through this.
My dear countrymen, many best wishes to you all.
How can this World Cup increase the interest of sports among the youth of India
Let us also participate in this.
He sent photographs of such places, photo uploaded that he was really happy to see them.
If you want to see the vision of Shauk-e-Didar Hai, if you want to see the vision of the vision of the vision.
They should wish to reach the place where no one has gone before.
Western Coal Fields Limited, Savaner Sthal near Nagpur is located in coal mines.
When people visit tourist places then they buy something or the other .
Even if he is poor, he will pay something and if he is a rich person then he will spend more.
I give you an issue to think.
Would we collect a new art and a skill in our personality to achieve a new thing
Why should not you increase your strength
Do you like to paint but do not come
Hey, let's start, let's go.
For personality development, to learn new arts, to enhance skills, make use of holidays.
There are innumerable areas.
Craft Kuke of Mysore has put a sensitive issue in front of all of us.
If you ask them a question, they answer it and explain it to you.
And once you use it, see what is your use in it
And yet, if there is something like that, you should complain to me about it.
Let's save water in villages.
How to save the drops of water in the coming rains
How will the water of the village be in the village
I welcome this idea.
We have made our land sick due to hypertension of fertilizers.
But if you use the best spice basumar then would you like to eat food
They don't like that food.
But today we have become careless about tuberculosis.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, you are listening to my Mann Ki Baat on radio.
Your minds will now have the idea of the examination.
I also want to join you in this journey.
As much as you look at your children's examination, I feel the same.
But if we change our vision to look at the exam then we can become anxiety free.
In the background of my Mann Ki Baat programme, I had told you that you should send your experience and your information to me Narendra Modi App.
I am glad that the teachers, the students who have achieved great success in their lives and the beneficiaries of the society have written a lot of things to me.
Today I want to talk to my parents, students and teachers from Mann Ki Baat programme.
Whatever I have heard, what I have read and what I have been told, I will tell you something about it.
But I am confident that the students who are going to face the examination will certainly be useful for this 25-30-minute interaction.
My dear students, before I talk to you, today's Mann Ki Baat was started by a well-known Opener in the world, what would they be useful to achieve the summits of success in life
Their experience will definitely be useful to you.
I know that the examination will start in a few days.
Some of you will be under stress.
I have the same message.
Your mother will expect you, your teacher will keep you, other members of your family will keep your friends.
Whenever you go anywhere, how is your preparations going on in all thoughts
How much qualities do you get
When I was playing the cricket, I had a lot of hope from me.
In the last 24 years, there were many difficult moments and several times there were good moments.
But the expectations of the people were always there and as the time has been moving forward, the hopes have also increased.
And for that I needed to find a solution.
Then I thought that I had my own expectations and set my own goals.
My attention was focused on Chandu and then all the goals were achieved by you people.
Friends, What was Tendulkar ji saying
Don't be buried under the burden of expectations.
You have to make your future.
Why should you spend your time to compete with others
You will see that no one can stop you from moving ahead and if you have achieved greater success than the success that you have achieved earlier, then you will not need to depend on anyone else to gain joy and get satisfaction.
You will experience self-confidence.
Friends, Do not consider the sports of tests, qualities and data.
Where did we reach , how much did we get
Don't stop in this discount.
This is known from these tests, whether our activities are correct, it is understood by these tests.
And that is why if your dreams are immense, then the examination will be a festival of joy in itself.
And therefore, what will happen this year
Do not keep yourself limited in such a way .
Move ahead with a great goal in front of your eyes and even if you get less than expected success, you will not feel disappointed, you will be inspired to make more efforts with greater zeal and strength.
Thousands of citizens have written small issues from my app and their mobile phones.
However, throughout the year, 365 days should be favourable to our daily routine, our dreams and concepts.
Mr. Prabhakar Reddy gave me an opportunity to sleep in the morning and urge me to rise early in the morning to expel the study.
Prabhakar Reddy said that the testing centre should be reached on time with entrance and other essential things.
I couldn't have done the courage to say this because I am not very serious about sleeping.
And many of my friends are complaining that I don't take enough sleep.
During the examination, I would like to talk about sleeping to test you in a state of stress free.
Don't you do this
I am sure, I will not do it.
The discipline in life is an important reason for the foundation of success.
Not only this, daily routine also worsens.
And so don't understand anything small.
Please decide, look at it.
The negative effect of the stress that is under this stress falls on their results.
And on the strength of the study that I have done, I will solve any question paper with confidence and I will leave the question papers with determination.
Let us know from them the path of achieving success by giving a bright light to this exam.
Namaskar I am Vishwanathan Anand.
Let me begin with my best wishes to you for the examination.
Now I will tell you how to go to my examination and my experience about it.
I knew that the exams are similar to the problems that come after your presence.
You should comfortably take a calm sleep at night, you should eat your stomach, you must not be hungry and the most important thing is that you should remain calm.
All this is like the left of the intelligence force.
When you are playing, you don't know what kind of thirst is going to come up, you don't even know what kind of question is going on in the examination.
That is why if you stay calm and you have eaten a lot of stomach , you have got sleepy then you will know that your brain remembers the right answer at the right time .
That's why it was calm.
Do not give much stress to yourself , do not keep very hopeful .
This is important, look at it as a challenge - what I have learned in a year can I solve this question
In the last moment, revive the most important thing, remember what you don't remember, while examining you, you will probably remember some issues along with teachers or students and this will help you remember a lot of things about that.
If you emerge as a tough question, you will be aware that they are new questions for you and then when you give a test, you will be able to solve it better.
So keep calm. Take a good sleep at night, do not show much confidence but do not remain disappointed at the same time.
I have often found that these examinations are better than you were afraid.
And while playing international intelligence, you must have seen them how they sit firmly.
It is a matter of fact that it is difficult to say so, but efforts should be made.
If you don't talk to friends, you go alone, stay like a comfortable gall, you cannot quit your mind for the last minute.
If the water is calm then even deep things can be seen but if the surface of the water is melted then nothing below is visible .
At that time one feels the inner tension .
Then I feel that if you do some rest then it will be better.
For that I have developed a mechanism myself.
I breathe deeply, breathe deeply, breathe deeply three times, five times.
It takes 30 seconds, 40 seconds or 50 seconds for all this, but after this my mind becomes calm and my mind is prepared to understand the subject.
My experience will also be useful to you.
Rajat Agarwal has said a good thing.
Whatever my app writes, at least half a day, we should spend time with our friends and families in happiness.
And what do you do
Friends, don't do this.
If you ever have visited somewhere with your mother-in-law then remember that moment, get out of practice and examination and give it for at least half an hour.
It is a matter of understanding that Rajat ji had said.
Friends, Shall I tell you about Peace
Before you have been tested today, a person has sent a message of taxation that is basically teachers and today a meaningful version has been teachers.
He is trying to connect Ramcharit Manas with this great scripture with the present era and convey these editions across the country and around the world.
The venerable Murari Bapu has described the students as a club.
Friends, I would like to tell you one more thing today.
G.
However, one thing is certain, be it a student that Yoga is a Gurukilli in the journey of development of the interpretation of life.
Take care of this.
I have full faith in it.
My young friends, do you have a lot of time to go to the examination centre, do you feel like going back and sitting on your back
Otherwise by this there is tension in the mind .
If you understand these information then you will not have the time to regret.
I have also seen that the form of a question paper has changed and this question paper is known when it comes in hand.
Shri Rao has highlighted the issue of patience in his message.
Even in minimum words, the beautiful message of Kamali has been sent by Rao Saheb.
R.
Rao speaks.
I am fully aware that the tests also cause restlessness due to competitive examinations.
Don't care.
I would like to tell all my young friends to give you the best.
But at the same time, keep in mind that there are many other opportunities available in this country.
Decid what you want to do in your life and do not leave it. You will be successful.
Don't forget that you are the lake of this world, like trees and mountains, you have the right to stay here.
You need it for gratitude, dedication and dedication.
These qualities will make you successful in testing and other efforts.
I convey my best wishes to you for what you want to do.
Several blessings.
In the past, how is a scientific method of telling the issue
Whatever it takes for me for half an hour, he tells me in three minutes.
This is the power of science and this is the power of scientific mind.
I am very grateful to Rao Saheb for inspiring children from all over the country.
He spoke of Dedication, Determination, Diligence.
Friends standing firmly remained firm.
If you stand firmly then you will feel afraid too.
And the golden future will wait for you to be cultured by you.
Ruchika Dabus has sent a message to me.
And this is true, Sachin ji also said that positive approaches and positive conditions of mind are created by this, positive energy.
Sometimes many such things will inspire us, do not think that only the students get inspiration.
At any moment of life, on any turn of life, on the best liberality, the truth inspires us and gives us a lot of inspiration, and at the time of crisis, we can find a new path on the strength of this motivation.
We read information about Thomas Alva Adison, the father of the Divyang Divyang of Electricity.
Friends, Have you ever thought of how many years he spent in this research and sometimes he had to suffer waste, time was spent and money was spent.
However, he had not taken any special education in the subject of mathematics but also emphasized on various areas such as mathematical categorization, statistics.
K.
Rolling himself had said that this power was important for him.
In today's times, the examination is not only of students but also of all families, schools and teachers.
Vijay Jindal has said that the parents do not put the burden of their expectations on the children.
And by seeing this, we are not only drowned but we like to get hands with them.
We also want to progress at the pace of science.
This is because today is the National Science Day.
He became the Standard of the Nobel Prize for this discovery.
And in his memory, we celebrate 28th February as National Science Day all over the country.
Curiosity is the people of science.
In every mind, every generation has to focus on scientific ideas, every one of the attractions of science and innovation.
New research is not possible without the participation of science and technology.
Today, on National Science Day, new innovations should be encouraged across the country.
"I am Sir C.
Friends, Sometimes it takes a lot of time to achieve success and when success is achieved then our vision of looking at the world also changes.
You must have heard that science has been discovered in the past few days.
Scientists from all over the world worked hard, many generations came, they put some emphasis on it.
The discovery of the principles of the great scientist Iinstein of the last century was not only strengthened but also a great discovery in the field of physics.
It is a matter of fact that the entire humanity will benefit the whole world.
It is a matter of pride and joy for us to be an Indian who shared our country's sons and skilled scientists in this entire research process.
In the coming days, our scientists will make efforts to take this new innovation forward.
India will be a part of international efforts.
And my countrymen, recently a significant decision has been taken in this regard.
The Government has decided to set up a Laser Interfameter Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) in India to find out the next step in this research.
There are two such centres in the world, the third will remain in India.
The participation of India will give this process a new strength and a new momentum.
India will be actively involved in this great scientific discovery of human welfare on the strength of limited resources.
My dear countrymen, I tell you one number and tip it.
You will be able to hear Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow by giving a missed call on this number.
You can hear in your mother tongue too.
The number of missed calls is 81908 81908. I will reiterate 81908.
Friends, Your exams are going on. I also want to examine tomorrow.
125 crore Indians are going to take my test.
Just tomorrow, I was tested that you will start your paragraph.
And the country will be successful only when we all succeed.
Then, friends, I congratulate you all.
Being free from the stress of success and unbelievable, go ahead with a free mind.
In the last consignment Mann Ki Baat, I have spoken two things.
Recently, we have celebrated Christmas festival and now we have started preparing for a new year's reception.
India is driven by diversity.
Festivals are roaming around .
Sometimes it feels that India is a country whose economy is based on festivals.
What is the greater joy of the world be it terrorism, global temperature rise, natural crisis or human-made, humanity, happiness and peace
You know that I use technologies a lot, I get a lot of information about various topics.
I always see the portal MyGov.
People go to different places to celebrate Christmas holidays .
Tourists in the field of tourism are given special attention but Sawishwarkar says that where there are tourist spots, dharamshalas and religious places, there should be special focus on cleanliness.
And even then, we say that the guests will come to our houses and we will clean up the house and decorate the house.
Therefore, we should pay special attention to keeping cleanliness in our tourist places and religious places.
Deep Singh Malviya lives in Bhojpura village in Sihore district of Madhya Pradesh at the age of one year.
I felt that it came to me to read and reach you.
Deep Singh Malviya, who lives in Chhotiasya village, decided that if someone provides toilets in the village then he will not be able to work for construction, he will make toilets free.
Assuming that construction of toilets is a sacred work, Dilip Singh built a hundred toilets in Bhojpura village.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Deep Singh Malviya.
This country is progressing at a rapid pace because of the duration of many people.
When every Indian knows that all people are attracted to Yoga, and the whole world celebrated International Day of Yoga and when the world is connected then our minds believe that this is our India.
Whenever we had a glimpse of a huge form then this belief and belief is created in our minds.
The topic of sanitation is now being discussed at home in a way.
Their participation increases.
The benefit of this thing is that the government employees who do this thing to provide electricity to the villages will get satisfaction and the work of changing the lives of a village will be enjoyed by the media, whether it is the farmers or the poor or the women or the youth.
They have the right to get the work done by any government and to ensure that no government has done any work, they have the right to get it.
All of us should try to reach the right things, good things, things that are being used by the common man.
Doing this is a service in a way.
I have made a small effort on my own.
I cannot do all this alone, but when I tell you, I should do anything or not.
We have to reach 125 crore Indians.
How can I reach without your help
In the language of the common man, we will reach them and inspire them to get their rights.
My young friends, on 15th August, I had made a primary discussion about the theme Start-up India Stand-up India from the Red Fort.
After that, in every account of the government, every department of the government, the work started.
Can India become a global capital in terms of start-ups
In a new way, with new innovation, start-ups will be an opportunity for the youth of our states, be it manufacturing sector, service sector, agriculture sector.
In every case, new ideas, new experiments and new efforts need to be innovated and the world will not move forward.
Start-up India, Stand-up India scheme is a big opportunity for our youth.
My young friends, on January 16, the Government of India will present a complete work plan for the Start-up India Stand-up India scheme.
But it is not at all, we have to change it as per the requirements of India.
Our young friends hope that a poor person makes a penalties, or organises a person's labour lightens.
I urge the State Governments to take steps in this regard.
On 16th January, I will talk to you in detail.
I will always welcome your information.
Dear young friends, 12 January is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Like me, millions of people of this country have inspired Swami Vivekananda.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as the National Youth Festival from 12 January 1995.
The event will be held at Raipur in Chhattisgarh this year.
I know that this year's theme is the Indian Youth of Development, Skill and Hormoney.
Accessible India Day was celebrated in his school with a telephone commemoration of Sulabhaskar Bharat Diwas.
When Yoga comes to meet those people who work in the society then there is a lot of thought in their minds.
Now it is true that every word has such a different significance.
This year, I was going to visit the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan which was launched by the Government of India this year but I was not able to attend the programme of Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan in some districts of Tamil Nadu, particularly because of the Mahapur in Chennai.
But I was thinking of going to that programme.
I felt that in our country we should use the word "Divyangjan" instead of the word "Divyangjan".
These are those people who have only or more parts in which there is divineity, there is a transmission of Divya Shakti which is not like us.
I liked this word very much.
Now the citizens of my country will preach the word Divyangjan instead of Disabled
I hope that we will take this idea forward.
We have started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan on that day.
Implementation of the required infrastructure reforms directly and indirectly and facilitate the people of Divyangjans.
Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus depots, railway stations have ramps, ease parking, accessible enterprises, brailleps and so many things are there.
They like this.
We should also participate in this process in your own way.
My dear countrymen, the government schemes continue to come and continue, but this scheme is not just artificial but it has to be conscious.
We have to reach the last portion in a better way.
They should not breathe in the files .
Because these schemes are being implemented by the Government of India a few days ago to provide the benefits of the scheme to the common man, to the poor and the needy.
The subsidy is given to the gas cylinders in our country.
This amount is worth Rs. Crore but we do not have the system to ensure that it has not reached the beneficiaries in time.
The government has changed it a bit.
The biggest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme in the world was implemented with the help of Jan Dhan Bank Account and Aadhar Card and the amount of subsidy was deposited in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.
I would like to proudly tell you that as the worlds largest and successful Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme, this initiative has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records.
This scheme is known as Pahal.
By the end of November, about 15 crore LPG holders have become beneficiaries of Pahal scheme.
This subsidy has been directly deposited in the bank accounts of 15 crore people.
There is no need for any of the recommendations, there is no possibility of corruption.
On the one hand, Aadhar Card, Jan Dhan Accounts, and on the other hand, the State Government and the Central Government, together with the list of beneficiaries, connecting them with Aadhar Number and Accounts Number.
A few days ago, MNREGA, which provides employment opportunities in the villages.
There were many complaints about it.
I am sure about 35 to 40 schemes are now being incorporated under Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26 January is a golden moment of the Indian Republic Day.
The centenary of the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar is the silver festival.
In the Parliament, a two-day special discussion was held on the Constitution and it was done in a very good way.
We must continue this initiative that all the parties discussed the sacredness of the legislation, the importance of the legislation and the understanding of the original legislation of the Constitution.
Can you do the work of connecting people with power and power with the people on Republic Day
The Constitution has given you a lot of rights. It should always be discussed and it should be done.
It is our sacred duties to vote all around during the elections.
The way our duties are discussed at the time of voting, why not happen in the lives of eternal times
On the occasion of the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, on 26th January, what is going on to organize essay competition, poetry competition and synonymous competition in schools, colleges, villages and societies in the city
If 125 crore Indians move ahead with a duties, then a great history can be achieved.
I want to know your thoughts.
Send your article on my portal MyGov.
I would like to know what the younger generation thinks about the duties of my country.
And I don't speak this at the government level.
We build the statues of great men with great devotion, but then we are desperate to take care of them.
On the other hand, preparations for breasts will also be started.
Festivals have a special importance in the society.
Sometimes this festival fountains on sadness and sometimes gives a new look.
But sometimes during these festivals if there is any problem then it is very painful .
There are frequent natural disaster reports from every corner of the world.
There are reports of natural calamities that we have never heard or thought.
We are now feeling the impact of climate change at a rapid pace.
In the last few days in our country, the kind of rains and rains have occurred in the last few days and the kind of damage has occurred in Tamil Nadu and other states have also been affected.
Many people died.
I convey my condolences to all those families in the accident.
The State Governments work with full strength and help and rescue.
The central government also always works shoulder to shoulder.
At present, a team of Government of India has gone to Tamil Nadu.
I am confident that even after this crisis falling on Tamil Nadu, he will once again start moving forward with confidence and the role he plays in the development of the country will be overcome.
However, when we see the crisis around us, we need to make a lot of changes in it.
15 years ago, natural calamities were part of the agriculture sector as natural calamities were confined to the drought.
Today the form of this is changing.
It is necessary to increase our capacity at every level.
For this, the government, the society, the citizens and all the small institutions will have to work with the point of view of science.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I interacted with the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif and suggested that the SAARC countries should jointly study a joint study to prepare for disaster response.
I am glad that the SAARC countries' discussions and workshops on best measures were held in Delhi.
There is a good beginning.
Lakhvinder Singh called me from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
I am speaking from Jalandhar district of Punjab, Lakhvinder Singh.
We do organic farming here and guide many about this farming.
I have a question that those people who set fire to pulses or wheat plants in the field do not remember how they can guide the microbes in the earth to die and how will they get rid of pollution in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab
I am very happy to hear your questions.
Happiness was first because you are a organic farming farmer and you are not only doing organic farming yourself but also the problem of the farmers.
Your concern is going on but it is not just happening in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of people from all over India and in the traditional way we burn the remains of crops in the same way.
But the pain you have expressed is right.
First of all, we should train our farmer brothers and sisters in this regard and explain to them the situation of truth that if the remaining remains of the crops are burnt then the time and hard work will be saved and the next crops will be produced.
But this is not true.
We destroy it but if we make these ruins small pieces then it will be a dry fodder for the animals.
Secondly, after burning it, the upper layer of the earth burns.
My farmer brothers and sisters, think for a while that our bones should be strong, our heart should be strong, our kidneys should be good, but if the skin of the body burns then what will happen
We cannot live even if the heart is good .
The way the skin of our body burns then it is difficult to stay alive , similarly the skin of the damaging mother burns not only on the skin network of crops but also burns .
Animals will not only be used as fodder but they will not only save their land but if the fertilizer produced in the same land then there will be double benefit.
The water in those skins is sufficient for that crop and today their skins have also got the price.
They are now getting income from these knees too.
Today, those knees that had to be spent for cleanliness have also been the means of income and demand for them is increasing.
Friends, Dear countrymen, the upcoming 3rd December will be celebrated as International Disabled Day all over the world.
27th November was celebrated as "Indian Organ Donation Day".
Many eminent personalities including film actor Ravina Tandon were present on the occasion.
Due to organ donation many valuable lives can be saved .
Organ donation gives immortality in a way .
When an organ from one body goes to another body then that organ gets a new life but that person also gets a new life .
What can be the best of this
A National Registration on Patients, Organ Dents, Organ Transplants has been launched on 27th November.
I am confident that there will be widespread awareness in this area too and the needy will get the best help because this help cannot be achieved until any organ donates.
As I said earlier, December 3 is celebrated as Disabilities Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped people are also adventurous and capable .
When such persons are neglected then they suffer.
Sometimes a mercy is shown on them.
But if we change our vision to see them then we will know that these people can inspire us to live a life.
You can inspire to do something.
If there is a small crisis on us then we cry.
Then you can remember that the crisis on me is very small.
How will they live their lives
How do you work
And that is why all these are inspirations for you.
The power of their resolve, their way of living, and the power to reverse the crisis is also worth giving it.
Javed Ahmed, I would like to tell him today that it is 40-42 years old.
In 1996, Javed Ahmed was shot in Kashmir by the terrorists.
A part of stomach and intestine is lost .
He also suffered severe injury.
He lost his power to stand on his feet, but he did not believe that he was defeated.
How can we improve infrastructure for physically handicapped persons
How can we develop facilities for disabled in public places, government offices
They are working on these things.
Whether Javed's life is not enough to be inspiring in every corner of the country
I remember Javed Ahmed's life work, his penance and dedication on 3rd December.
I have not only mentioned Javad, but also inspired every corner of the country.
They are giving new light to live and showing new ways.
Be it the middle class, the poor, the oppressed, the oppressed, the disadvantaged, their government and the government system are constantly in touch with the middle class, and a citizen or a citizen has sometimes got a bad experience of some or the other government worker and it changes his vision of looking at the government system throughout his life.
There is also fact in this thing but lakhs of people in this government do such good things in service and dedication that never look at us.
Last year, both Bill Gates and Milinda Gates were given joint Padma Vibhushan.
They do social work in India in large numbers.
Whatever he has earned after his retirement, he is spending his life in working for the poor.
Whenever he comes to India, he appreciates the ASHA workers who have got the opportunity to work with them and tells them how dedicated and labourful this ASHA worker is.
He tells them how much enthusiasm they have to learn innovation.
A few days ago, the Odisha government had specially honoured the Independence Day of ASHA worker.
And one of the ASHA activists of this village Jamuna Manisingh decided that I will no longer die due to malaria in Tedagaon.
Going to every household and feeling a bit of fever, reach there.
There will be so many more 'Jumna Mani'.
There will be millions of people who will be around us.
We see them with a little respect.
Such people become the power of our country.
How do they become a big partner of the happiness and sorrow of the society
I salute all these ASHA workers through Jumna Mani.
My dear young friends, I am particularly active in the Internet and social media for the younger generation.
Not only this, they also show to others, they can be read and it can happen that we will have to add something to it.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
I invite you to participate in this nation.
My dear countrymen, the whole world is worried about climate change.
Climate change, global temperature rise are also discussed, care is also there and it has been accepted as a standard before doing every work.
The temperature of the earth should not increase even now .
It is the responsibility of everyone and it is also the care of everyone.
And the first way to prevent temperature rise is energy saving.
The 14th December is the National Energy Savings Day.
Several schemes are being implemented by the government.
I had once said that on the night of Purnima, the lamps of the road should be closed and darkened and kept in the light of the moon of Purnima for hours.
You should experience the light of that moon.
On seeing a woman named Noorjahan in Kanpur it seemed as if she had not got the opportunity to learn a lot .
But he is doing such a thing that perhaps no one has thought about it.
It is using solar energy to brighten the lives of the poor.
He is fighting with darkness and shouting his name.
He has prepared a committee of women and started a plant of solar powered reconnaissances and hired 100 rupees per month.
What kind of help is being provided to entrepreneurs like us
Industry, earning, empowerment.
However, the speed at which I have to go is yet to come.
But the beginning has improved.
In such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people have received Rs. 42 thousand crore under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
I am happy to note that out of 66 lakh women are scheduled, scheduled, scheduled, Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes, who are striving hard on their feet and trying to honour their families.
Abhishek has himself spoken of his enthusiasm.
There are many news coming to me too.
Someone has just told me that somebody in Mumbai is Shelesh Bhosale.
I had said during my Swachhta Abhiyan that the Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new entrepreneurs and showcase them by Shellesh Bhosle.
And I was told that in such a short span of time, they have also returned Rs. 2 lakhs to the bank.
He is working to build a ballway.
All our banks should be more sensitive and they should help the poor as much as possible.
In fact, these people run the economy of the country.
People who are small industries are the economic power of the country's economy.
We have to strengthen it.
But we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, I had discussed Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
These are such things that should continue to be aware of social life.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering in New Delhi.
How should the programme be formulated
I had said about sending such information.
I was told that a lot of information was received.
But I am expecting more information.
I hope for a very special scheme.
There can be many such things.
I am confident that your information will definitely be useful.
But I would like to urge you to exercise.
For keeping the body healthy definitely use some time of this excellent season for exercise .
If it is a rainy season then make the habit of sweet habits too.
Once again my countrymen have a lot of congratulations.
I once again meet you through Mann Ki Baat.
The 5th one-day cricket between India and South Africa is being played.
The name of this Cricket Malike is Gandhi-Mandela series.
The two teams have won each two-two combinations and therefore, the importance of final combination has increased.
My best wishes to all the sportspersons.
Today, I would like to extend my best wishes to the friend of Kannur Akashwani.
I would like to convey my best wishes that whenever I started Mann Ki Baat, many people visited Kerala, the 12th students of Kerala were also associated with this programme.
I once again want to talk about Kerala.
Students from St. Mary Opper Primary School of Kochia Chittor, Kerala have sent me a letter.
Initially, I didn't understand. I was surprised that these kids made me a map of India by the thumbs.
When I read his letters, I realized that he had given a big message.
So that organ donation becomes a tendency and tendency.
Those girls have written a letter and wrote to me that in your Mann Ki Baat programme, challenge people about organ donation.
Basantrao Sudke Guru ji, who was 80 years old in Maharashtra, has constantly started a movement.
He says organ donation should be a festival .
The attack also brings me a lot of messages from the phone.
Devesh in Delhi has given me a message.
I feel that this is very important.
More than 1. 5 lakh people in our country need kidneys, heart and liver every year.
But in our country with a population of 125 crore only five thousand transplants i . . organ transplant surgery takes place .
Every year there is a need for one lakh eyes but only 25,000 people get eyes.
When there is a need for four eyes then we can only give one eye.
Efforts have been made to guide the states.
Some states have worked well to speed up the efforts of organ donation by reducing paperwork.
Today, I can say that Tamil Nadu is at the top of the organ donation.
A very social institution, a lot of NGO has given a different direction by doing a good job.
The NOTO has been set up to give importance to organ transplant.
The joy that is being executed is the best.
Last month, we all had seen on TV that Delhi's G.
A life was saved.
Dear countrymen, now we have celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
After a few days we will celebrate Diwali.
Eid celebrated, celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi.
However, our countrymen will be proud to celebrate one more festival among these people. This will make the country proud.
The India-Africa Forens Summit will be held in New Delhi from 26-29 October 2019.
Such a big event will be held in India for the first time.
54 African countries and Union Leaders have been invited.
The population of India is the same as the population of African people.
If both the population is united then it will be one third of the worlds population.
And it is said that the territory of these two countries was united millions of years ago.
Later, it was divided into two parts due to the Indian Ocean.
And see, we are trying to meet the people and come together.
During this time, the Government of India has made a big programme by the HRD Ministry.
In order to increase the participation of all the Afilitated Schools of CBSE, an essay competition was organized in the children of schools and poem writing programmes.
About 1600 schools participated.
It included schools from outside India and India and thousands of schoolchildren had written about the desire to strengthen India-Africa relations.
On the other hand, the Mobile Exhibition from Porbandar to Memorials of Mahatma, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, is traveling from Porbandar to Northern State to Delhi on 29th October.
Millions of schoolchildren saw this exhibition and people from villages also saw this exhibition.
The people knew how great Mahatma Gandhi had played in Africa and India's relations, how much the impact of Mahatma Gandhi's personality was on these two landscapes.
Well, I can see the Indo-Africa Summit but it is an opportunity to connect people.
My best wishes to Grimala and to the children who are participating in this event, to more than 1600 schools and HRD ministers.
On August 15, I had made a proposal in the context of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Last month, a workshop was held in Bhopal where the ideal villages are going on, the heads of the village, the collectors there, some MPs there, the Government of India and the state government together discussed the Adarsh Gram Yojana.
How new things were noticed, some enthusiastic things were noticed.
He has chosen the Parsi Gram Panchayat Adarsh Gram in Kunti district of Jharkhand.
The success of making people aware of infrastructure and arrangements in the Adarsh Gram was made in this Parsi village of Jharkhand.
I congratulate Honble Parliamentarian Mr. Karia Mundanji.
So I got a news from Andhra.
The Parliamentarian of Andhra Pradesh, Ashok Gajapati Rajuji, was very much involved in the Adarsh Gram Yojana and he chose Dwarapudi Gram Panchayat as an ideal village in Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
The children taught about 550 adults and literate them.
See, there is no budget in the society, no circular, no special arrangement but the changes that are brought about due to the will power are being seen by the Gram Panchayats.
Our respected Parliamentarian Shri Yut C.
L. Ruwala, it is a Parliamentarian of Mizoram.
He has chosen Khwalahilang village as an ideal village.
This village is very famous for sugarcane production and jaggery.
How to make the village a financial centre, how to make the markets of the villages.
Ruwala ji, who has tried to make a self-reliant village with Adarsh Village, is a complimentary person.
My dear brothers and sisters, Mann Ki Baat is there and will it ever happen that there is no talk of cleanliness
My dear countrymen, I would like to recall you that the media had launched a special campaign after the festival of Diwali last year and all the things that had been cracked after Diwali were shown to the people from the channel.
Before the festival, we are concerned about the kind of accident that does not happen, but we should do it even after the festival.
And for this, I specially want to congratulate the media world of India.
On October 2, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I have been able to participate in the Swachhta Sammelan through the India Today Group for the one year of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
He was looking at the measure given by the Clean India Awards in what way efforts are being made.
How people are working like One Life, One Mission for this.
How many places are there in our country which have been kept so clean.
Since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan started, I have seen that Andhra Pradesh's e-Nadu and especially Shri Yut Ramuji Rao are very old but their enthusiasm is embarrassing any youth, not less than the youth.
He has linked 51 lakh children from about 55-56 schools to Andhra and Telangana.
Be it public places, stations, religious places or parks, a big campaign has been launched in many places.
Now this news shows the strength of fulfilling the dream of Swachh Bharat itself.
ABP News launched this Bharat Desh Hai Mera programme and made people aware about cleanliness and trained the countrymen by hiking it.
NDTV has launched a campaign called Swachh Bharat.
In Meghalaya, where our Governor Shri Yut Shanmukh Nathan, he has written a letter to me and mentioned the village Mavalyanong in Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last few years this village has taken up the fight for cleanliness.
It is said that almost every generation is dedicated to this sanitation. A few years ago, he had received the Cleanest Village Award in Asia.
This is important, we have to believe in all that our country will definitely be clean and it will happen with the efforts of the countrymen. When we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be proud to say 100 crore Indians with pride.
My dear countrymen, I had said this from the Red Fort on 15th August, there are some things where corruption has been laid and housed.
We hear all these news and that is why I was thinking about what is the need of an interview for small jobs.
I have never heard this thing in this world is such a psychological person who can fully recognize a person by taking one or two minutes
And with this idea I had announced that we will stop the slaughter of childhood for this small job.
My dear young friends, I would like to proudly say that the government has completed all these processes and the posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government will no longer be posted at the time of recruitment.
The Rule will be implemented from 1st January, 2016 and where the recruitment process is going on, we will not be able to spend but this system will be implemented from 1st January, 2016.
My best wishes to all my young friends.
I had announced an important scheme in the last budget.
Gold has become an important part of social life in our country.
Golden can become a power, gold can become an economic power.
And every Indian must contribute to it.
Under this, we can deposit your gold in the bank and the bank will give you interest as you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier we used to keep gold in locker and also have to pay the rent of locker .
Now keep it in the Gold Bank and the bank will give you interest.
Now the countrymen, cannot become gold wealth
Secondly, this bond is a paper in Sovereign Gold Band but the value of that paper is so much gold.
On the day you return this paper and on the day of return you will get the same money as the price of gold and the price of gold.
I am happy to say that we are bringing gold quins.
The Gold ueen, who brought the Ashoka Chakra, was about 70 years since independence, but till date we have been using the Foren Gold ueen.
Gold billion bonds are also used abroad.
In the coming weeks, we will also make it available to the common man before Dhanteras and we are launching gold coins of five grams and 10 grams of Ashok Chakra.
At the same time, 20 grams of gold coins will be available for the people.
I am confident that new schemes will bring about new changes in the direction of economic development.
My dear countrymen, Iron Man Vallabhbhai Patel is the birth anniversary of 31st October.
Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel recalled that the map of India comes out.
This great man has contributed a lot in Indias unity.
India is full of diversity.
Several religions, sects, dialects, varieties, varieties, varieties, varieties and diversity are our beauty.
If this was not a diversity then we could not be proud of this beauty and beauty.
Therefore, it is the mantra of unity of diversity.
Peace, harmony and unity are the real root of development.
In the last few years, on 31st October, RAN-For-Unity programmes were held in every corner of the country.
The 'Ekta ki Route' is also a battle for development in the true sense.
Pay tribute to Sardar Saheb.
Let us take forward the mantra of unity.
Brothers and sisters, Now you must have been preparing for Diwali and cleanliness will be done in the house.
You're buying new things.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in different forms in our country.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the festival of Diwali.
Due to cracking fire starts burning , due to cracks there is a lot of damage to children .
I would like to tell every parents to enjoy Diwali but do not let the accident happen, there is no harm to the child of our family and you have to think about it and clean it.
My dear countrymen, I will be visiting Britain on the second day of Diwali.
The Government of India and the State Government of India will give scholarships to those children who go abroad for studying, be it Dalits, tribals or backwards.
I am confident that when our children will be taught in Britain, the place of Baba Saheb will become an inspirational place, this message was given by Baba Saheb for a country that I am thrilled by my visit to the United Kingdom for many years.
Now you can imagine how happy the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar is being added to the wealth of 125 crore people like me.
I will get another opportunity in London and I would like to unveil the statue of Lord Vishwaswara.
Many years ago, the world needs to study the work that God Vishwaswara had done for democracy and for the Empire of Women.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Vishweshwar on the land of London is an excellent example of how the great men of India were thinking and thinking with vision many years ago.
My dear countrymen, you were associated with Mann Ki Baat.
The government officials were interacting with them.
Some people write their problems and try to solve problems.
We should learn many languages in a country like India.
I got the opportunity to learn some languages but how can I learn so many languages
But I am grateful to All India Radio that Mann Ki Baat is being broadcast in every state at 8 pm in their regional language.
Once again my beloved countrymen.
Jai Hind.
On 3rd October, I will have the privilege of speaking Mann Ki Baat.
Democracy has immense importance.
I have a fundamental idea in my life and I have a lot of faith in Jan Shakti.
However, I can tell you what I learned from Mann Ki Baat and what I had experienced.
Our ancestors used to say that Jannadan is a part of God.
With the experience of Mann Ki Baat, I can tell you that there is a great strength in the thoughts of our ancestors because I have experienced this thing.
I used to ask the people for Mann Ki Baat and I used to see only two or four information.
However, lakhs of people have been active and sent information.
This is a great strength.
When people were watching this thing, they also felt that the feeling of despair and despair of girls will have to be changed.
This was a silent revolution.
Keeping in front of the tourism point in India, I told the citizens, "Incredible India, Incredible India" and you will send a picture on the gallery of tourism to me, I will see it.
People from every part of India sent photographs in lakhs.
The tourism departments of the Government of India or the State Government have never realized that we have such a rich heritage.
All the things came on a platform and the government did not spend one rupee in it.
People have done all this.
Today, I can say with great satisfaction that the sale of khadi has doubled in the last one year.
Once I used to say in the Mann Ki Baat, we see the painting of the poor people, the children are crying and their poor mother.
Do they not want to get gas cylinders
If the government works in the hands of this society then the government can work as a motivator for social change.
Every small thing was a small issue for itself and tried to connect itself for the welfare of the country.
What can be a greater joy than this
I have decided to make a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat.
He urged the citizens of the country to bring your questions, your information and your proposals to me through telephone.
I will pay attention to Mann Ki Baat.
I am glad that more than 55,000 telephones came from all over the country, be it Sicily, Kutch, Kamrup, Kashmir or Kanyakumari.
There is no such state in India from where citizens did not call.
It is a pleasant experience.
The people of all ages shared their views and thoughts.
Some of them, I have heard myself, I am afraid that my team works on proposals on the rest of the issues.
You must have taken one-two minutes to telephonize this, but for me, the issues, ideas and issues that have been received from it are important.
The entire government will definitely work on this thing.
I have noticed what is the importance of radio for such blind people.
I see a new vision and I see many good things, good issues and the government is sufficient to be sensitive.
I would like to inform the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi that this time Mann Ki Baat has called upon the people of India to use the soil windows in Diwali as much as possible.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to stay with the soldiers of the Armed Forces for two-three hours.
Armed Forces and Air Forces protecting water, land and sky.
The war with Pakistan in 1965 completed 50 years.
We had not only heard about the pride of the war, the moments of pride, the adventure and sacrifices of our soldiers but also the techniques of photographing and filming were not available, but the moments of this exhibition must be felt by the sacrifice of the soldiers.
Whether it is the battle of Hajifeer, the actual north or the Chamida, the sight of the victory at Hajipeer Pass stands on the organ and the pride of the Indian Army is inspired.
If you want to create history then you will have to understand the smaller issues.
History keeps our bonds with our children.
If there is a break in history then the prospect of creating history gets complete rest.
A younger child has given an order to the Prime Minister, but in Ghaighai, he forgot to name himself.
We will be happy to note that on 2nd October, I have announced the campaign in the context of Swachh Bharat and I can tell you that for the first time in the Parliament, the topic of cleanliness is being discussed.
There was also criticism on our government.
I also have to hear a lot of things that Modiji used to talk about cleanliness but what happened
I do not feel bad to hear this, but it shows me a good thing that there is a discussion about India's cleanliness in the Parliament of the country.
And on the other hand, on the one hand, when these young children of the Parliament and the country speak about cleanliness, there can be no such thing for the country.
This movement is going on, it is seen that awareness about ideas, cleanliness and cleanliness is being created.
This will also lead to the working of the government, work and action will be inevitable.
In the year 2019, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in India, we have worked towards realizing the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
We are sure, what does Mahatma Gandhi say
At one place, he says that if there is a time to choose one of the two freedom and cleanliness then I will give priority to cleanliness, cleanliness for Gandhijis after independence was more important than independence.
Gulshan Arora from Delhi commenced Mygov.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly inspired by the lives of great men.
The evaluation of this great man was not our work.
All those who live for the country and those who die for the country are inspiring us.
These days will give us the opportunity to remember all these great men.
On 25th September, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur Shastri on 2nd October, Jaiprakash Narayan Ji on 11th October, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
You will take any date and you will find the name of some great person associated with that date in the eyes of history.
I once again request you, especially for 2nd October.
On October 2, the birth anniversary of the revered Bapu is Mahatma Gandhi.
The work that the government cannot do by making a big deal of expenditure has been done due to your small action and help.
This is the manpower and therefore I once again urge you to do this thing.
Friends, My heart is happy with one thing.
Chandra Bose had arranged all the arrangements with the daughter of Subhash Babu.
Chanda Bose and his family took this work on their minds and in the last week, there was a strong report that more than 50 of Subhash Babu's family members will be coming to the Prime Minister's residence.
You can imagine how happy it will be for me.
They will get the opportunity to visit the Prime Minister's residence, at the first time, with Netaji's bonds.
But I am glad more than that because there has never been such a visit at the Prime Minister's residence before, which I will have the privilege of doing in October.
More than 50 relatives of Subhash Babu, family members, people from different countries, all the issues will be requested.
How happy is the moment for me.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to awaken you to the younger generation about the electoral registration, which will increase the participation of the youth in the coming days and will help the younger generation to choose and run the government in the future.
I hope that those youngsters who have not yet registered their names will be registered and they will definitely vote.
The seventh student of Kshitij Pandey met me in the Anaras Hindu University and the seventh in the Central School.
There is self-confidence with him.
At this young age, I had seen the interest of physics and it would have been reading a lot.
The daughter of Sadavat Patel, who lives in Sunderpur in Varanasi.
On the other hand, his father said, "No, if the three mathematics takes the book in hand, then in the evening, the whole face opens the history and the whole face in the evening.
We are surprised to all the families that I am very impressed.
Sometimes such children are happy, but I don't know anything about Sonam.
I feel that Deva has given a power.
In my visit to Kashi, I got the opportunity to meet two children.
Similarly, my visit to these two children will be remembered.
Through Mann Ki Baat, many people are suggesting new things for me.
To see this thing, what does Sandeep say of Haryana, Sandeep Haryana, Sir Mann Ki Baat once a month, you should do it every week because you get inspiration by listening to your speeches.
Sandeep ji, what did you do from me
Once a month, I have to do a lot of work even when I have to do it, I have to plan on time.
Currently, there is a place in the month.
Mann Ki Baat completed one year in a way.
You know how much to use Subhashbabu radio
From Germany, he started his radio centre and used to inform the citizens of India about the freedom movement from this radio centre.
He started a weekly report of Azad Hind Radio.
He used to broadcast radio from English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathis, Punjabi, Parsi Urdu all languages.
It has been a year since I have been talking about Mann Ki Baat from Akashwani.
Keep sending your information, ideas, proposals.
It also benefits the government.
The reforms are initiated.
Your contribution, your participation is valuable and invaluable for me.
Once again my best wishes to you all.
Citizens of South India are celebrated on the occasion of Onam and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Rakshabandhan.
Considering the issue of social security, the Government of India has started several new schemes for the common man.
I am happy that everyone has accepted this scheme in a short span of time.
I had requested our sisters to visit these security schemes on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
I have been told that 11 crore families have been connected to them since the launch of this scheme and I have been told that almost the benefits of these schemes have been given to mothers and sisters.
I convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious occasion of Rakshabandhan.
Today, while talking to you, it has been a year for you to take up the Jan Dhan Yojana in a big way.
Bank Mitra Yojana has also been strengthened to ensure that the banking sector is also an important part of the economy.
Today, more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
You will be happy to note that in this year, one lakh 31 thousand economic literacy camps will be organized to connect the banking sector, the economy and the poor.
Not just opening accounts.
Now thousands of citizens are eligible for overdraft facilities under this Jan Dhan Yojana.
It is a belief that the poor can get money from the bank.
I once again congratulate all of you and urge the poor brothers and sisters of the poorest of the poor who have opened their accounts in the bank to keep them intact.
This bank is yours, don't leave it now.
I have brought the bank to you and now it is your work to keep it hold.
Due to the recent incidents in Gujarat, the whole country was restless due to violence and it is adventurous that if something happened in the land of Gandhiji and Sardar, then the whole country was at the forefront.
But in a very short span of time all my sons and sisters of Gujarat have brought the situation under control.
He played an active role to ensure that the situation does not get worse and once again Gujarat started on the path of peace.
Peace, unity and brotherhood have to walk on the right path and the path of development and shoulder to shoulder.
Development is the answer to our problems.
I had the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi community recently.
I got the opportunity to hear their thoughts and tell you the truth that I felt like listening to music from their speeches.
I have come here to speak to these scholars to select their words, the way to speak, the generosity and harmony in the Sufi tradition, which has a rhythm of music.
I feel very nice.
Probably there is a real need to reach Islam's true form to the world.
The Sufi sect that has been linked to love and generosity will reach far and wide the message that will benefit humanity, Islam will also benefit and I also tell others that we should understand the Sufi sect and Sufi tradition of any community.
I am fortunate that I will get another opportunity in the coming days and I will get this invitation.
The scholars of Buddhist tradition from many countries around the world will be visiting India, Bodhgaya and discussing the well-being of humanity, welfare and global issues.
I am glad that I have received an invitation to visit Bodhgaya.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Bodhgaya.
It is a pleasant moment for me to have the opportunity to visit Bodhgaya with such scholars from all over the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, Today I once again want to tell you the issues of my mind.
I had already given this topic from Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard, in my speech in Parliament, in public meetings and in Mann Ki Baat.
Every time I have been telling you that the government of India is open in the matter of the land acquisition law that is going on.
This means that the situation before the formation of my government has been re-established.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to assure that Jai Jawan Jai Kisan is not just an announcement for us.
This mantra is the welfare of the villages, the poor and the farmers.
Therefore, on 15th August we used to say that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be set up.
We are implementing this decision immediately.
The war of 1965 was completed 50 years two days ago and when the issue of the war of 1965 came out, the adventurous Lal Bahadur Shastri ji remembered.
I salute all those who have won India in the 65th war and salute the heroes.
Such incidents of history will always inspire us.
Just as I got the opportunity to meet the people of Sufi community last week, I got a pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to interact with the renowned scientists across the country for hours.
I am glad to learn that India is doing well in the field of science and in many directions.
Our scientists are performing well.
I got a lot of new information.
I can say that it will not only be inspiring for me but it will also be easier to learn new things.
And I saw that many young scientists were speaking enthusiastically and many dreams were seen in their eyes.
From Mann Ki Baat last time I used to say that students should move towards the field of science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are many opportunities and there are many possibilities.
I would like to reiterate that my young friends should look at science and inspire our educational institutions for this.
We have written about skill development.
Shri Prakash of Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu has stressed on the needs of good teachers for primary education.
The focus has been on reforms in the education sector.
Especially to my young friends, I would like to tell you one thing.
In a speech from the Red Fort on 15th August, I had said that this child is a child for job at the lower level.
And when there are letters for childbirth, every poor family, widow mother gets anxious that who will be recommended or who will get this job
I don't know what words are used
Everyone was running away and perhaps corruption at the lower level was also one of the reasons.
I am happy to say in my address on 15th August that the government has taken steps at a rapid pace in this regard that it has been only 15 days in such a short span of time.
Information is being sent and the decision is now almost going to be implemented to ensure that there is no shortage of childhood for small posts.
It is unfortunate that in our country every year about 50 thousand mothers and 13 lakh children die immediately after delivery and delivery.
This is worrisome and terrible.
If we look at this, there has been a lot of improvement in this regard.
But now we have to save our mothers and newborns.
We look at the news on television but we don't pay attention but we don't see the news from the newspapers.
Along with clean water, it is necessary to keep small things clean at home.
Life is valuable.
It is not right to ignore dirty water and despair of sanitation are the causes of death.
Dengue testing is done free of cost at around 514 centres across the country.
Rakshabandhan to Diwali is the time of several festivals in our country.
Let us integrate every festival with cleanliness. See, this quality of cleanliness will come in your own nature.
We cannot get the privilege of offering our lives to the nation but I always say that it is the privilege of living for the country.
Two youngsters of our country, two brothers, Dr.
Hitendra Mahajan and Dr.
How everybody is trying to take the country forward and this is the only thing that can be heard and filled with pride.
Sometimes we do injustice to our youth due to lack of understanding.
But my experience in the youth is different.
Sometimes we know new things and learn new things by talking to them.
Several youngsters who have said that I have taken the message of Sande on Cycle.
One day in a week, Cycle-Day is certain.
He said that the joy of being good for health, environment and youth is all possible.
In our country, the attacks in many households increase the number of bicycle users.
I am happy to note that these are the best efforts to save the environment and to maintain health and today, two youths of my country have been thinking about Indias flag hoisting in the United States.
Today, I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra.
This memorial will inspire us to work on the taxation of Dalits, exploited, oppressed and deprived.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for these two initiatives that are proud of Ambedkar.
The country can be moved forward by putting the shoulders on the shoulders.
My best wishes to you all and my best wishes.
It will definitely help our farmer brothers and sisters for the sake of Kharipa.
I remembered one more thing to feel joy and I was happy.
The cereals and oilseeds have always been fragmented in our country.
The poor people get rice, food and vegetables.
I am happy that the cereals that have been produced this year have increased by 50 and oilseeds production by about 33.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, 26th July has been recorded in the history of our country as Vijay Diwas.
The farmers who have a relationship with the land of this country are also the soldiers.
During the Kargil war, our soldiers broke down on hundreds of enemies.
The war of Kargil was not just a war on the border but every city of India, every village of India was involved in it.
This fight was fought for those mothers and sisters who were fighting the enemy in Kargil.
The youngsters who had not left the henna in their hands for marriage fought this war, seeing their brave young kids, the fathers who felt like being young again, had fought this war by holding the fingers of their fathers who had never learned to walk.
Today, due to the sacrifice of all these people, India can talk to the world.
In 2014, after our government came to power, we started the MyGov Mission on 26th July.
We have launched this website to connect every citizen to development work and to increase their participation in democracy.
And after a year, I am happy to say that about two crore citizens visited MyGovy website.
Nearly five and a half lakh citizens have registered a response and especially more than 50,000 citizens have received information on PMO APLICATIONS.
Is it appropriate that such people have difficulty to take the ticket of the train
However, it looks very small at the top but the government did not remember it.
However, the government had seriously considered the issue of Akhilesh and today a separate arrangement has been implemented for the reservation of tickets for our disabled daughters and sisters.
The attack creates new logoes, to lines, programme policies and information comes on MyGov.
It is felt that new winds are flowing in the governance system.
One feels a new consciousness.
MyGov has started coming to my address on 15th August.
From Chennai, Sumitra Raghavchary has suggested a lot.
I believe that it is a good idea to suggest issues to the citizens of the country for what should be in my address on August 15.
I am confident that you will definitely make good information.
I take care of one thing and it reaches you.
I don't want to preach anybody, I don't want to reverse the responsibilities of the central government, the state government or the local self-state organisation.
Just two days ago, I saw the scene of an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver was desperate in the wounded condition for about ten minutes.
Hoshakote Akshay of Bangalore, Amay Joshi of Pune and Prasandha Kakunje of Murbidri in Karnataka have expressed concern over this issue.
One person dies every four minutes in road accident.
But I urge the parents, whether they are running a two-wheeler or the four-wheeler, the education of all these things will be available from the households, the parents should pay attention to them.
In this regard, the government has formulated a lot of new policies and has taken initiatives, be it training to the citizens about road safety, road planning systems or accidents.
Keeping in mind all these things, we will pass the Transport and Security Bill.
We are thinking of taking several important steps in the coming days to implement the National Road Safety Policy and the Road Safety Action Plan.
This scheme is a cashless treatment for the highways of Gurgaon, Jaipur, Baroda and Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondia.
This means that we are prioritizing those who are injured in the accident to get immediate medical assistance in 50 hours after the accident, whether they are near to pay attention or not.
Total free phone number 1033 will be available all around the country for providing information about the accident.
There is a need to pay more attention to the fact that there is no accident in the root because one life and life of everyone is more important.
Sometimes I say that the worker should be a worker.
In the last few days, I felt that I should talk to you about some things.
But how to bring Chaitanya to the task taken
Vijay Biswal has shown how his talent and art capabilities are associated with his work.
There is a possibility that they will be spoken about their pictures and I got information about another thing.
The entire group of government officials in the Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, a different task and a different campaign started by the team touched me.
I liked his work and I would like to hear the mission of Operation Malayalam that these officers started.
However, he gave a new turn to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Near Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh is a field named Keshla .
The people of this village have made toilets with their efforts.
Now no person in this village goes to the open for toilets and when the toilets were completed then Keshla village celebrated the festival.
This is an excellent example of how the values of social life change, how the mindset of the people change and how the citizens of the country are moving forward.
Bhavesh Deka from Guwahati has written about questions related to the Northeast.
However, the people of the Northeastern region are active.
They will go to the village, speak to the officials of the administration there and talk to the people and the citizens.
The central government will do whatever it is possible to solve these problems.
A good effort is an attempt to move east of Delhi and the East Policy which I say is not the same.
My dear countrymen, the success of the Mangal Mission is a matter of pride and happiness for all of you.
We know this news but we don't care about it.
I always tell these officers that the IAS officers of the government should go to a school and college near about two-four hours a week and interact with the students there.
This work is difficult, but it has to be done.
There is no electricity during the examination, so don't break into the study of children.
If you want to start a small business in the village then there will be electricity.
At some places, one has to go to another village to charge the mobile.
We must do this, we have started it.
Today, I felt that Mann Ki Baat should talk to you on different topics.
My best wishes to you all.
You must send your information and new ideas for 15th August, I will definitely be useful.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
Something is less, I feel sarkhas.
We were listening to a lot of things in the form of a person in the family of 130 crore Indians sitting in our humans and in a luxurious atmosphere.
Sometimes you people used to inspire yourselves.
You will imagine how this period of holidays has been done.
On Sunday, the last Sunday in the month, at 11 o'clock in the morning, your visit has been completed.
Every moment I feel like doing something like Miss.
And whenever I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I used to speak alone and the words may be mine, the voice may be mine, but the story is yours, the male and the valour is yours.
I used to use only my words and my speeches.
There was a feeling of immense vacancy in the mind.
Once you come to mind and now elections are over, you should immediately come and talk about four things.
But afterwards I thought, no
We have a Sunday programme and it should continue.
But these Sundays were just waiting for a lot.
Small, simple, simple and light things are also responsible for bringing about changes in the lives of society.
This is a part of it in a way and this order gives birth to a new energy, a pure consciousness and in a sense, it has to move forward with the consciousness of a New India.
Several messages have been received in the last few months and innumerable people have been missing Mann Ki Baat.
Whenever I read this message, I feel sorry.
This is my journey from Aham to Yam.
This silence dialogue with you for me was also a part of my spiritual journey.
Several people have asked a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath in the polls.
You have the right to ask such questions.
And I can understand that you will also have the curiosity of knowing the answers to these questions.
Only one can say that the slightest vacancies given to Mann Ki Baat were created in my mind and I am sure to have got the opportunity to fill the pocket in the valleys of Kedar.
As many people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar's visit, your efforts to boost a positive thing, I feel sustained from your speeches.
The letters that come to Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are available are different from the routine, that is, the daily government work.
Sometimes the letters you have sent were also a cause for inspiration for me.
Sometimes, some words of you do the work of shaping my thought process.
I understand the challenges faced by the people of the country and the society.
At the same time, people also tell them what is the answer to these problems.
In the letters, people face their problems and also write what is the answer to it.
Its answers to the links of questions, some or the other new ideas, direct or indirectly.
Mann Ki Baat is like a mirror for the country and the society.
Today, my heart is very happy.
In the past, I had finally said that now we have met in three-four months and some people had taken out the political meaning.
This self-confidence was not of some Modi.
So this belief was the foundation of your faith.
All of you are taking the form of faith.
And that is why I had said in Akher's Mann Ki Baat very easily that after a few months I will come to speak to you.
You only used to sit here and you have given me the opportunity to speak again.
If we come with this feeling then we will continue the sequence of Mann Ki Baat in the first place.
The movement was not limited to the prison.
There was anger in the minds and minds of the people.
Democracy was a triumph in the mind.
Whenever you get food from time to time, you do not understand what is hungry.
Just like that, they understand the importance of democratic rights.
In the times of emergency, every citizen of the country was feeling like surviving himself.
Even if anybody smiles that we have never used, the same thing happens to him.
Some arrangements have been made in the Constitution of India and democracy has been adopted here.
There is also a need to reduce the social system.
There is also a need for laws and regulations and rights and duties.
However, the pride and pride of India can say that for us there is a culture of democracy that is greater than laws and rules.
Democracy is our culture.
Democracy is our heritage and our tradition.
And with this heritage we have become small and big.
That is why the country had called for a full election not for us but for the protection of democracy.
We have simplified the valuable democracy that you have got.
In India, more than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
But if the world wants to share its share then I say that if one leaves China then more than the population of any other country, people have the right to vote in India.
The number of voters voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the United States, almost double.
More than the population of the entire Europe, there are total voters in India.
We can imagine how big the resources and human resource are required to fulfil this election.
Millions of teachers, officers and employees have worked day and night to overcome the elections.
Nearly three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces performed their responsibility for the success of this great democracy.
At the same time, 20 lakh police personnel from different states also served hard work.
You can imagine how much the total election was.
All this was done to ensure that a single voter should not be deprived of his voter, all the eligible voters should have the right to vote.
In the inaccessible areas like Arunachal Pradesh, the polling stations were set up for a single female voter.
You will be surprised to know that the officers of the Election Commission had to travel for two-two days to reach those remote places.
Besides, one thing has been made to express pride in this election.
I convey my best wishes to the Election Commission and to every person involved in this election process and bow down to the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, all of you must have heard from me often that I urge you not to book.
We can all give books instead of flowers while welcoming them.
After listening to this, people have begun to welcome books in many places.
I have recently visited a book titled 'Premchand Ki Popular Kahaniyan'.
I liked this visit.
However, I could not get a lot of time but during the journey I got the opportunity to read some of his stories once again.
Premchand has portrayed the realities of the society in his stories and when he reads it, the paintings of that time have to be made in front of his eyes.
Every description he wrote, every thing goes alive.
In his stories, the whole of India feels inclusive.
While reading the story of Nasha written by him, my mind was following the question of economic inequality in the society itself.
I remembered the period of my youth.
Our youth had debates overnight on the economic inequality of the society.
In this story, the sensitivity of a child, the immense mother in her mind, the maturity of thoughts in such a young age.
The 4-5-year-old Hamid, whenever he comes from the fair to his place, in the real sense, human sentiments reach the highest peak, will finally make the reader very emotional.
In this story, one of the most live paintings of the lives of a poor farmer can be read.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village in the very dense forest of Idukki.
Primary teacher P.
Murlidharan and a small tea shop runr P.
V.
Both Chinnathampi started this library with tireless hard work.
Sometimes both of them used to make books and they used to take books in their villages in the jungle with their weight.
Today this library is working to show a new direction to everyone along with the tribal children here.
In Gujarat, their Gujarat campaign has been successful.
Millions of people from all age groups participated in this campaign and read books.
In today's digital era, I urge you people to keep books for some time in your daily work.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to note that the people of our country not only think of the present times but also think of the future challenges.
When I was reading your responses to the Narendra Modi App and MyGov, I remember that many people have written a lot about the water problem.
Besides Pawan Gaurai of Belgaum, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Vijay Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related challenges.
Water should be equal to mother and should be blessed with mother and the grace of the mother in the form of water should be upon us.
Due to the deficiency of water in many parts of the country dryness occurs every year .
We save only eight percent of water and therefore we need to solve this problem.
Just as we all have discovered answers from the peoples participation and from the peoples power, just as one hundred and thirty-three crore countrymen will find solutions to the water problem with the help of all, with the help of all and determination.
Keeping in mind the importance of water is the highest, the Ministry of Jal Shakti is now being formed in the country.
This will facilitate speedy decisions on all issues related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to do something very fast.
I wrote letters to the Sarpanches from all over the country and to the Prime Ministers of the village.
In order to save water, to keep water storage, no drops of rain should be left. To save rain water, the heads of the village should speak to the village meetings and meetings.
We have resolved to save every drop of water in villages and villages and save rain water.
In today's Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to listen to you about a Sarpanch.
The people there have once again proved to play an active role in water conservation.
I convey my best wishes to all the villages Prime Ministers, all the Sarpanches for the activity that they have shown to save water.
Several structures across the country have made a similar resolution for water conservation.
In a way, the entire village has got the opportunity to work.
The people of the villages are now in the competition to build water temples in their villages.
I have already said that if a collective endeavour is done then there will be very good positive results.
There cannot be a single specific Famrula to overcome water storage throughout the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country.
But all the goals are the same and that is, water saving, water conservation.
The work is being done to improve the drainage lines in Punjab.
These works will solve the problem of water consumption.
The Thimaipalli in Telangana is being constructed here and the lives of the people of the village are changing.
The small ponds built in the fields of Kabirdham in Rajasthan have made major changes.
I was reading about the collective efforts made in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I also read that the women in Garhwal are doing the work of Renwater Harvesting together in a very good way.
I believe that whenever we all strive together and strive hard, it would be impossible.
Water will be saved at the same time when everybody is involved in the work of water conservation.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I appeal to the countrymen about three things.
My first appeal is that just as the countrymen have made the Swachhta Abhiyan a movement, just as the people of the country have started a mass movement for water conservation.
Let us all resolve to save every drop of water together and I believe that water is a prasad given by God.
Earlier, we used to say that the touch of Paris was made of iron gold.
I say that water is perishable and a new life is created by water touch.
A awareness campaign should be started to save every drop of water .
Make the society aware and connect the society.
I urge all of us to share the traditional methods of water conservation.
If one of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar at the birthplace of revered Bapu, then he would have seen this place and there is another house behind the house of revered Bapu.
Therefore, I always tell you that if someone goes to Kirti temple then you should definitely see the storage of water.
Let us make a list of more and more methods related to water conservation and encourage people to conserve water.
We can share your information with the use of Janshakti for Jalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude for another thing.
He gave me information through Twitter about how the Presidents of many countries, Prime Ministers, dignitaries, ordinary citizens celebrated Yoga Day in their country.
On that day the whole world was looking at a happy, happy family.
Therefore, the propaganda of Yoga is a great task of social service.
Wouldn't those who serve this kind of service be acknowledged and respected
In the year 2019, the Prime Minister Award was announced to promote Yoga and contribute excellently to development.
This is inspiring.
Now the topic of Yoga is going on, but Indians are not lagging behind in this field.
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger has also been honored and these institutions have been dedicated to Yoga for the last few decades.
My dear countrymen, this journey is starting today, new feelings, new resolutions, new strengths, but I will continue to wait for your consultations.
Come on, we will continue to meet and keep talking.
I hear your feelings and keep in mind.
Sometimes they try to live the feelings.
Your blessings would continue to be found in this way.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Once again, we will meet at Mann Ki Baat next month.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
In the terror attack in Pulwama, there has been an intense feeling of consciousness in the minds of the people of the country after the martyrdom of the brave soldiers.
Condolences to the brave soldiers and their families.
The feelings of intense conscience against such terrorist violence are in the minds of all of you and my hearts. The same feelings are in the minds of the humanitarian community all over the world to believe in the minds and humanity of every countrymen.
I salute all the brave sons of the country who sacrificed their lives for the protection of Mother India.
Our armed forces have always shown unique adventure and valour.
Where they have shown unprecedented potential to establish peace.
At the same time, he has worked to respond to the attackers in their own language.
You must have seen how action has been taken within a hundred hours.
Ramniranjan Ji, the father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, in such a sad occasion, is inspiring to all of you.
We will send our second son to the army to fight the enemy and we will fight ourselves if needed.
The entire country salutes the brave courage of the martyrdom of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha, the wife of Meenaji.
He has also decided to recruit one of his only children in the CRPF.
When Gumla village in Jharkhand reached the body of martyr Vijay Shoren, who was wrapped in the Tricolor, his sinful son said that we will also be admitted to the Army.
The courage shown by these innocent children is the feeling of every young child in India today.
This feeling is visible from the houses and houses of our brave and brave martyrs.
There is no exception to our brave martyrs that their family is not exception.
Whether it is the family of the martyrdom of Deoria Vijay Maurya or the parents of the martyrdom of Kangra, or the six-year-old son of the martyrdom of Kota, the story of every family of the martyrdom of the soldiers is inspiring.
We do not need to look at the old events of history to know what is the penance of sacrifice.
These are the illustrious examples before our eyes.
These examples are the source of inspiration for Indias bright future.
My dear countrymen, we have been waiting for the National Military Memorial for the last several years and now this waiting will end soon.
Therefore, it is natural to have curiosity and curiosity in the minds of the countrymen.
On the Narendra Modi App, Udupi resident of Karnataka, Mr. Omkar Shetty has expressed happiness that the work of the National War Memorial was completed and completed.
It is a memorial that will preserve the story of the great bravery of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to make it by thinking that there should be an inspirational memorial in the country.
We decided to build a National Military Memorial and work was also started.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, this National Military Memorial will be delivered to our Armed Forces.
This country will make a very little effort to repay the loans on you.
This new memorial has been built near the India Gate and the Amar Jawan Jyoti portion of the heart place of Delhi.
I am confident that visiting this National Military Memorial is a pious task of the countrymen to visit a pilgrimage.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the country for the supreme sacrifice of the soldiers after independence.
The construction of this memorial will showcase the indomitable adventure of our Amar Sainiks.
The theme of this National Military Memorial is based on four centres, from the birth of a soldier to the martyrdom.
The immortality of the martyrs of Amar Chakra is the symbol of the martyrs.
The security cycle after this is reflecting the security.
In this cycle there are lines of dense trees .
These trees are the symbols of the soldiers and are giving a message to the citizens of the country, every moment the soldiers are stationed on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Whoever comes here with the aim of knowing the valour of these brave soldiers will be able to know about the soldiers who have dedicated their lives to the nation so that they can keep the country safe.
Our Armed Forces, Police and Armed Forces in the development of the country are indeed unable to express their great and invaluable contributions.
I want all of you to express gratitude to the men and women police personnel who are constantly working for our security.
I hope that you all will definitely visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
This will inspire others to visit this holy place and they will also be eager to visit this holy place.
On this occasion, when I was reading the response from you, I would like to take care of Atish Mukhopadhyay ji's very delightful response.
He wrote that on March 3, 1900, the British had attacked Birsa Munda.
And Yoga is also the birth anniversary of Jamshedji Tata on 3rd March.
Both have come from a very different family background but both of them have enriched the tradition, heritage and history of Jharkhand.
In Mann Ki Baat, Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata were paid homage in a way to salute the glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great dignitaries have not only named Jharkhand but also the name of the entire country.
The whole country is grateful for his contribution.
Today, if our youngsters can be named as a guide inspiring personality, then they are Lord Birsa Munda.
When the British slept Birsa Munda, they were hiding and hiding.
Do you know why the British had to accept such a reversal to catch Munda
Because they were afraid of the British Munda, who created such a big empire.
Lord Birsa Munda had only solved the British government with the help of our traditional blessings and guns.
In fact, if people get such an inspiring leadership then the collective will become stronger than the strength of the armed forces in front of the enemy.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals.
He has done everything in his Alpines.
In the dark life of the deprived and exploited, he brought light like the sun rays.
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed his life in the age of 25 years.
Like Birsa Munda, the son of Mother India has been in every part of the country.
But it is unfortunate that the stories of sacrifice, valour and sacrifice of these great people have not reached the new generation.
If a personality like Lord Birsa Munda has made us realize the existence, then a personality like Jamshedji Tata has created big institutions in the country.
Jamshedji Tata was keen to be the centre of science, technology and industry for a bright future.
He also established several world-class institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
Jamshed ji Tata and Swami Vivekanand ji had once met in the ship during their visit to the United States.
The foundation stone of the Indian Institute of Science was laid by this discussion.
My dear countrymen, the former Prime Minister of our country Morarjibhai Desai was born on 29th February.
You all know that this date comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai, a simple and peaceful personality, was one of the most eminent leaders of the country.
Morarjibhai Desai is also the record of presenting the budget for the first time in Parliament in independent India.
Morarji Desai led India in the difficult times when the country was in a democratic crisis.
Morarjibhai Desai was bowing himself to the movement against the Emergency for the protection of democracy.
He had to count a huge price in his old age.
The government of that time used to attack them and put them in the clutches.
He became the Prime Minister of the country when he won elections in 1977.
Accordingly, the fundamental rights obtained under Sections 20 and 21 of the Constitution will not be violated even during the emergency.
Morarji Bhai had revised this incident to ensure that there was no repetition in the future in the manner in which democracy was assassinated in the Emergency Law, 1975.
Today, once again I pay homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, people were very excited about the Padma Awards every year.
In such a situation, we feel that those people who work with selflessness and their work should be respected.
Several people are making positive changes in the lives of people in different ways with their hard work.
Those people who are working with selflessness in the service of public service, social service and the greatest national service.
They are a real worker and are far away from the world of fame and they do not have the pride of being named or not.
He believes in work, the message of "Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam" is a direct world in a way.
Today I would like to talk to you about some such people.
Khatri is working to bring these rare paintings to the new generation.
The Trif of Life built by Abdul Gafur was a visit to former US President Barack Obama.
Among the standards of Padma Awards, Shabbir Syed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Mother Goddess.
The way they have dedicated their entire life to the service of Goddess, they seem to be different from their work.
Even after the age of centuries, many people of the world are training Yoga.
So far, he has made one and a half thousand people 'Yog teachers' and Jamuna Tudu, who is known as Lady Tarjan in Jharkhand, has done a lot of courage to do with timber mafia and naxalvads and save 50 hectares of jungles from erosion.
Due to the hard work of Junabai ji, the villagers of that area plant 18 trees after the birth of every child in their homes.
He has worked towards women empowerment and how farming can be benefitted.
Kisan Chachi has inspired 300 women from their region to become financially self-reliant by connecting them with Self Help Groups.
This change in the list of award winners is a new image of a transforming India.
My dear countrymen, today I will tell you here that I have just come here to see a heart-breaking experience.
Today, wherever I go in the country, I am trying to meet the beneficiaries of the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, PMJAY or Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme.
I have noticed that this scheme is bringing about a big change in the lives of the poor.
If a poor person is not able to undertake any cost-effective medication, then we must inform him about this scheme.
This scheme is for such poor people.
My dear countrymen, the season of examinations will start in schools.
The tenth and twelfth examinations will be started in the next few weeks involving different examination boards across the country.
My heartiest congratulations to the parents of all the students and all the teachers who gave the exam.
A few days ago, a very big programme like 'Pariksha Pe Church' was organized in Delhi, like the Town Hall programme.
On the occasion, he spoke very fondly on the subjects related to the Pariksha Pe Discussion programme, especially on the subjects related to the examination.
This will facilitate the benefits of students.
All the students, their teachers and parents can see the entire recording of this programme on YouTube and congratulations to all my exam warriors for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, there is a discussion about India and there is no talk of festivals.
This is the reason why thousands of years old culture and traditions that have benefited us.
My dear countrymen, I had visited Kashi a few days ago and I got the opportunity to spend some time with Divyang brothers and sisters in this visit to Kashi.
And it is a pleasant surprise to hear the copy of it for me.
The way I speak in Mann Ki Baat, the youngsters with disabilities have been duplicated in the same way.
I am very happy that people not only listen to Mann Ki Baat but also leave it.
I was indeed very impressed by the power of that Divyang youth.
My dear countrymen, connecting with all of you through Mann Ki Baat is an urgent experience for me.
In a way, I interact with crores of families every month through radio.
Many times while talking to all of you, reading your letters or listening to your thoughts on a telephone, I feel that all of you have considered me a member of your family.
This is a pleasant experience for me.
Friends, Elections is the biggest festival of democracy.
In the coming two months, all of you will be busy in the elections.
I myself will be a candidate in this election.
After respecting a strong democratic tradition, Mann Ki Baat will be held on the last Sunday of May.
This means the month of March, the month of April and the entire month of May.
After the election on all your emotions of this period, with a new faith and with the strength of your blessings, I will start a programme to interact with you once again through Mann Ki Baat and will continue to make Mann Ki Baat with you for several years.
Once again I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
Shivkumar Swamiji dedicated his entire life to social service.
Bhagwan Basaveshwar has taught us that Kayakve Kailas should continue to follow his responsibilities by working hard, that is, the residence of Lord Shivaji is like living in Kailashdham.
He was a scholar who had wonderful influence on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He used to drive the entire life to provide food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
I have had the privilege of getting the blessings of Lord Swamiji several times.
In 2007, the President of India, Dr.
Kalam Saheb had heard a poem for worshipping Swamiji.
In Giving, You receive Happiness Alliance Will Blace, All Your Action Dr. Kalam Saheb, this poem presents the life and mission of Shri Shivkumar Swami Ji and Siddhganga Monastery in a beautiful way.
Once again, I pay homage to such a great man.
There is a very important institution in our country, which is an integral part of our democracy and is older than our democracy - I am talking about the Election Commission of India.
The people of the world are surprised to see the establishment day of the Election Commission, which was celebrated as the National Voters Day, the massive elections held in India, and the skills that our Election Commission manages, it is natural to feel proud of the Election Commission.
In our country, every citizen of India, who is a registered voter.
Nobody leaves any stone unturned to ensure that the registered voter will get an opportunity to vote.
We hear that even 15,000 feet above the sea level in Himachal Pradesh, the polling stations are started, while the most remote islands like Andaman and Nicobar Islands are also arranged.
Imagine, just for a voter.
When you hear this thing, it is natural to feel proud of the Election Commission.
This is the beauty of our democratic beauty that the Election Commission employees should go to distant areas and make arrangements for voting so that they can get the opportunity to utilize their voters.
I appreciate the Election Commission, which has constantly strived to strengthen our democracy.
I would like to appeal to the younger generation that if they are eligible to vote, they must register as a voter.
At the same time, it is my duty to vote.
We must realize this responsibility.
This should be our tendency, our tendency.
This should be our version.
I urge the nominees of the country to create awareness amongst the people by conducting a campaign to register a voter or vote for the people.
I hope that a large number of young voters will be registered and your participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great land of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some unique and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is a multilateral spring.
One of these great men was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On January 23, the whole country celebrated their birth anniversary in a different way.
I was fortunate to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to the freedom struggle of India on the occasion of Netajis birth anniversary.
You know that many rooms and buildings were closed in the Red Fort since independence.
Conversion of closed rooms in the Red Fort is now a very beautiful museum, dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and Indian National Army
Yad-e-Jallian and 1857 ATEN FIFTI consumption, dedicated to India's First War of India, and the entire campus is dedicated to the nation as the Kranti Mandir.
Every brass of this museum has a smell of our glorious history.
The Thai Thai in the Museum inspires us to see the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle in history.
At the same place, the British Rajvati had run the slaughter on the brave son of Mother India-Karnal Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurubaksingh Dhillan and Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
When I used to see the memorials associated with Netaji in the Red Fort, Kranti Mandir, then the members of Netaji's family presented me a very special cap.
Netaji used to wear the cap.
I gave the cap to be kept in the museum so that the people coming there should see the cap and take the inspiration of patriotism from it.
In fact, the bravery and patriotism of our heroines need to reach different forms to the new generation.
A month ago, I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December.
The tricolor was hoisted at the same place where the tricolor was hoisted by Netaji Subhas Bose 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted in the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because there was a tradition of 15th August.
On this occasion, the establishment of Azad Hind Government had completed 75 years.
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and a skilled association.
A brave soldier who played a key role in the freedom struggle.
Let's go to Delhi, let me die, let me give you a bright announcement, and Netaji got a place in the minds of every Indian.
For many years, there was a demand for bringing the files related to Netaji to everyone and I am happy that we could do this.
I remember that day when all the families of Netaji had come to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together, we all saluted a lot of things related to Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhas Bose.
I am glad that several places related to the heroes of India have been made to develop in Delhi.
Whether it is 26 related to Babasaheb Ambedkar, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir.
If you come to Delhi then you must see these places.
My dear countrymen, today when we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and this Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
I have always considered radio connectivity to the people as an important medium, as well as Netaji was also very close to the radio and he was also selecting the media to interact with the countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu launched Azad Hind Radio and interacted with the soldiers and people of Azad Hind Army through radio.
There was a different style of launching the address on the radio of Subhash Babu.
At the outset of his address, he used to say that as soon as he was listening to Your Over the Azad Hind Radio, a new zeal and a new energy was being transmitted to the audience.
I have been told that these radio stations used to broadcast weekly news in many languages like English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathis, Punjabi, Pashtu and Urdu.
The Radio Station is being run by M.
Vyas played an important role.
The programmes being broadcast through Azad Hind Radio were very popular in the common people and their programmes gave great strength to our freedom fighters.
A painting museum has been set up in this revolution temple.
An attempt has been made to present Indian art and culture in an extremely attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 centuries old paintings and artefacts.
The excellent artefacts of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravivarma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Gemini Roy, Salos Mukherjee have been displayed in the museum.
And I would urge you all to visit there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
Now you are thinking that there is a discussion of art here and I tell you about the best artefacts of Gurudev Tagore.
So far, we have known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as an author and musician.
But I would like to say that Gurudev was also a painter.
He has made paintings on many topics.
He has also drawn pictures of animals and birds, he has drawn a lot of beautiful natural pictures and has not only done a lot of human characters in Canvas through art.
And the special thing is that he has not named many of his pictures.
He was convinced that his painting seekers would understand the meaning of that painting, and the meaning of his message from paintings would be known from our point of view.
Their paintings have been performed in European countries, Russia and the United States.
I hope that we will definitely go to see their paintings in the Kranti Temple.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and work.
Saint Ravidas ji had given a big message from a little bit of time.
He used to say that the castes and castes of Haijo Ketan are not connected to human beings, neither the castes nor the bananas, the leaves below the leaf, then the leaves below the leaf and finally nothing comes out, but the entire tree is finished.
He used to say that if God is indeed in every person, then it is not right to share it on the basis of caste, creed and other social basis.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
Sant Ravidas ji tried to explain the importance of labour and labour through his message throughout his life.
It will not be wrong to say that he explained the true meaning of labour's prestige to the world.
My dear countrymen, Kiran Siddar has written on MyGov that I should highlight the aspects related to Indias space programme and its future.
I would like to urge the students to take a juice in the space programme and think of going beyond the sky. Kiran Ji, I appreciate the message that I have given you this idea and specially to your children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad when I was fortunate to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Dr. Vikram Sarabhai has played an important role in Indias space programme.
Our space programmes contribute to innumerable young scientists in the country.
Today, we are proud that our students have developed satellites and sounding rockets are reaching space.
On this 24th January, our students have launched Kalam-Set.
The sounding rockets made by students from the University in Odisha have set up several records.
The number of space missions that have been launched since the independence of the country till 2014, almost the same space missions have been started in the last four years.
We have also made a global record of launching 104 satellites from the same spacecraft.
We will soon showcase Indias presence on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 mission.
Our country is using space technologies to protect live and property.
Whether it is cyclone or rail and road safety, space technology is helping in all these things.
Our fishermen have been given Naval Divisions, which are also helpful in economic advancement along with their security.
We are using space technologies to improve the distribution and accountability of government services.
Under the Housing for All, nearly 40 lakh houses have been tagged in about 23 states under this scheme.
At the same time, under Manrega, about three and a half crore wealth has also been added to geo-tags.
Our satellites are today a symbol of the growing power of the country.
We have the same contribution in our excellent relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites has been an unprecedented initiative that has led our neighbouring friends to develop.
Through its unlimited competitive launch service, India is launching not only the developing country but also the satellites of developed countries.
The sky and stars of children are always a big attraction .
Our space programme gives the children an opportunity to go ahead with the limits that have been impossible till now.
Our vision is to keep our children watching stars, to explore and inspire new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always tell you that those who will play will open and this time a lot of young and young sportspersons have come forward in Khelo India.
About 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 sports events at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January.
When sportspersons perform best at the local level, they will perform best at the global level.
In Khelo India, sportspersons from every State have done well at their own level.
The life of many medal winners is inspiring.
He lives in a parking shed along with his family.
The captain of the 21-year-old women junk team of Maharashtra, Sonali Helvi Satara, was a childhood and encouraged the skills of her brother and her mirror Sonali.
It is often seen that in sports like junk, girls are not encouraged.
Despite this, Sonalin chose the junk and performed excellently.
Innovative Shaw of 10 years of Asansol, Khelo India Youth Games is the youngest gold medal winner.
The daughter of a farmer from Karnataka, Akshata Baswani Kamal, won a gold medal in his weightlifting.
His father is a farmer in Belgaum.
When we talk about building a India then the New India is a New India of the resolve of the youth power.
These stories of Khelo India are not only contributing to the creation of a New India but also to the youngsters from small towns, villages, towns, children, Young sporting talents.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many prestigious beauty contents.
This competition is called Swachh Sundar Toilet.
Besides keeping their toilets clean, making some paintings beautiful, we will be able to see the pictures of clean beautiful toilets from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Kutch to Kamrup on social media.
I urge all Sarpanches and village heads to lead this campaign in their Panchayats.
Definitely put your clean beautiful toilets on social media along with Mylzatghar.
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we started a journey to keep in mind all of us together to free the country from clean and open defecation.
Today, India is moving towards being free from open defecation long before 2nd October, 2019, with the help of every person in India, to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
Ansul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about examination and test warriors.
Ansul Ji, thank you for presenting this issue.
For many families, the first part of the year is the season of examinations.
Students, from their parents to teachers, all are busy in the work related to examinations.
I convey my best wishes to all students, their parents and teachers.
I would have liked discussions on Mann Ki Baat today but you would be happy to note that two days later on January 29, at 11 a.m. on 29th morning, the Pariksha Pe Dialogue will interact with students from all over the country and the parents and teachers will also participate in the programme.
And many students from abroad will also participate in this event.
Some of these ideas and information will be placed in front of you in the Town Hall programme.
We can also see the same life broadcast through social media and Namo App.
My dear countrymen, 30th January is the death anniversary of revered Bapu.
At 11 o'clock, the entire country pays homage to the martyrs.
We also pay homage to our martyrs for two minutes.
My best wishes to you all and my best wishes.
The year 2018 will end.
And that is why experiences are benefitted and self-confidence is also created to choose.
We can do what we can do with which we can change our lives and contribute to the society and the country.
My best wishes to you all for 2019.
You all must have decided to keep the memories of 2018 with them.
It is also important that India will be remembered as a nation in 2018 as the strength of its 1. 30 crore people.
And it is also a matter of pride for all of us.
In 2018, the worlds largest Ayushman Bharat Health Insurance Scheme was launched.
Electricity has reached every village of the country.
The world's prestigious institutions have admitted that India is working at a record pace to eradicate poverty.
With the Atal Pledge of the countrymen, the spread of sanitation is moving towards 95.

If I talk about our collective efforts for every Indian, then our Mann Ki Baat will be so long that 2019 will be destroyed.
All this has been possible only by the tireless efforts of 130 crore countrymen.
My dear countrymen, we have met some unusual Indians in December this year.
Dr. Jayendran passed away on 19th December in Chennai.
Dr. Jayendran is known as the most affordable treatment to the poor.
People say that he was ready to serve the patient.
On this website, I have read a lot of articles about his society as a motivator.
Similarly, on 25th December, the death of Sulagitinarasamma in Karnataka took place.
At the beginning of this year, he was honored by Padmasree.
There are many people like Jaichandran and Sulagitti Narasamma who have dedicated their lives for the welfare of the society.
While we are talking about healthcare, I would like to talk about the social efforts of doctors at Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, some of our party workers told me that some young doctors in the city are providing free treatment to the poor patients by organizing camps.
This kind of piercing is taken every month by the Heart Lung Critical Care here , in these camps there is facility of free treatment of many types of diseases .
Today hundreds of poor patients take advantage of these camps every month .
The enthusiasm of these young doctors who have been serving patients with selflessness is really remarkable.
Today, I am proud to say that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has been successful due to collective efforts.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh have taken up the Swachhta Abhiyan.
I have just been themeterindia.
I am sure that this will bring more and more people to know about our heroes who transform the society.
It is easy to spread negativeness .
However, many good work is being done around us in the society.
And all this is being done by the collective efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Sports is an important part of every society.
When sports are played then the minds of those who see them also get energy.
We see many things like fame, identity, respect and respect of sportspersons.
But sometimes there are many things behind them which are greater than the world of sports.
I would like to tell you about Kashmir's daughter Hanaya Nisar and she won a gold medal in the Karat competition in Korea.
Hanaya is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag, Kashmir.
Hennaya taught and practiced karat, learned and proved himself.
I pray for the bright future of all the countrymen.
Many congratulations and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, the 16-year-old Rajan had a lot of discussion in the media about this girl.
Rajan said that his fathers have sacrificed a lot to reach here and have done a lot of hard work.
Jasmer Singh used to go to work every morning before Rajni and his brother-in-law got up.
When Rajan expressed his desire to learn the foolishness, his father collected all that was possible and increased his enthusiasm.
Rajni had to use old gloves to practice the Mushtiya war because his family had to undermine the economic condition.
Despite all these obstacles, Rajni was not able to swallow up.
He has also won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini and congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha Rani for helping and enhancing her enthusiasm.
This month, a 20-year-old daughter of Pune, Vedangi Kulkarni Cycle has become the fastest Asian in the world.
He used to run around 300 kilometers of bicycle everyday for 159 days.
You imagine 300 km cycling everyday
His insistence on cycling is indeed worthy.
Whether we get inspiration from listening to such achievements or not.
Especially when my young friends listen to such incidents, they also get inspired to do something by crossing the barriers.
If we determine that there is a power in the resolution then all the problems fall on their own.
There cannot be any obstacle.
When we hear about such examples, we also get an inspiration every moment of life.
My dear countrymen, there will be a lot of festivals like Lohdi, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magh Bihu, Maghi in January.
On the occasion of all these festivals, the color of traditional dances will be seen somewhere in the Sanaurna country and somewhere iron will be burnt in the joy of Sugi.
After this the day starts increasing slowly and the season of smoothness starts in winters .
My best wishes to the farmers of our food donors.
In our festival diversity, Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is a spirit of integration in our festivals.
We can see how much our festivals have happened to nature.
In the Indian culture, society and nature are not different, there is a person and society in the same place.
The best example of our close relations with nature is the festival-based calendar.
It has not only the festivals of the year but also the information about the planet and constellations.
From this traditional calendar one gets to know how old our relationship with natural and astronomical events is .
According to the speed of the moon and the sun the number of festivals is fixed according to the moon and the sun calendar .
It depends on the calendar which calculates according to it .
Festivals are also celebrated in many parts according to the situation of Nakshatras.
Gudhi Palwa, Chettichand, Ugadi are celebrated according to the lunar calendar and Tamil Puthandu, Vishnu, Vaishakh, Baisakhi, Poila Baisak, Bihu are celebrated according to the sun calendar.
Rivers and water conservation have a special significance in many of our festivals.
Chhath is a festival of worshipping the sun in rivers and ponds.
Lakhs of crores of people also bath in the sacred rivers of Makar Sankranti .
Our festivals also teach us social daughters.
On the other hand, it has a mythological significance and on the other hand every festival inspires social brotherhood.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the year 2019 and wish you all a lot of happiness.
My dear countrymen, there are many such things in our culture which we can be proud of and show the world proud and one of these things is our Kumbh Mela.
People from abroad come there and are always connected to the Kumbh Mela.
The people of faith and devotion are looted in the Kumbh fair.
In one place, millions of people from abroad have come together.
The tradition of Kumbh Mela is accomplished and blossomed with our great cultural heritage.
From 15th January this year, the world famous Kumbh Mela is being organized in Prayagraj, which you might have been eagerly waiting for.
Saint-Mahatma Prayagraj has started reaching for the Kumbh fair since now .
Last year, UNESCO has placed the Kumbh in the list of magnificent cultural traditions of humanity and can imagine its global importance.
A few days ago, the Ambassador of many countries had come to see the preparations for the Kumbh Mela.
At that time the flag of several countries was flagged off at the same time.
There is a possibility of people from more than 150 countries coming to the Kumbh Mela organised in Prayagraj.
With the divine divinity of Kumbh, India's magnificence will embrace its colourful features throughout the world.
The Kumbh Mela is an effective medium of finding itself and every person coming here feels different.
This is a great academic experience especially for the youth.
I myself had visited Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw there that preparations for the Kumbh Mela are going on with great enthusiasm.
The people of Prayagraj are also very excited about the Kumbh Mela.
This year, the Kumbh Mela is also focusing on cleanliness.
If we look at cleanliness along with cleanliness in Kumbh events then its good message will reach far away.
This year, after the holy bath of Triveni Sangam, the devotees will also be able to visit Akshayvata.
This Akshayvat, a symbol of the belief of the devotees, was closed in a fort for several years, despite the desire, the devotees could not see it.
However, now the doors of the fort of Akshayvata have been opened for all.
I would like to urge you to upload some photographs on social media that showcase different aspects and colors of the Kumbh Mela when you will visit the Kumbh Mela, more and more people will be inspired to visit this Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of spirituality become the great Kumbh of philosophy for Indians in India.
This Kumbh of artism also becomes the Mahakumbh of creative powers.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of enthusiasm in the hearts of all our countrymen about the Republic Day celebrations of 26th January.
Revered Bapu and South Africa have an unprecedented relationship.
From South Africa itself Mohan became the Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and stood firmly against discrimination.
He also established Finics and Tolstoy Farms from where the voice of peace and justice was raised throughout the world.
The year 2018 is also being celebrated as the centenary year of Nelson Mandela and is also known as Madiba.
Nelson Mandela is one of the ideals of the war against discrimination all over the world.
He had received so many years of inspiration and inspiration from Bapu.
He considered Bapu as his ideal.
Both Bapu and Mandela not only inspire the entire world but their ideals always encourage us to create a society full of love and compassion.
My dear countrymen, just a few days ago, there was a DGP Summit in Kevadia on the Narmada coast of Gujarat, where the highest statue in the world is the Statue of Unity.
Detailed discussions on how steps should be taken to strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
At the same time, I announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for National Integration and the award will be honored with those who contribute to national unity in any way.
Sardar Patel had dedicated his entire life to the unity of the country.
He has always been trying to keep India's integrity uninterrupted.
Sardar Patel believed that India's real power is united in its diversity.
Respecting their feelings and paying homage to them through this award of unity.
My dear countrymen, January 13 is the holy day of Guru Gobind Singh ji's birth anniversary.
Guru Gobind Singh ji was born in Patna, North India was his workplace for a long time and he sacrificed his last life in Nanded in Maharashtra.
Janmabhoomi Patna, Karmabhoomi, North India and the last of life in Nanded.
In a way, the whole year of India got his blessings.
If you look at their lives then you can see the reflection of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of the Father Shri Guru Teg Bahadur ji, Guru Gobind Singh ji won the post of Guru in Alphayusha for nine years.
Guru Govind Singh ji got the courage to fight for justice in the form of a heritage from the Guru .
His personality was calm and simple but whenever he tried to smile the poor and the weak, whenever he was unjust, Guru Gobind Singh fought hard for the poor and the weak.
He used to say that it is not right to demonstrate our strength by fighting against the weaknesses.
Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji believed that it is the biggest service to remove human misery.
He was an excellent tricolor, as well as masters in many other languages including Gurumukhi, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu.
I once again salute Shri Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, there are many good things in the country which are not discussed at large.
The Indian Food Safety and Standards Authority (IFSA) is operating.
The work of promoting safe and healthy habits of food is underway.
India will be prosperous only when India is clean and healthy.
Nutritional food is the most important thing for good health .
In this context, the FSL has been awarded.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to him for this initiative taken by him.
I would like to urge you all to participate in this initiative.
I would like to say that we should also participate in it and especially show these things to the children.
It is necessary to get the education that tells the importance of food from childhood itself .
My dear countrymen, this is the last event of 2018 and I will meet you once again in the year 2019.
Be it a person or a nation or a society, the inspiration is the foundation of the progress of that life.
Let us move forward with new inspiration, new zeal, new resolutions, new achievements and new heights, move forward, change ourselves and change the country.
On October 3, 2014, on the holy occasion of Vijayadashmi, all of you had started a journey together through Mann Ki Baat.
The only man was the dramachaker.
There was nothing to do with dresses on Dhaba.
On the side of the road, he had made a tiny tap.
There was a discussion on the radio at that time.
This should be reached in the inaccessible areas of the country, from villages to metro cities, from farmers to young businessmen.
Recently, AIR has also conducted a survey on Mann Ki Baat.
I have seen the vision of the survey, some of the visions are very different and careful.
Out of those who have been surveyed, 70 of them are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Many people think that Mann Ki Baat has made a big contribution in raising positive sentiments in society.
This is a glimpse of the positive sentiment of our countrymen.
Many people have also realized that the Mann Ki Baat has led to the increase in the spirit of voluntaryism.
There has been a change that people are coming forward with great zeal and enthusiasm for social service.
I am very happy to see that the popularity of the radio is now increasing due to Mann Ki Baat.
But in this journey only radio has not remained the same medium.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
The doubt that we have presented is absolutely right.
In fact, if a leader was given a Mike to speak and lakhs of people used to listen to it then what else would happen
He studied what words were used again and again.
The studyers have concluded that this programme is not related to politics, when I started Mann Ki Baat, I had decided that there should not be any support in this programme.
I got all this inspiration from you people and from you.
In every part of Mann Ki Baat, what is the expectation of the beneficiaries from online tips and telephones.
What will happen and what will happen to Modi but this country is going to be in the forefront, our culture will remain intact.
These small things of 130 crore Indians will continue to live.
Someone from far-flung places of the country writes to me and tells me that people should not make a lot of money with small shopkeepers like us, those who run auto rickshaws and those who sell vegetables.
Now a campaign like Selfie with Dotter can be started in a small village in Haryana state and can spread not only across the country but also abroad.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government word.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India.
If you want to give a direct answer to the questions you have asked then you can say that nothing is preparing.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is a very simple task for me.
Because every time before Mann Ki Baat, I get letters from the people.
By calling this number, people also record their message in their voices.
I am trying to read more and more letters and tips before every part of Mann Ki Baat.
My countrymen, my countrymen have been living in my mind every moment and that is why whenever I read a letter, the situation of the journalist and the feelings of his mind become a part of my thoughts.
In such a situation, the letter is not just a piece of paper.
It is my voice in Mann Ki Baat, but all examples, emotions and inspirations are for my countrymen.
There are lakhs of people whom I have not been able to name in Mann Ki Baat till date but they are sending their letters without being a non-violence.
Efforts are made to keep in mind all the letters and consultations that cannot get place in Mann Ki Baat.
With their hard work, Mann Ki Baat can reach more and more people.
A team of All India Radio prepares every part for broadcasting in different languages.
Some people listen to Mann Ki Baat in the regional languages spoken in style and with the voice of Modi.
In a way, they become Narendra Modi for those 30 minutes.
I congratulate them and thank them for their talent and talent that they have shown.
I urge all of you to hear this programme in your local language too.
However, many of the topics discussed in Mann Ki Baat were also taken up by the media.
There are many topics such as cleanliness, road safety, drug-free India, selfie with doctor etc. media created new ideas and gave them the form of a campaign and worked forward in the field.
Without your cooperation, the journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
Sometimes our ancestors also stand like a big crisis in communication.
Without acceptance and response, I prefer to understand what the front person says.
The Communication Gap is usually discussed between the elderly, adults and children of Kumar Age.
In fact, in most households, Kumarvayin is also limited to discuss children and children.
It has been discussed for a long time in the study of children or their habits and their livelihood.
I have always been trying to learn what they are doing or how these children think about, whether they can learn something new from them.
Finally, this is the New India.
Some people believe that the younger generation wants to do many things at the same time.
I say, what's wrong with this
These youngsters have shown the courage to ask questions and see great dreams. These changes have been made by those youngsters.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to Vineeta ji has written on Maigava that I should talk about the Constitution Day that will be held on 26th November in Mann Ki Baat.
They believe that this day is very special because we have accepted the Constitution, it has now been 69 years and will be entering the 70th year.
Just imagine that within three years, these great personalities have created such a comprehensive and detailed event.
The way these great people have created such a speedy deficit, this work is still an excellent example of their management and productivity.
The special thing in our Constitution is that rights and duties are detailed in detail.
In the lives of the citizens, the synergy of these two will take the country forward.
If we respect and respect the rights of others then our rights will be protected by ourselves. Similarly, even if we follow our duties in the Constitution, our rights will be protected automatically.
I still remember that when the Republic of India was 60 years old, in 2010, we had taken a grand beauty visit by putting an elephant constitution in Gujarat.
In order to create awareness about the Constitution in the youth and to make them aware of the important aspects of the Constitution, our efforts to connect them to the Constitution have become memorable.
And let us ensure Peace, Progress, Prosperity, Peace, Progress and Prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, when we are discussed about the Constitution Committee, we can never forget the contribution of the great man.
This was a great man, a revered Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar
His Mahaparinirvana Diwas is on 6th December.
What is the Republic and how the parliamentary system is, it is not a new thing for India.
He said that this freedom we have achieved after such a struggle is invaluable and we have to protect our blood from the last drop.
"India First" is Dr.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, all of you celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji and next year, in 2019, we will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv.
Guru Nanak Devji always thought of the welfare of the entire humanity.
He always showed the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony to the society.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have been instructed to celebrate this programme in large numbers.
Similarly, the 550th light festival of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated in all the countries around the world.
I remember Lakhpat Saheb Guruvada at that time.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, this Guru had suffered a lot.
However, the way the state government has worked with the help of the local people, it is going to be an ideal even today.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
But this journey will continue.
The more people will be connected with all of you, our journey will be better and pleasant.
Sometimes there is a question in the minds of people that what do I get from Mann Ki Baat
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On 31st October, the son of all of you is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and this year, the youth of the country is ready to run for unity.
I urge all of you to participate in this race for a large number of listeners.
About six months before independence, on 27th January, 1947, a picture of Sardar Patel was published on the verse of the world's famous International Month Time month.
This was a map of India which was divided into many parts.
Then more than 550 institutions were in the country.
Even though the juice of the British of India was over, he was trying to break the country in many parts and leave the country.
Time menstruations used to write that India is facing threats like violence, hypocrisy, food storage, inflation and state politics.
He further wrote the Time month that if anyone has the capacity to fill the country with solidarity and injury then they are Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
This report of Time Month was going to open many other aspects of life of iron man.
How did he arrange the rescue work after the floods in Ahmedabad in the 1920s, how he gave direction to Bardoli Satyagraha.
He has merged all institutions in India.
Whether it is Junagarh or Hyderabad, Travancore or the ideological maturity and strategic skills of the Rajvati-Sardar Patel of Rajasthan, we can see India together today.
We naturally remember Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel after seeing this nation built in a united bond.
On 31st October this year, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel will be even more special. On that day, we will dedicate the statue of unity to the nation while paying homage to Sardar Patel.
The statue built on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in America.
This statue is the world's highest sky magnificent statue.
Every Indian will now feel proud that the world's highest effigy is in India.
Sardar Patel, who had a relationship with the land, will now increase the beauty of the sky.
My dear brothers and sisters, Yesterday, all of you have celebrated Infantry Day.
This is the same day on which the Indian Armed Forces landed on the land of Kashmir and protected the Gulf from smugglers.
This historic event has a direct link with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old childhood of India's great army officer Sam Manikshaw.
During that childhood, Field Marshal Manikshaw reminded him of the time he was Colonel.
It is also the death anniversary of our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi on 31st October.
Homage to Indira ji.
My dear countrymen, who does not like sports
Spirit, Strength, Skill and Stamina are all important in the world of sports.
The youngsters of the country who have these qualities will not only progress in the fields of economy, science and technology but also in sports.
Our Para athletes who participated in the Asian Para Games 2018 had the opportunity to visit.
India won a total of 72 medals in the competition and enhanced Indias honour.
I was fortunate to meet all these talented Para athletes individually and congratulated them.
Similarly, the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina had the opportunity to meet.
You will be happy to hear that in Youth Olympics 2018, our youngsters have made the best of achievements till now.
In this competition, we won three more medals in Mix types besides 13 medals.
You must remember that India's performance in the Asian Games this year has also been good.
See, how many times I used the best and most glorious words till now while speaking for a few minutes.
This is the story of Indian sports, which is attaining new heights every day.
India is not only in sports but also in those areas which have never been considered.
For example, I would like to tell you about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur, who has won a gold medal in the 2018 Asian Para Games for the country in Athletics.
They are Divyangs from birth.
When he was eight years old, he was his father.
After eight years he was taken out in an orphanage .
After leaving the orphanage, he worked as a Veter in the DTC buses and the roads in Delhi.
Today, the same Narayana is winning gold medals for India in international competitions.
Not only this, look at Indias greatest performance in sports, India has never won any Olympic medal at Judo at a cineer or junior level.
However, Tababi Devi won the Judot Silver Medal in Youth Olympics and made history.
The 16-year-old young sportsperson Tababi Devi will live in a village in Manipur.
Their father is a labourer and the mother does the job of selling fish.
Many times his family had such a time that he had no money for food.
In such a situation, the morale of Tababi Devi has not fallen.
And he made history by winning medals for the country.
There are so many stories.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson and his stubbornness are the identity of a New India.
My dear countrymen, we have successfully organised the FIFA 17th World Cup in 2017.
He was appreciated by the entire world for its successful sports competition.
A new record was created in the FIFA Under Seventin World Cup regarding the number of audiences.
More than 12 lakh people enjoyed football competitions in different stadiums of the country and increased the enthusiasm of young sportspersons.
This year, India has got the privilege of organizing the Men's Hockey Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Cup is scheduled to start in November 2018 and will continue till 16th December.
Every Indian is sportsperson or sportsperson, there is an intimacy in his mind towards hockey.
The history of India in Hockey has been written with gold.
Earlier, India has got gold medals in many competitions and once India has been a World Cup winner.
India has also given hockey a number of great sportspersons.
When Hockey is discussed in the world, the story of Hockey will remain incomplete without this great player of India.
Major Dhyanchand, the magician of Hockey, knows the whole world.
After that, Hockey has made a big journey from Balvinder Singh Sinior, Lesley Glorius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pilla.
Even today, team India players are inspiring the new generation of Hockey from the success of their hard work and dedication.
For sports lovers there is a good opportunity to see thrilling faces .
He should visit Bhubaneswar and encourage not only Indians but also other unions.
During this time along with enjoying sports you can also see the Sun Temple of Konark , Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri and many world famous visiting and sacred places along with Chilka lake .
I convey my best wishes to the Indian men's hockey team for this competition and assure that 125 crore Indians stand for their support and support.
I convey my best wishes to all the world teams coming to India.
My dear countrymen, the kinds of people who are serving for social work are inspiring and enthusiastic for all the countrymen.
But in the new era, new generations, new hopes, new zeal and new dreams are coming forward today.
A few days ago, I had visited a programme where a portal has been launched, its name is Self-For Society, MyGov and the IT and electronic industry of the country have started this portal to encourage our employees to provide them such opportunities for social initiatives.
Every Indian will be proud to see the zeal and spirit that he has for this work.
It has a smell of the journey from IT to society, not I am, not the age and the journey from self to community.
Anyone who is teaching children, who is teaching senior citizens, who is engaged in cleanliness, who is helping the farmers and is a selfless feeling of dedication and commitment.
A young man himself learned Wheelchair Basketball to help the Wheelchair Basketball team of Divyangjans.
This feeling, dedication is a rapid initiative for special work.
Will no Indian be proud of this thing
My dear brothers and sisters, when I had seen the people's information about Mann Ki Baat, I got to see an interesting copy of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Puducherry.
He has written on MyGov that please tell us that in Mann Ki Baat, the traditions and traditions of many people of India are the best examples of co-existence with nature.
There is a need to teach them how to adopt their traditions in our lives for sustainable development.
Manish ji, I appreciate you for this theme Mann Ki Baat.
This is a matter that inspires us to see our glorious history and culture, today the world, especially the Western countries, are discussing environmental protection and finding new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
However, we have not been able to get rid of this problem even in India, but to solve it, we have to see our rich history, traditions and especially the lifestyle of our tribal communities.
It has been a part of our tribal culture to keep an agreement with nature.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees and flowers like goddesses.
In the Bhil tribal tribe of Central India, especially in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship trees like Pimpal and Arjun with respect.
In the desert like Rajasthan, the Vishnoi society has shown us the way for environmental protection.
They are not allowed to sacrifice their lives especially for the protection of trees, but they are not allowed to harm the same tree.
Mishmi claims to have a relationship with tigers in Arunachal Pradesh.
He considers them as brothers and sisters.
Tigers in Nagaland are seen to be the protector of forests .
The people of the Varili community of Maharashtra consider the tiger as a guest and the presence of tigers for them is prosperous.
The Col community of Central India believes that their own fate is linked to the tigers, tigers do not have food but the villagers will have to stay hungry.
In the reproduction season of the Gond tribal fish of central India fishing stops in some parts of the Kethan river .
In southern India, on the Nilgiri Plains, a small slaughter community is broken in the remote areas and traditionally their colonies are made up of locally available items.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community insists on living together in a very peaceful and comprehensive manner, but if someone harms their natural resources, then they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that our first freedom fighters were among the tribal communities.
Who can forget Lord Birsa Munda who fought strongly against the British government to protect our wild land.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we talk about those individuals and institutions who have done something unique for the society.
This kind of work looks very funny, but in reality, our mindset changes have a very deep impact on the direction of society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother Gurbachan Singh of Punjab.
A common farmer was married to Gurbachan Singh ji.
Before marriage, Gurbachan ji had said that we are doing a simple way to marry the bride's daughter-in-law.
There is no need to spend much on top and other things.
We have to celebrate this issue in a simple manner.
But he suddenly said, but I have one end.
Nowadays, when there is a subject of marriage then it is common that something is going to demand a bigger demand in front of us. Some such things will be left behind by the bride's family.
But you will be surprised to know that this was a simple farmer and what he said is the real power of our society.
Gurbachan Singh ji said to me that we will never burn peacock in our fields.
We can imagine how big a social force is there in it.
And we have seen that there are many families in our society who transform their personality into social interest.
The family of Mr. Gurbachan Singh ji has set a similar example in front of us.
I have read another village in Punjab in Kallar Majra, which is near Nabha.
Kallar Majra is being discussed for the reason that instead of burning the cereals, they mix in the mud of the cereals and the technologies that are required to be used for them.
Congratulations to Bhai Gurbachan Singh ji.
Congratulations to all those who are making best efforts to keep the environment clean.
You are leading the Indian tradition of a strong lifestyle as a true heritage.
Like the drops and drops of the sea, small activism and awareness and positive work play a big role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen , it has been said in our texts : Divya Shanti Shanti , Prithvi Shanti : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Visvadeva : Peace : Brahma Shanti , Visvadeva : Peace : Brahma Shanti , Peace , Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace : Peace , Peace . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Establish peace in life, in heart, in me, in you, in every part of the world.
Peace: Peace: When world peace is discussed, India's name and contribution will be seen in the golden signature.
India has a special significance for 11th November, as the first great war ended 100 years ago on 11th November.
The event is about 100 years, that is, the devastation and human damage that took place during that period will be completed by a century.
The first war for India was an important event.
In fact, we did not have to give anything directly to that war.
However, our soldiers fought bravely and played a very big role and sacrificed the highest.
Indian soldiers showed the world that the war was not less than anybody.
Our soldiers have shown valour in the remote areas and in the opposite situations.
In all this, the only objective was to re-establish peace.
In the first great war, the world has seen all the evils.
According to the estimate, about one crore soldiers and so many civilians lost their lives.
This has led to the importance of peace in the world.
The interpretation of peace has changed in the last 100 years.
Peace and harmony today is not just a war.
From terrorism to climate change, from economic development to social justice, all need to work with global cooperation and coordination.
The development of the poorest of the poor is the true symbol of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-Eastern India is different.
The natural beauty of the North-East is unique and the people here are very talented .
Our North-Eastern India is known for the best work.
North-Eastern India is such a region that has made a lot of progress in organic farming.
A few days ago, Sikkim has won the Future Policy Gold Award 2018 to promote sustainable food system.
The award is conferred on behalf of the Food and Agricultural Organisations (FAOs) associated with the United Nations.
You will be glad to hear that the award for making the best policy is with Oscar in the field.
Not only this, I congratulate the people of Sikkim for winning this award by keeping our Sikkim behind the 51 beneficiaries of 25 countries.
My dear countrymen, October has ended.
The climate change is becoming very big.
My best wishes to all the countrymen for these festivals.
I urge you to take care of yourself during these festivals, take care of your health and keep an eye on social interest.
This festival is an opportunity to take new decisions.
There should be an opportunity in our lives to resolve to move forward in the mission mode.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The more you progress will be the progress of the country.
