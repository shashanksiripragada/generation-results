My dear countrymen, greetings
My best wishes to you all on Diwali
We have said - Shubham Karoti Kalyan Arogya Dhanasampadam
How excellent is the message in this verse it has said that light comes with happiness, health and prosperity in life, which shows goodwill by destruction of opposite intelligence.
I bow down to such a divine light
To remember this Deepawali, what can be better ideas than that we extend light, spread positiveity and pray to destroy the spirit of hostility
Nowadays Diwali is celebrated in many countries of the world .
The special thing is that it includes not just the Indian community, but now the governments of many countries, the citizens there, the social organizations there celebrate Diwali with full joy.
In a way , India stands there .
Friends, festival tourism has its own attraction in the world.
Our country, which is the Country of Festivals, also has immense potential for festival tourism.
It should be our endeavour to spread festivals like Holi, Diwali, Onam, Pongal, Bihu and include people from other states and other countries in the happiness of festivals.
Every state and every region have so many festivals. People from other countries are very interested in it.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is also very important in increasing festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, in the last Mann Ki Baat, we had decided that we would do something different on this Diwali.
I had said, let us all celebrate the women's power and their achievements on this Diwali, that is, the respect of India's Lakshmi.
And seeing that, immediately after that, innumerable inspiring stories were found on social media.
Ramesh of Karangal wrote on NamoApp that my mother is my power
My mother is God for me .
Everything is for me and it is in true sense the Laxmi of India
Ramesh ji, I bow to your mother
Geetika Swamy, who is active on Twitter, says that for him Major Khushboo Kanwar is the daughter of India, who is the daughter of Bus Conductor and had led the All-Commen group of Assam Riles.
For poem Tiwari ji, India's Lakshmi, her daughter, which is also her strength.
They are proud that their daughter paintings the best
He has also achieved a very good rank in the ATEL examination
Megha Jain ji has written that an elderly woman of 92 years of ninety two years of age, gives free water to passengers at Gwalior railway station for years.
Megha ji has been inspired by the humility and compassion of this Laxmi of India.
Many such stories have been shared by people .
You must read, take inspiration and share similar things with yourself and I respectfully bow down to all these Laxmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the well-known poet of the 17th century, Sachi Honnama, he wrote a poem in Kannada language, that feeling, that word, that word, every Lakshmi of India, that we are talking about.
It looks like his foundation was created in the 17th century itself.
How excellent words, how excellent feelings and how excellent ideas are in this poem of Kannada language
Pannida Parmegondanu Himavantanu, Pannida Bhrigu Parchidanupennida Janakrayanu Jasuvalidanu (Pennida Permegondanu Himavantanu.Peninda Brohohu Perchidanu Penninda Janakarayanu Jasuvalendanu), meaning Himwant i.e. Parvataraja because of his daughter Parvati, Rishi Bhrigu fame because of his daughter Lakshmi and Raja Janak fame because of her daughter Sita
Our daughters are our pride and by the greatness of these daughters, our society has a strong identity and a bright future.
My dear countrymen, this is the day on 12th November, 2019, the 550th Prakash Celebration of Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be celebrated all over the world.
The influence of Guru Nanak Dev ji is not only in India but in the whole world .
Our Sikh brothers and sisters are inhabited in many countries of the world who are fully dedicated to the ideals of Guru Nanakdev ji
I can never forget my visits to the Gurudwaras in Vankuver and Tehran.
There is a lot about Shri Guru Nanakdevji that I can share with you, but for this there will be many episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He always kept the service paramount
Guru Nanakdev ji believed that there could be no price for service work done in selflessness .
They stood firmly against social evil like untouchables
Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji conveyed his message in the world and far-flung
He was one of the most travellers in his time .
He went to many places and wherever he went, he won his simplicity, humility and simplicity.
Guru Nanak Dev ji made several important religious visits, which are called sadness
With the message of goodwill and equality, they went to the north or south, east or west - everywhere, they met people, saints and saints everywhere.
It is believed that the famous saint Shankardev of Assam was also inspired by him .
He visited the holy land of Haridwar
There is a holy place in Kashi, Gurubagh Gurudwara, it is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji had stayed there.
He also went to religious places like Rajgir and Gaya associated with Buddhism .
Gurunanak Dev ji in the south, visit to Sri Lanka
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Dev ji had solved the problem of water there.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak eera Saheb in Bidar which reminds us of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, it is dedicated to him.
During a sadness, Guru Nanak ji also travelled in the north, Kashmir and its surrounding areas.
It established a very strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir .
Guru Nanak Dev ji also visited Tibet, where people, they considered him, Guru
They are also worshipped in Uzbekistan, where, they traveled.
During one of his sadness, he also visited Islamic countries on a large scale, including Saudi Arabia, I.
Just a few days ago, the Ambassador of the High Five Countries from about 85 countries had visited Amritsar from Delhi.
There he visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar and all this happened on the occasion of the 550th Prakash Parva of Guru Nanak Dev ji
All these Ambassadors had visited the Golden Temple, they also got the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions and culture.
Subsequently, many Ambassadors also wrote pridefully good experiences of sharing pictures on social medicine
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember the date of 31st October.
Sardar Patel used to look at things very deeply.
In fact, they were Man of Detail
At the same time he was also skilled in organization skills
He had great mastery in formulating plans and formulating strategy
When you read and listen about Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, you know how tremendous his planning was.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country were going to attend the Congress session in Ahmedabad at Nineteen Twenty One.
Sardar Patel was responsible for the entire arrangement of the session.
He also used this opportunity to improve the water supply network in the city.
He approached the farmers and urged them to make Khadi bags
Farmers made bags and sold to representatives
By putting shoes in these bags, keeping shoes with them, the tension of shoes stolen from the delegates' mind ended.
On the other hand , the sale of khadi also increased considerably .
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constituent Assembly.
He played an important role in ensuring fundamental rights, so that there is no scope for any discrimination based on caste and sect.
Friends, We all know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a great work to unite the princely states, to unite them.
Actually, when we talk about Sardar Patel's efforts, his role is discussed in some special provinces in the integration of the country.
He also played an important role in a small place like Lakshadweep .
Immediately after the partition of India in 1947, our neighbour was on Lakshadweep and he sent a ship with his flag .
As soon as Sardar Patel got information about this, he lost the time without delaying, immediately, started strict action.
Soon after his command , the tricolor was hoisted there , and destroyed every neighbour ' s plan to capture Lakshadweep .
After this incident, Sardar Patel asked Mudaliar Brothers to personally ensure that Lakshadweep gets every necessary help for development.
Today, Lakshadweep is contributing to Indias progress.
This is also an attractive tourist destination .
I hope all of you will visit its beautiful islands and beaches.
My dear countrymen, the day of October 31, 2018, the Statue of Unity built in memory of Sardar Sahib was dedicated to the country and the world.
This is the world ' s highest statue .
The Statue of Liberty located in the United States is double at a height
The highest statue of the world fills every Indian with pride .
Every Indian ' s head rises above glory .
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh tourists, State of Unity in a year.
This means that every day an average of eight and a half thousand people showcased the grandeur of the State of Unity.
He expressed the faith and faith in Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and now there are several centres of attraction such as Actus Garden, Butterly Garden, Jungle Saari, Children Nutrition Park, Ekta Nursery and these centres are constantly developing and it is also encouraging the local economy and people are getting new employment opportunities.
And keeping in mind the convenience of the tourists coming, many villages are providing facilities to their homes, to their homes.
Professional training is also being given to people providing women-stay facilities.
The people there have now started cultivation of ragon ruit and I am sure it will soon become the main source of livelihood for the people there .
Friends, For the country, for all the states, for the tourism industry, this state of unity can be a subject of study.
We all are witnesses to how one place within a year develops as a world famous tourism destination.
There people come from abroad .
Transports, lodging, guides, eco-friendly arrangements, each other has been developing a lot of arrangements on its own.
Very big economy is developing and people are creating facilities as per the requirement of passengers.
The government is also playing its role
Friends, As you know, National Integration Day is celebrated on 31st October every year since 2014.
This day gives us the message of protecting the unity, integrity and security of our country at every cost.
Run for Unity is also being organized every time on 31st October.
It will include every section of the society, every section of the society.
Run for unity is a symbol of this, this country is one in one direction and wants to achieve one goal.
One goal - One India, Shreshtha Bharat.
It has been seen in the last five years - not only in Delhi but in hundreds of cities of India, in the Union Territories, in the capitals, in the district centres, in the smaller tier-to-tier-three cities, even in the smaller tier-to-tier city, there is a lot of men, women, people of the city, people of the villages, children, youths, elderly people, people of Divyangjan, all are joining a large number.
Anyway, nowadays, people are getting to see a hobby and junnn about marathon.
Run for unity is also a unique provision
Running is beneficial for mind and mind and body all .
It's also to run here.
We also realise the feeling of India, as well as the Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat. We also join this purpose.
And that is why not just body, mind and rituals to bring India to new heights for the unity of India
And that's why you can know about the run for unity around you wherever you live in.
This portal has been informed about places across the country where run for unity is to be organized.
I hope that you will surely run on 31st October - for the unity of India, for the fitness of God.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel binds the country into the formula of unity
This mantra of unity is like a ritual in our life and in a country full of diversity like India, we should continue to strengthen this mantra of unity at every level, at every stage, at every stage and at every stage.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and cautious to empower the unity and mutual goodwill of the country.
If we look around us, we will find many examples that have been working continuously to increase mutual harmony, but many times it happens that the efforts of the society, its contribution, the memory table becomes very soon.
Friends, I remember that in September 2010, when the Allahabad High Court ruled on Ram Janmabhoomi
Interest Groups were playing games to take advantage of those situations in their own way.
To create warmth in the atmosphere, what kind of language was spoken
But all this, five days, seven days, ten days continued, but, as soon as the decision came, a joyous, surprising change was felt by the country.
On one hand, everything was done for warmth for two weeks, but when the decision on Ram Janmabhoomi came, the government, political parties, social organizations, civil society, representatives of all sects, saints and saints gave a very balanced and restrained statement.
Whenever I remember that day I feel happy .
Respected the dignity of the judiciary very proudly and did not allow any warmth to become an atmosphere of tension anywhere
These things should always be remembered that they give us a lot of strength .
That day, that moment, it's a duty for all of us.
This is an example of the voice of unity, the strength of the country and the strength of the country.
I also pay homage to them today.
My dear countrymen, today, if a story of every household is heard away, a story of every village is heard from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from every corner of India, then it is the story of cleanliness.
But there is also a pleasant experience and an interesting experience .
I heard, I think, I'll tell you, too.
You imagine, the world's highest battlefield, where the temperature goes from minus 50-60 degrees minus.
Yogen is also named in the air .
In such a opposite situation, living in the midst of such challenges is not less than any valour.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the boundaries of the country, but are also running clean Siachen campaigns there.
I appreciate the countrymen for this wonderful commitment of the Indian Army.
I am grateful .
There ' s so cold that anything is difficult to decompose
In such a situation, separating and managing waste is a very important task in itself.
In such a situation, removing 130 tonnes and more waste from the glacier and its surrounding areas and how big is the service between the regular eco-system here.
We all know that Siachen is a glacier that is a source of rivers and clean water, so it means running a clean drive here to ensure clean water for those who live in the lower areas.
Also use water of rivers like Nubra and Shiyok
My dear countrymen, Festival is a festival awakening a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Diwali, particularly buying something or the other, bringing something from the market is the least in every family.
I had once said that we should try - buy local things
If we meet our village, we do not need to go to Tehsil.
If you meet in tehsil then there is no need to go to the district
As much as we will try to buy our local things, Gandhi 150 will become a great opportunity in itself.
And I urge you to buy something or the other from the hands of our weavers, from the hands of our khadi people.
Even in this Diwali, you might have bought a lot before Diwali but there are many people who think that if they go after Diwali then they will probably get a little cheaper too.
And there will be a lot of people who will be bought yet .
So with the best wishes of Deepawali, I will urge you to come here to urge us to buy locals and buy local things.
See, how important can we play in fulfilling Mahatma Gandhi's dream
Once again, I extend my best wishes to you on the auspicious festival of Diwali.
In Diwali , we use firecrackers like it .
But, sometimes there is a fire in carelessness
somewhere gets injury
I urge you all to take up yourself and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm .
My best wishes
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Will he control his own life and fate from it
Puja Bapu can remember that Jantar
Can we think while buying what I am buying will benefit the citizens of my country
Today the whole country is celebrating Rakshabandhan festival
My best wishes to all the countrymen on this auspicious festival
The festival of Rakshabandhan is considered to be a symbol of mutual love and belief of sister and brother .
This festival has been a great example of social harmony for centuries .
There are many stories in the history of the country, in which a defense formula had linked people associated with two different states or religions with faith.
Just a few days later, the festival of Janmashtami is going to come
The entire atmosphere is going to elephant, horse, palanquin Jai Kanhaiyalal, govinda-Govinda's jealousy.
The joy of swimming in the color of Lord Krishna is different .
Apart from Rakshabandhan , Sanskrit Day is also celebrated on the day of Shravan Purnima .
I congratulate all those who are engaged in bringing this great legacy to the common man.
Every language has its own importance, India is proud that Tamil language is the oldest language in the world and we all Indians are proud that from the Vedas to the present, Sanskrit language has played a very big role in the spread of knowledge.
Knowledge associated with every region of life is in Sanskrit language and its literature .
Whether it is science or technology, agriculture or health, estronomy or architecture, mathematics or management, economics or environment, they say that the mantra of dealing with the challenges of global farming is detailed in our Vedas.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Mattur village in Shivmoga district of Karnataka state still use Sanskrit language for talks .
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language in which the creation of infinite words is possible
Sometimes they use lions and lions but those who are familiar with Sanskrit auspicious people know that such an accurate statement in very few words happens with Sanskrit auspicious people and otherwise it is very easy to understand because of being associated with our earth and our tradition.
As has been asked to explain the importance of the guru in life - although Akshramastu, Guru : disciples Prabodhyet
All of us celebrate the coming Teachers Day with this feeling
The whole country celebrates his birth anniversary as Teachers Day .
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the coming Teachers Day and also congratulate your dedication to science, education and students.
Trees and plants scorching from the heat give relief to dry reservoirs, but sometimes it also brings overwhelming and destructive floods
There is a situation of nature that in some places there was more rain than other places .
The severe flood in Kerala has badly affected people's lives
Today the whole country stands with Kerala in these difficult circumstances .
Our condolences are with those families who have lost their lives, the losses of their lives cannot be compensated but I want to assure the bereaved families that 1. 25 billion Indians are standing shoulder to shoulder with you in this hour of sorrow.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural calamity will go to health as soon as possible.
I am confident that Kerala will soon stand up again with the strength and courage of the people of the state.
Everyone from Kutch to Kamrup and Kashmir to Kanyakumari is doing something or the other at their own level so that wherever there has been objection, be it Kerala or other districts of India and be it areas, people's life can be normal again.
All the age groups and people associated with every workforce are contributing to them.
Everyone is engaged in ensuring that the trouble of the people of Kerala can be minimized, we share their sorrow.
We all know that the armed forces are the heroes of the ongoing rescue operations in Kerala
They did not leave any stone unturned to save people trapped in the flood
I also want to specifically mention the hard work of the NCR junks .
He has done excellent work in this moment of crisis .
Efforts to meet the situation by making their commitment and quick decisions have become the centre of a new devotion for every Indian.
Yesterday was the festival of Onam, we will pray that the festival of Onam will give strength to the country especially to Kerala so that they can recover from this calamity as soon as possible and the development journey of Kerala will speed up.
Once again, I would like to assure the people of Kerala and other parts of the country that the whole country is with them in this hour of crisis.
My dear countrymen
This time I was looking at the suggestions that came to mind .
Then the topic on which the people of the country wrote most is the topic of all of us, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, Bhai Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapna Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, how many countless people have written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App and on MyGov and urged me to talk about various aspects of Atal ji's life.
As soon as the country and the world heard the news of Atal ji's demise on August 16, everyone was drowned in mourning
A nation leader who left the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago
In a way , for the last 10 years , he had gone far from active politics .
They didn't see anywhere in the news, they didn't see publicly
For the past several days, the best aspects of Atal ji have come to the country .
People have remembered him as best MP, sensitive writer, best speaker, popular Prime Minister.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 91st Amendment Act.
This change made two important changes in India ' s politics
Firstly , the size of the Cabinet in the States was limited to 15 of the total assembly seats .
Secondly, the limit fixed under anti-party law was increased from one-third to two-thirds.
At the same time, clear guidelines were also set for disqualification of brokers.
For many years, the political culture of constituting a huge cabinet in India was made not only for the sharing of big jamboo cabinet work but for the pleasure of politicians.
Atal ji changed it
This step saved money and resources
With this, efficiency also increased
It was a long vision like Atal ji who changed the situation and flourished healthy traditions in our political culture.
Atal ji was a true patriot
During his tenure the time of presenting the budget was changed .
Earlier, according to the tradition of the British, the budget was presented at 5 o'clock in the evening because at that time there was time for Parliament to start in London .
In 2001, Atal ji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 am to 11 am
Several rules have been made in this code, which made it possible to hoist the tricolor at public places.
Because of this, more and more Indians got the opportunity to hoist their national flag
Thus they brought our beloved tricolor near to the people .
Similarly, nowadays you are seeing that discussions on the elections of the Center and the States together in the country are moving forward.
People in both sides and opposition of this subject are talking about themselves
This is a good thing and a good sign for democracy .
I must say that for a healthy democracy, developing good traditions for better democracy, striving for strengthening democracy, pursuing discussions with an open mind, this will also be a great tribute to Atal ji.
Reiterating his resolve to fulfill his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I pay homage to Atal ji on behalf of all of us.
Monsoon session of Parliament ends just a few days ago
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and Rajya Sabha was 74.
All MPs tried to make the monsoon session more and more useful by rising above the Dalhit and the result of this is that the Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and Rajya Sabha passed 14 bills
This monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session of social justice and the welfare of youth
Several important bills which benefit youth and backward communities were passed in this session
You all know that for decades, the demand for creating a BCC commission was going on just like the SST Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of backward classes, the country has fulfilled the resolution to form the BCC this time and gave it a constitutional right too.
This step will prove to be taking forward the objective of social justice .
The work of passing the Amendment Bill to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was done in this session.
This law will further secure the interests of the SC and ST community
At the same time it will prevent criminals from torturing and believe in Dalit communities
No civil society can tolerate any kind of injustice against the women power of the country .
The culprits of rape are not ready to tolerate the country, so Parliament has passed the Criminal Law Amendment Bill and provided the rigorous punishment.
The culprits of misbehavior will be punished for at least 10 years, they will be punished for raping girls below 12 years of age.
A few days ago , you must have read in the newspapers in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh , a court has sentenced two convicts of rape to death after just two months of hearing .
Earlier, a court in Katni of Madhya Pradesh punished the culprits after just five days of hearing
Rajasthan has also made similar decisions by the courts there .
This law will play an effective role in preventing crime cases against women and girls .
Economic progress is incomplete without social change
Though it is not possible in this session of Rajya Sabha , I assure Muslim women that the whole country stands with full force to bring justice to them .
When we move forward in the country, the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived can be changed.
In the monsoon session this time everyone has presented an ideal together .
These days, the attention of millions of countrymen is on Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every morning, people first look at newspapers, television, news, social media and see which Indian player has won the medal.
Asian Games are still running
I would like to congratulate all the medal winners for the country.
My best wishes to those sportspersons whose competition is yet to be done.
Indias sportspersons are performing excellently in shooting and restoring, but our sportspersons are also bringing medals in those games in which our performance has not been so good in the past, such as sports like Dushu and Rowing - these are not just medals - proofs - Indian sports and sportspersons touch the heavens and dreams.
The medal winners of the country include a large number of our daughters and this is a very positive sign - even among the young players who win medals are our youth of 15-16 years
It is also a very good sign that most of the players who have won medals are residents of small towns and villages and they have achieved this success with hard work .
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day. On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to all sports lovers and also pay my homage to the magician great sportsperson of Hockey, Shri Dhyanchand ji.
I urge all citizens of the country to play and take care of their fitness as a healthy India will build a rich and prosperous India.
Once again I congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and wish the rest of the players a good performance.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day
Namaste Bhavna, I respect your feelings
We all have seen houses and buildings constructed from brick stones but can you imagine that about twelve to hundred years ago, a huge mountain which was just a single stone, was given the form of an excellent, huge and wonderful temple - perhaps it was difficult to imagine, but it happened and that temple is the Kailashnath temple located in Ellora of Maharashtra.
If someone tells you that about a thousand years ago a granite pillar of more than 60 metres was built and at its peak a rock of about 80 tons of granite was placed - will you believe
However, the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this incredible mail of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone is surprised to see the queen of the 11th century in Patan of Gujarat .
India ' s Land Engineering Laboratory
There were many engineers in India who made unimaginable and presented examples called miracles in the world of engineering.
We also got a gem in our legacy of great engineers whose work is still amazing people and it was Bharat Ratna Dr. M. Visvesvaraya.
In that part of the country, he is worshipped, the rest of the country also remembers him with great respect and intimacy.
In his memory on 15th September is made as an engineers Day .
On his footprints, engineers of our country have made their own identity all over the world .
When I talk about the miracles of the world of engineering, I remember an incident of the terrible earthquake in Kutch in Gujarat today in 2001.
At that time when I used to work as a volunteer, I got the opportunity to go to a village and I got the opportunity to meet a mother of more than 100 years and she was laughing at me and she was saying, Look, this is my house.
But you don't see any harm anywhere
These houses were built by our ancestors according to the nature of this place, according to the environment here and he was saying so proudly, so I came to know that even centuries ago, the engineers of that period had composed according to the local conditions that led to which the public was safe.
Now when we celebrate the Engineers Day, we should also think for the future.
Workshops should be done at location
In the changed age what new things we have to learn
The world is battling natural calamities
So , what is the new form of cultural engineering
What are its courses
What should be taught to students
How did this become our priority
We must think of many such things when the engineers celebrate Day
There is an atmosphere of festivals and preparations for Diwali also start .
Will continue to meet in the matter of mind, will continue to talk about mind and we will continue to gather in moving the country forward with our mind.
With this spirit, my best wishes to you all
Thank you
Then they will meet .
There are reports of good rains in many places these days .
Somewhere due to excessive rains there is also anxiety and at some places people are still waiting for rain .
India's vastness, diversity, sometimes rain also shows the form of preference, but what do we blame rain, human beings who chose the path of struggle with nature and the result of it is that nature sometimes stops on us.
And that is why we all become the responsibility of nature lovers, we become the protector of nature, we become the protector of nature, we remain balanced in what nature is.
In the past, the incident of a natural calamity attracted the attention of the whole world, shocked the human mind.
You must have seen all of you on TV, the team of 12 teenage football players in Thailand and their coach went to the cave to roam
It usually takes a few hours to go to the cave and get out of it.
But on that day the fate had nothing else .
When they went inside the cave a lot of water accumulated near the gate of the cave because of sudden heavy rains .
You can imagine when death appears in front of adolescents and if you have to spend moments then how will they be
On one hand, he was battling the crisis, on the other hand, humanity was uniting all over the world and manifesting the human properties of God.
People around the world were praying to take these children out safely
Whether it is the government, the parents of these children, their families, the media, the citizens of the country, everyone has shown a wonderful conduct of peace and patience.
Everyone was engaged in his mission by becoming a team.
In this entire operation, a Thailand naval jawan lost his life.
The whole world is surprised at the fact that despite such difficult circumstances , he did not leave his hope with such courage and patience in a dark cave filled with water .
It shows that when humanity comes together, there are wonderful things.
We just need to pay attention to our goal with a calm and stable mind and work for it.
In the past, the beloved poet of our country Neeraj ji left us
Neeraj ji had a specialty - hope, trust, determination, confidence in himself
However , the months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for all the youth .
because that ' s the time when the collages have the peak season
Millions of youngsters like Satyam go from school to colleges.
If it goes to Feb and March Feams, papers, answers, then along with enjoyment in April and May vacations, results, future directions in life, carriage offices are used in this thing.
July is the month when youngsters step up in a new phase of their lives when they move away from the cost-offs.
The attention of the students goes from home to hostel
Students come in the shadow of professionals from the shadow of Parents
I am sure my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of life.
For the first time, go out of the house, go out of the village, get out of a protective environment and make yourself a partner.
For the first time so many youngsters leave their homes and come out to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students will have joined their colleges so far, some will be joining.
I will say to you people that be peace, enjoy life, enjoy the difference in life.
There is no fodder without books, you have to study, but there should be a tendency to find new things.
Old friends have their own precious value
Childhood friends are valuable, but choosing, building and maintaining new friends, it is a great understanding in themselves.
Learn some new, like new skills, learn new languages
The youngsters who have left their homes and have gone out to discover those places, know about them, the people there, the language, the culture, the tourist destinations there - go there and know about them.
My best wishes to all the youngsters are starting a new innings
His father takes care of his family by drinking garbage .
I congratulate them for their success .
There are so many students who are from the poor family and despite the opposite conditions, they have done something that inspires us all.
Ahmedabad's Bitia Afreen Sheikh, whose father runs Auto Rickshaw, Nagpur's daughter is happy, whose father is also a driver in the school bus or Kartik of Haryana, whose father is a watchman or Ramesh Sahu of Jharkhand whose father wages in brick kiln
Khud Ramesh also used to sell toys in the fair or Anushka Panda, the Divya daughter of Gurgaon, who has been suffering from a genetic disease called Spinal Muscular Catrophy since birth, all of them have achieved such success by crossing every obstacle with their determination and courage.
If we look around us , we will find many such examples .
Neeraj ji has said that the song is to recite the sky to the earth. I have to call every darkness in light. I have to head the sword with the smell of flowers, and to awaken the mountains of Ga-ga, I am my dear countrymen, a few days ago my eyes went on a news, wrote - Two youths dreamed of Modi
The incident was that once I was discussing with Indian youth in San Jose City of America, which is known as Technology Cub
I had appealed to them how they can use their talent for India, think and do something by extracting time.
I had appealed to transform Brain-Rain into Brain-Gain
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have together prepared a SmartGaon App using their professional skills.
This app is not only connecting the people of the village to the whole world but now they can get any information and information on their own mobile itself .
Residents of this village of Rae Bareli, Village Prime Minister, District Magistrate, all of them made aware about the use of this app.
If you look closely at this event, one thing will be noticed that the young man is living in the United States, his lifestyle and thoughts have left India several years ago but still he knows the nuances of his village, understands the challenges and is connected to the village with emotionality.
For this reason, he might have made something according to what the village needs.
It is natural for every Indian to do something for their villages, their roots and their roots .
But sometimes due to time, sometimes due to distances, sometimes due to ecology, a slight ashes gets accumulated on it but if a small spark is touched then all things come up once again and bring them to their past days.
Let us also check if this has not happened in our case, conditions, situations and distances have not separated us anywhere, rash has not been frozen anywhere.
Santosh ji thanks very much for your phone all.
Indeed Pandharpur Wari is a wonderful journey in itself .
Friends, Ashadhi Ekadashi, which was on 23rd July this time, is also celebrated as a grand culmination of Pandharpur Wari.
Pandharpur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra .
Almost 15-20 days before Ashadhi Ekadashi , Varkari i . e . pilgrimage goes on foot to travel to Pandharpur with the palanquins .
This journey, which is called Vari, includes millions of warries
The grooms of great saints like Sant Gyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram, keep in the palanquin, singing, dancing, playing pedestrians move towards Pandharpur
Pilgrimage travellers reach there for their philosophy of Lord Vithal who is also called Vithova or Pandurang .
Lord Vithal protects the interests of the poor, the deprived, the victims
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have immense faith and devotion.
Going to the Vithova temple in Pandharpur and the glory, beauty and spiritual joy there has a different experience .
I urge the audience of Mann Ki Baat to experience Pandharpur Vari once you get an opportunity .
Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram - countless saints are still educating people in Maharashtra
They are giving strength to fight against superstition and in every corner of India this saint tradition has been inspiring .
We get an important message of goodwill, love and brotherhood whether it is their weight or dissolution .
The mantra is found to fight the society with reverence against superstition .
These were the people who stopped the society from time to time, showed tokens and mirror and ensured that old evil practices end from our society and the rites of compassion, equality and purity come in the people.
Our Indo-Bhumi is Bahuratna Vasundhara like a great tradition of saints lived in our country, in the same way the great men dedicated to the powerful mother-Bharti had sacrificed their lives and dedicated their lives to this land.
One such great man is Lokmanya Tilak who has left a deep impression in the minds of many Indians .
We remember Tilak jis birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and confidence
They had the power and wisdom to show the mirror of their mistakes to the British rulers .
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that he tried to sedition him three times in 20 years, and this is not a small thing.
I, Lokmanya Tilak and an interesting event associated with a statue in Ahmedabad today to the people of the country.
In October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, about a hundred years ago, more than 40,000 people had welcomed him in Ahmedabad and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had got the opportunity to interact with him during his visit here and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was very impressed with Lokmanya Tilak ji and when Lokmanya Tilak ji died on 1st August 1920, he had decided that he would make his memorial in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was elected Mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and immediately he chose the Victoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilak and this is the Victoria Garden which was named after the ueen of Britain.
Finally, the statue became ready and Sardar Saheb inaugurated it not from anyone else but from 28 February 1929 - Mahatma Gandhi and the most funny thing in that inaugural function, in that speech, Pooja Bapu said that after the arrival of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipality has not only got one person but also got the courage to build the statue of Tilak ji.
And my dear countrymen, the specialty of this statue is that it is a rare idol of Tilak in which he is sitting on a chair, it is written right below Tilak. Swaraj is our birth right and I am listening to this period of the British.
With the efforts of Lokmanya Tilak ji the tradition of public Ganesh festival started .
Public Ganesh Festival became an effective medium of traditional reverence and celebrations as well as social awareness, collectivity, harmony among people and equality.
At the same time, it was a period when the country was united to fight against the British, these festivals broke the barriers of caste and sect and united everyone.
Popularity of these events increased over time.
This shows that our ancient legacy and history are still crave in our younger generation towards our heroes.
Today in many cities it happens that you can see Ganesh-Pandal in almost every street .
This is also an excellent opportunity for our youth, where they can learn qualities like leadership and organisation, they can develop within themselves.
I had requested the last time too and when I am recalling Lokmanya Tilak ji, I would once again urge you to celebrate Ganesh festival this time too, celebrate it with great fanfare, but urge you to celebrate the eco-friendly Ganesh festival.
Everything from the idol of Ganesh ji to the decorated luggage is eco-friendly and I would like to like every city to have different competitions for the Eco-friendly Ganesh festival and I would like to be rewarded and I would like to keep things on the MyGov and the Narendra Modi App for extensive publicity.
I will surely convey your word to the people .
Lokmanya Tilak awakened self-confidence among the countrymen he gave a slogan Swaraj is our birth right and we will continue to take it.
Today is the time to say Swaraj is our birth right and we will continue to take it
Every Indian should have access to good governance and good results of development
I ' m talking about Chandrashekhar Azad
Who will be such a young man in India who will not be inspired by listening to these lines, Sarfaroshi's desire is now in our hearts, it is to see how much the force is in the body, these lines inspired many young people like Ashfaq Ullah Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad.
His passion for the bravery and freedom of Chandrashekhar Azad has inspired many youth
Azad put his life on claim, but he never bowed in front of foreign rule
It was my privilege that I had the privilege of going to the village Alirajpur of Chandrasekhar Azad in Madhya Pradesh .
Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad also got the opportunity to pay homage and Chandrashekhar Azad ji was a brave man who did not even want to die with the bullets of foreigners - if he lived, he would fight and die, he would continue to die. This was his specialty.
Once again I bow down to two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, the 400-meter race in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Inland, India's brave daughter and farmer daughter Hima Das has made history by winning gold medals in that competition.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhayan, in response to my letter, emailed me from Indonesia, now she is preparing for the ASEAN games there.
-Mail writes unity that the most important moment in any athlete's life is that when he holds the tricolor and I am proud that I did it.
Unity is proud of all of us
You have illuminated the name of the country
Unity wins Gold and Brone Medal in World Para Athletics Grand Price 2018 in Tunisia
Their achievement is special because they have made their challenge the medium of their success .
Beti Ekta Bhayan in 2003, half of the lower part of her body failed due to road accident but this daughter did not lose courage and strengthened herself.
Another Divya Yogesh Kathunia ji, he has won a gold medal in Discus Throu in Para Athletics Grand Pri in Berlin and made a world record with him Sunder Singh Gurjar has also won a gold medal in Javelin.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is full of several events and festivals, but due to the weather, sometimes the disease also enters the house.
I extend my best wishes to you all for the best health, for the inspiration of patriotism, for the month of August and for several centuries of festivals.
Then surely they shall come to the point of view .
Namaskar
My dear countrymen, once again in this programme of Mann Ki Baat, I am fortunate to be with you all.
Just a few days ago a historic cricket match took place in Bangalore
You must have realized that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
It was Afghanistan's first international match and it is a matter of pride for every Indian that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
Both teams performed excellently in this match and one of the baller Rashid Khans from Afghanistan, this year.
I remember that Afghan President Mr . Ashraf Ghani had tagged me on his twitter and the people of Afghanistan were proud of his hero Rashid Khan .
I am also grateful to our Indian friends who have provided a platform to our players to showcase their skills.
Rashid represents the best in Afghanistan .
He is the asset of the world of cricket and at the same time he didn't even write it in a bit funny manner. We're not going to give it to anyone.
This match will be a memorable for all of us
Well this was the first match so it is very natural to remember but I will remember this match for some special reason .
The Indian team did something that is an example for the whole world
What can a winner team do while taking the trophy
- While taking the trophy, the team of Afghanistan, which was playing the international match for the first time, invited the team of Afghanistan and both teams took photographs together
What happens to sportsman spirit, what happens to sportsmanship - from this one incident we can experience
Sports is an incredible way to unite society and to find out the talent that our youth have.
My dear countrymen, this 21st June was a different view on the fourth Yoga Day.
The whole world looked united
Be it the European Parliament in Brussels, the United Nations Headquarters at New York, the Japanese Navy fighter ships, everywhere people can see Yoga.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, there was a historic programme of Yoga and I have been told that many asanas were demonstrated by women.
On the high snowy peaks of Ladakh soldiers of India and China perform yoga together .
Yoga works to break all boundaries and connect
Thousands of enthusiastic people from hundreds of countries went beyond caste, religion, region, color or gender and made this opportunity a big festival.
If people from all over the world were participating in Yoga Day programmes so excited, why would it not be multiplied in India
Our warriors of the Air Force embarrassed everyone by doing Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth in the middle of the sky .
The vision was that they swim in the air, not sitting in the airplane
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings or playgrounds, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
Yoga has worked beyond caste, creed and geography to unite people from all over the world. The feeling of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that we have lived for centuries
Our sage, sage, saint, who always emphasizes, Yoga has proved it in true sense.
Maximum people will make it part of their lives .
Many people on MyGov and NarendraModiApp have written to me that I should talk about the Coctors Day coming on July 1 in Mann Ki Baat this time - the right thing
We are those people who naturally worship mother as God, believe equal to God because mother gives us life, mother gives us birth, many times the doctor gives us regeneration.
The role of the doctor is not limited to treating diseases only .
Today, the doctor has a medical experiment, as well as has a deep experience about the general lifestyle trends and what it affects our health.
Indian doctors have made their identity all over the world with their capacity and skills
In the medical profession, along with hardworking, our doctors are known for solving complete medical problems.
We are lucky people who are born in this land of India .
India has a rich history, when there is no such month, there is no day in which no historic event has happened.
See, India has its own heritage everywhere
There is a saint associated with it, there is a great man, there is a famous person, everyone has their own contribution, it is his greatness.
Thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that I am coming to Magahar on 28th and whenever I was in Gujarat, you know very well the Kabirvad of Gujarat.
When I used to work there, I had also made a big national session of people associated with the tradition of a saint Kabir.
You know why Kabirdas ji had gone to Magahar
At that time there was a belief that who died in Magahar does not go to heaven
On the contrary, the body that sacrifices in Kashi goes to heaven
Magahar was considered absurd but Saint Kabirdas did not believe in this
They worked to break the same evils and superstitions of their time and so they went to Magahar and they took the tomb .
Sant Kabirdas ji stressed on social equality, peace and brotherhood through his credentials and dialects
These were their ideals .
In his compositions we find the same ideal and in today ' s era they are equally inspiring .
That means the true Peer saint is the one who knows and understands the pain of others, who do not know the sorrow of others, they are infidels.
Kabirdas ji gave special emphasis on social harmony .
They were thinking far ahead of their time .
Put it on you, mercy, all the corner
Kabir writes in another doha - where mercy is religion, where greed is sin
He said: - Do not ask the caste, ask the sadhu, ask the knowledge
Such is the greatness of the Guru and such a Guru, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev
Those who showed compassionate people, kept inspiring for centuries
Guru Nanak Dev used to say the service of the poor and the needy is the service of God .
Wherever they went , they took several initiatives for the welfare of the society .
The arrangement of a kitchen free from social discrimination where a person of every caste, creed, religion or sect could eat food and eat food only Guru Nanak Dev started this anchor system
550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Dev ji to be celebrated in 2019
I want all of us to be associated with enthusiasm and zeal
I urge you all to urge the people to celebrate the 550th light festival of Guru Nanak Dev Ji in the entire society and in the world, what new ideas, what new suggestions, what new ideas, what new ideas, what new ideas, what should be, what should be, what should be done, what should be done, what should be done, what should be done, what should be done, what should be prepared and with great pride, all of us make this light festival an inspiration festival.
My dear countrymen
India's freedom struggle is very long, is very wide, is very deep and full of countless royalties.
There is another history associated with Punjab .
In 2019, 100 years of the horrific event of Jallianwala Bagh is being completed which shamed the entire humanity.
We can all think about how to remember the 100 years of this incident, but remember the immortal message that this incident has given, this violence and cruelty can never solve any problem.
Victory is always of peace and non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice
Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App that Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's birthday is on July 6 and he wants to talk to the countrymen about Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in this program.
Raman Ji, first of all, thank you very much
It looked very good to see your interest in India's history
You know, yesterday was the death anniversary of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on June 23.
Very few people would know that in 1937, Shri Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation at the University of Kolkata in Bengali language on the invitation of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.
This was the first time that the British ruled and somebody at Kolkata University addressed convocation in Bengali language.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was India's first Industries Minister and in a sense, he had laid the foundation stone for India's industrial development, had built a strong base and had prepared a strong platform.
Dr. Mukherjee's dream was that India should be industrially self-reliant, skilled and prosperous in every field.
He wanted India to develop big industries as well as pay full attention to MSMEs, handlooms, textiles and cottage industry.
He was very passionate about the development of West Bengal .
Their understanding, discretion and activism is the result of a part of Bengal being saved and it is still a part of India .
What was the most important thing for Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the integrity and unity of India - and for this, he lost his life at the age of 52.
We should always remember the message of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's unity, with the spirit of goodwill and brotherhood, with the spirit of India's progress.
In the last few weeks, I got the opportunity to interact with the beneficiaries of various schemes of the government through video call.
Beyond files, there was an opportunity to know about the changes in the life of the people directly from them.
People told about their resolve, their happiness and grief, their achievements
I believe that this was not just a government programme for me but it was a different kind of learning experiment and what could be the moment of satisfaction with the happiness that was seen on the faces of the people during this period
When he listened to the stories of a common man (human) his foolish words, the story of his experience, what he was saying, touched the heart
Betiya Common Service Centre in remote villages is providing services from the pension to the elderly of the villages to the construction of passports.
When a sister from Chhattisgarh collects Sitafal and does business by making her office-cream.
Like Anjan Prakash in Jharkhand, millions of young people of the country are running medicine centers as well as going to nearby villages and providing affordable medicines
At the same time, a young man from West Bengal is looking for a job two-three years ago and now he is only doing his successful business.
Not only this, ten-fifteen people are also giving more jobs.
Students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Goa are working on import topics like waste management at the school's Tinkering Lab at their young age.
Do not know how many stories were there, there will be no corner of the country where people do not have to talk about their success
In such an environment, when the common man (Human) comes with new hope, new hope and incidents in his life, then he is not credited with the government .
The incident of a small girl from a small village far away also becomes an inspiration for hundred and a half million countrymen.
With the help of technology for me, a moment of spending time with the beneficiaries through video bridge has been very pleasant and inspiring and it provides satisfaction to work but also gets the enthusiasm to do more.
There is another new joy of living for the poorest of the poor, another new zeal, another new inspiration.
I am very grateful to the countrymen
40-40, 50-50 lakh people have joined this video bridge programme and you have done the work of giving me a new strength.
I once again want to express my gratitude to all of you.
I always feel that if we look around us then something or the other is good.
They are those who do good .
We can also experience the aroma of goodness .
In the past one thing came to me and this is a very unique combination .
On the one hand, where professionals and engineers are there, on the other hand, our farmer brothers and sisters associated with agriculture are working in the field.
Textile engineers came together and made a simple prosperity trust together and they activated this trust to double the income of the farmers.
Connected with farmers, planned and made successful efforts to increase the income of the farmers.
Farmers producing grains are also associated with it .
On the one hand, farmers have a key role in the entire chain from crop production to marketing and on the other hand farmers' participation in profits is an attempt to ensure their right.
Separate seed-banks have been created for the crops, good breed seeds for them.
Women see the functioning of this seed-bank, women have also been added.
I congratulate these youngsters for this innovative experiment and I am happy that these youngsters associated with the world of professionals, technology and engineering have taken the path of getting out of their scope and connecting with the farmers, connecting with the villages, connecting the fields and the fields.
Once again, the younger generation of my country, their innovative experiments and their innovative experiments that I might have to go, some people will have to know, some will not know, some will have to know.
GST is going to complete one year, the dream of the people of the country was the dream of the people of the country.
One Nation One Tax Reform, if I have to give credit to anyone for this, I will give credit to the states.
GST is an excellent example of cooperative federalism, where all the states together took decisions in the country's interest and then such a big tax reform could be implemented in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can proud that people of different political ideology sit there, people from different states sit there, states with different preferences but despite this, all the decisions taken so far have been made in the GST Council.
Before GST, there were 17 different types of taxes in the country but in this system only one tax is implemented in the entire country.
GST is the victory of honesty and also a festival of honesty
Initially, there used to be complaints of Inspector Raj in the case of tax in the country.
From Return to Rend everything happens through online information technology
With the arrival of GST, the check post has ended and the movement of goods has accelerated, which is not only saving time but also in the logistics sector.
GST will probably be the world's largest tax reform
Such a big tax reform in India was successful because the people of the country adopted it and ensured the success of GST through manpower.
Normally it is believed that such a big reform, such a large country, such a large population takes 5 to 7 years to completely stabilize it but the enthusiasm of the honest people of the country and the festival of honesty is the result of the participation of manpower within a year that these new tax systems have made their place, have achieved stability and they continue to improve with their inbuilt system as per the requirement.
Once again you have got the opportunity to be the most compassionate of the mind.
You will remember the navy's 6 women commanders, these teams have been on a sea trip for the past several months.
Navika Sagar Parikrama - G I want to talk about them
These six daughters of India, their team, more than 2ndred and City Our Days - through sea for more than 250 days.
NS Tarini has returned to India on May 21 and the whole country warmly welcomed him
He travelled in various oceans and many oceans and set a distance of about twenty thousand natural miles.
This was the first event in itself in the world .
On Wednesday, I got the opportunity to meet all these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again I congratulate these daughters for enhancing their adventure, Navy's prestige, for enhancing India's honor and especially for the world that India's daughters are not less.
Who doesn't know the sense of adventure
If we see the development journey of mankind then progress has been made in the lap of some other adventure.
Development is born in the lap of adventure itself .
I can do something, I intend to do something, to do some leaks, to do some extraordinary things, I can do something - these feelings may be less, but for ages, people get inspiration.
On May 16, 5 tribal children from an ashram-school in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Tribal students Manisha Dhurve, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Madvi, Kavidas Katmode, Vikas Soyam, a group of our tribal children climbed the highest peak in the world.
These students of Ashram-School started training in August 2017, they were trained in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh, Ladakh.
These youngsters were chosen under Mission Shaurya and they have made the whole country proud by winning the best in line with the name.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the people of Chandrapur's school, to these young friends.
Recently, 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to win Verest from Nepal
My best wishes to daughter Shivangi
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Dia became a pair of first Indian father-son to climb Verest
Not only that youngsters are climbing Verest.
Sangeeta Bahl climbed Verest on May 19 and Sangeeta Bahl is more than 50 years old
This work is not only commendable but also reflects their commitment towards cleanliness, towards the environment.
Over the years, people have been climbing Verest and there are many people who have successfully completed it.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these brave heroes and daughters of Khaskar.
Such a large number of people from every region will come forward in its support.
When I talk about it in India, I believe that the country will play as much as we will play.
On social media, people are sharing videos of Hitness Challenge and taging each other and challenging them.
In Mann Ki Baat several times you have listened to me about sportspersons and some other things and last time our heroes of Commonwealth Games, talk of their minds and talk of this programme were telling us - Namaskar Sir
Image Yadav ji, thank you very much for your phone call
It is true that the games that were sometimes a part of the lives of every child are becoming less today.
These games were particularly part of the summer holidays .
Yes, it may be that in different places they were known by different names, like now Pittu is known by many names.
Nobody knows how many names are Lagori, Satolia, Seven stones, Dicori, Satodia
There are two types of games in traditional games .
There are also out doors, indoor too.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can also be seen in these sports .
The same game is known by different names, different names.
I am from Gujarat I know there is a game in Gujarat, which is called Chomal-Isto
It is played with corianders or lime seeds or dices and with the square board of 88
This game was played in almost every state .
We used to do these games too
Who will be of us, who did not play gillie-danda in childhood
Gilli-Danda is a game played from village to cities
It is known by different names in different parts of the country .
In Andhra Pradesh it is known as Gotibilla or Karrabilla .
In Orissa it is called Gulibadi and in Maharashtra it is called Financial .
Some games have their own season
You must have seen many children, who are embarrassed, but they become very stunned while playing.
From children to grandmother, grandmother and grandmother, when they play everything then what they say is not a generation gap, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
At the same time we also know our culture and traditions
Many sports also make us aware about society, environment etc.
Through cross sourcing we can make a very big architecture of our traditional sports.
Videos of these sports can be created in which the rules of sports can be shown about the way to play.
On June 5, our country will officially host the World Environment Day on World Environment Day.
It is a very important achievement for India and it is also acknowledging Indias growing leadership in the world towards reducing climate change .
This time theme is Bet Plastic Pollution
I appeal to all of you to understand the spirit of this theme and its importance and make sure that we do not use polythene, low-grade plastic and try to reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on our nature, on the world life and on our health.
Go to the World Environment Day website wed-India 2018 and all suggestions have been given in a very interesting manner - See, know and try to bring them into your daily life.
In the last few weeks, we all saw that there was dust in different parts of the country, along with strong winds and heavy rains, which is unseasonal.
There was also a loss of life, goods and losses
We have to live in harmony with nature and live with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi had advocated every step throughout his life
When India played a key role in the OP21 and the Paris Agreement, when we united the entire world through the International Solar Alliance, then all of them had a sense of fulfilling that dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
On this Environment Day, let us all think about what can we do to make our plant clean and green
How can you move forward in this direction
Can you innovate
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends
You remember the 21st June now, not only you, but the whole world remembers June 21.
21st June is celebrated as International Day of Yoga for the entire world and it has been accepted and people start preparing months ago.
These days news is being received, all over the world is preparing to celebrate International Day of Yoga on June 21.
Centuries ago, it means that by doing regular yoga, some good qualities are like relatives and friends.
Yoga creates courage which always protects us like father .
The feeling of forgiveness arises as the mother is for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend .
Bharatrihari has said that by doing regular yoga, the truth becomes our child, mercy, our sister, self-confidence, our brother, the earth itself becomes our bed and knowledge eradicating our hunger.
When so many qualities become a companion , the yogi wins all kinds of fear .
Once again I appeal to all the countrymen to pursue their heritage of Yoga and build a healthy, prosperous and harmonious nation.
Today is 27th May the death anniversary of the first Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ji
I salute Pandit ji
The memory of this month of May is also related to another thing and that is Veer Savarkar
This was the month of May in 1857 when Indians showed their strength to the British
In many parts of the country, our youth and farmers stood up in protest against injustice while showing their bravery
The sad thing is that we have been calling the events of 1857 only a rebellion or a soldier rebellion for a long time .
In fact that incident was not only reduced but it was also an attempt to push our sovereignty.
It is also a wonderful coincidence that in the month when the first freedom struggle started, Veer Savarkar ji was born in the same month.
Savarkar ji ' s personality was filled with features
A wonderful description about Savarkar ji has been done by our dearest respectable Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji .
How exactly did Atal ji depict
Savarkar took both poetry and revolution together
Being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave revolutionary
I was watching a story on T.V. of our poor daughters of the raw settlements of Sikar in Rajasthan
Our daughters, who were forced to buy garbage and ask for house-to-house - today they are learning the work of sewing and clothing the poor to cover the tannery of the poor
The daughters here today, apart from the clothing of their own and their family, are snatching from normal to good clothes.
They are also doing courses of skill development along with this.
Our daughters are self-reliant today and are living their lives with respect and have become a power for their families .
I extend my best wishes to these daughters full of hope and confidence on their bright future.
He has shown that if you are committed to do something and you are committed to it, success can be achieved in all the difficulties and this is not just a matter of Sikar. You will get to see all this in every corner of India.
If you look at your neighbourhood, you will be aware of how people defeat problems.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, enjoy the tea there, some people also have discussions and discussions.
These discussions are also political, social, film, sports and sportspersons, there are also problems in the country - that there is such a problem - it should be solved - but often these things are limited to discussions but some people are those who move forward in the direction of making changes from their work, their hard work and passion.
D. Prakash Rao, who lives in the slums of Cuttack city of Orissa, has a similar story of making the dreams of others their own and fulfilling them.
Yesterday I got the privilege to meet D. Prakash Rao
D. Prakash Rao has been selling tea in the city for the last five decades
They arrange education, health and food for all children coming to school
I congratulate D. Prakash Rao for his hard work, his passion and a new direction to the lives of those poor children.
They have destroyed the darkness of their life .
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for the society and for the entire country.
Let us proceed with positiveness
There is so much heat in the month of June that people wait for rain and in this hope they look at clouds in the sky .
A few days later people will wait for the moon .
Moon appearance means that Eid can be celebrated .
After one month of fasting during Ramzan the festival of Eid symbolizes the beginning of the celebration .
I am sure that all people will celebrate Eid with full zeal, the children will get specially good Eid on this occasion.
I hope the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bond of goodwill in our society .
Best wishes to everyone
My dear countrymen, thank you all very much
Then I will meet in the matter of mind the next month
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
V.
Connect it to India, let it leave India and I am very happy that people are connecting with it with great enthusiasm and many people have written to me showing their support for this, sending letters, sending their letters on social media, it is India stories. A gentleman Shriman Shishikant Bhosle has written sharing a picture of swimming pole - My weapon is my body, my element is water, my world is swimming.
Ruma Devnath writes Morning Walk I feel happy and healthy and she says further - for my fitness comes with a smiles and we should smile, when we are happy.
Make an opportunity to learn these holidays for a new experience, my dear countrymen
When we hear that in the future there are wars of water in the world , everybody speaks this , but is there any responsibility for us
Do we not think that water conservation should be a social responsibility
That is, the responsibility of the person who has knowledge is that I do not know the Bengali language with the curiosity, but when I was small, I was a habit of getting up very quickly - from childhood and the radio starts early in eastern India. In West India, if it starts late in the morning, I guess thick and thick.
Rabindra Music started at 30 o'clock in the morning, and I did not know the language was used to wake up early in the morning and listen to Rabindra Music on the radio. And when I got the opportunity to listen to these poems, when I got the opportunity to listen to these poems, I would like to pay homage to Rabindra Nath Thakur, my dear countrymen.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian, we should be proud that India is the land of Lord Buddha, who guided millions of people all over the world, this Buddha Purnima reminds us of all of us of trying to walk on the path of Lord Buddha, to pledge and to walk on their path. Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
Ambedkar insists that Lord Buddha has been inspired by his social philosophy, he had said that my social philosophy may be Said to be sensitive in three words
Today is the sacred festival of Ramnavami
My best wishes to the countrymen on this holy festival of Ramnavami.
We have seen the power of Ram in the life of revered Bapu every moment in his life .
On January 26, when all the dignitaries of the ASEAN countries were here, they had come with them with a cultural group and it is a matter of great pride that most of them were presenting Ramayana to us.
This means that Ramayana and Ramayana are not only in India but also in the ASEAN Countries in this region of the world.
Once again I extend my best wishes to all of you on Ram Navami.
My dear countrymen, like every time, I have received all your letters, emails, phone calls and comments in large quantities.
Komal Thakkar ji on MyGov - I read what you wrote about starting on-line courses of Sanskrit.
Besides being a T professional, it was very good to see your love for Sanskrit.
I have asked the concerned department to bring you information about the efforts being made on this side .
The listeners of Mann Ki Baat who work on Sanskrit will also request them to consider how to advance the suggestions of Somal ji
Mr. Ghanshyam Kumar ji, Village Barakar, District Nalanda, Bihar - read comments on your Narendra ModiApp
The concern you have expressed on the declining water level in the ground is of course very important.
You have also urged everyone to keep water for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal Ji, I have conveyed your feelings to all the audience.
Mr. Yogesh Bhadresha ji, he says that I should talk to the youth about their health this time.
They think that compared to the ASEAN countries, our young people are physically weake.
Yogesh ji, I have thought that this time I should talk to everyone about health in detail.
In the past, the President of the Rancee visited Kashi, Shri Prashant Kumar of Varanasi has written that all the scenes of that visit were about to touch the mind and were about to create an impact.
And, he had urged them to propagate all the photographs, all the video and social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India had shared those photographs on social media and Narendra Modi App on the same day.
Angha, Jayesh, I want to tell you all the children that these letters make me feel fatigue all day long.
So many letters, phone calls, comments, whatever I have read, whatever I have heard and there are many things that I have touched my mind.
This time most of the letters are from children who have written about Feam
The holidays have their plans, shared
Worried about the water of animals and birds in summer
There are letters of farmer brothers and sisters about the activities that are going on across the country for farmers' fairs and farming.
Some active citizens have sent suggestions about water conservation
Our festivals, our culture and our traditions come in the festival season.
That is, things of mind change with the weather and perhaps it is also true that things of our mind change the weather in somebody's life.
And why not change
It has the power to change the climate of the whole country .
13 years ago, due to lack of timely treatment, the sister of Saidul Laskar of Kolkata died - she decided to build a hospital so that no poor died due to lack of treatment.
Sadul sold house ornaments in his mission, collected money through donation
In this way, after 12 years, the Bhagirath effort made by Sadul Laskar brought the color and today due to his hard work, due to his resolve, he is ready to become a hospital with a capacity of about 30 beds in Punri village near Kolkata.
Several such inspirations introduce my country
Today, in the country, in the youth, in the women, in the backward, in the poor, in the middle class, every section of the country has awakened the belief that yes
We can move forward, our country can move forward
There is a positive atmosphere of self-confidence full of hopes and hopes.
This self-confidence, this positivity, our resolution of New India will be fulfilled, the dream will be fulfilled.
My dear countrymen, the next few months are very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhary Charan Singh ji, Chaudhary Devilal ji - everyone considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and common life of the country.
This feeling reflects how much Mahatma Gandhi was attached to soil, fields and farmers, when he had said - To Forget How to dig up the Earth and to tend the soil, is to forget ourselves. That is, if we forget to dig the earth and take care of the soil then it is like forgetting ourselves.
Similarly, Lal Bahadur Shastri used to often emphasize the need for the protection of trees, plants and vegetation and better agricultural infrastructure.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia had spoken of mass awareness for better income, better irrigation facilities and ensuring food and milk production for our farmers.
This state with less area has done a big job .
Our farmers of Meghalaya have produced records during 2015-16 over the last five years.
He has shown that when the goal is set, the courage is strong and the resolve in the mind can be proved, it can be shown.
In the letters I had received, I was seeing that many farmers had written about MSP and they wanted me to talk to them in detail on this.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to provide farmers a fair price for crops.
It has been decided that MSP for notified crops will be declared at least one and a half times their cost.
Its efforts are being made to connect the local mandis of the villages, holessale markets and then global markets.
Farmers do not have to go far to sell their produce - for this, 22,000 rural haats of the country will be integrated with APM and e-NAM platform while upgrading them with infrastructure.
That is, in a way, connectivity with any market of the country is being created from the farm.
My dear countrymen, this year the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi will start.
How does the country celebrate this festival
Besides, Swachh Bharat is our resolve, how can one and a half million countrymen pay the best tribute to Gandhiji by mixing shoulders
You all urge me to share your views on this through MyGov.
What is the logo of Gandhi 150
What should be slogan or mantra or ghosh-style
Give your suggestions about this
Together, we all have to pay a memorable tribute to Bapu and remember Bapu and inspire him to bring our country to new heights.
Tell us something about how institutions are mobilising. Thanks. Thank you, you have said right and I believe that Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat are complementary to each other.
Today the country has moved ahead of the conventional approach in the field of health.
Every work related to health sector in the country where the entire department and ministry had the responsibility of just health ministry earlier, be it Ministry of Sanitation, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, Ministry of Consumer Affairs or Ministry of Women and Child Development or be it Ministry of Women and Child Development or be it the State Governments or be it the Ministry of Health or be it the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
Preventive health care is also the cheapest and the easiest.
And the more we will be aware of the progressive healthcare, the more the person, the family and the society will also benefit.
The first need for life to be healthy is cleanliness .
In the form of Proventive Health Care, Yoga has renewed its identity worldwide.
Yoga guarantees both fitness and wellness
This is the result of our commitment that Yoga has become a mass movement today and has reached every household.
This time International Day of Yoga is 21st June - there are less than 100 days left .
On the last three International Yoga Days, everywhere in the country and the world, people participated in it with great enthusiasm.
This time too, we have to ensure that we do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends, all of us for Yoga from now on.
My dear countrymen, I am not a Yoga Teacher.
I will share this video with you all so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Efforts are being made at a comprehensive level for health care accessible and affordable , cheap and accessible for the common man .
Today more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country where more than 800 medicines are being provided at a low cost.
More new centres are being opened
I appeal to the listeners of Mann Ki Baat to provide information to the needy about these Jan Aushadhi Kendras - the cost of many medicines will be reduced.
They ' ll have a great service .
The cost of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85
Under Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in existing 479 medical colleges in the country has been increased to about 68 thousand
A new medical college will be opened between every 3 districts
The goal of making the country TB free by 2025
It ' s a big job
You need your help in bringing awareness to the masses
To get rid of TB, we all have to make collective efforts.
My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
Industry was an effective medium for them in which employment could be provided to the poorest of the poor.
Today, India has emerged as a broad spot in the global economy and today the highest Foreign Direct India in the world.
The whole world is looking at India as BC for Investment Innovation and Development
This was the idea that the development of industries would be possible in the cities, which led to Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar relied on the urbanization and urbanization of India.
Today, the Smart Cities Mission and Urban Mission was launched in the country with this vision to provide all kinds of facilities in the big cities and small towns of the country, be it good roads, water facilities, health facilities, education or digital connectivity.
Baba Saheb had strong faith in self-reliance, self-reliance.
They did not want a man to live his life in poverty .
At the same time, he also believed that the poverty cannot be overcome by just giving something to the poor.
India, Stand up India initiatives are giving birth to our young innovators, young entrepreneurs.
In the 1930s and 1940s when there was talk of roads and railways only in India, Babasaheb Ambedkar had spoken about ports and waterways.
These were Dr. Baba Saheb who saw Jal Shakti as a nation-power
Today, historic efforts are being made for waterways and ports in the country.
New ports are being built on different sea shores of India and infrastructure is being strengthened at old ports.
During the 40s, more discussions were done about 2nd World War, Emerging World War and Division - Dr. Ambedkar in a way.
The foundation of India's spirit was laid
He spoke of the importance of federalism, federalism and stressed on working together with the Centre and the States for the upliftment of the country.
Today, we have adopted the mantra of cooperative federalism, cooperative federalism and competitive cooperative federalism in every aspect of governance and the most important thing is that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people associated with backward classes like me.
He has shown us that in order to move forward, it is not necessary that people born in a large or a rich family but also those born in poor families in India can see their dreams, try to fulfill those dreams and achieve success.
Yes, it happened when many people ridiculed Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
India, which belongs to Ambedkar, belongs to the poor and to the backward.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organized from 14th April to 5th May on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar
Under this, there will be different programmes on rural development, poor welfare and social justice across India.
I urge all of you to take part in this campaign.
My dear countrymen, many festivals will come in the next few days, Lord Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter, Vaisakhi
The day of the birth anniversary of Lord Mahavir is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance
The life of Lord Mahavir ji, the messenger of non-violence will inspire all of us.
Best wishes to all the countrymen on Mahavir Jayanti
As soon as the discussion of the Easter comes, Lord Christ remembers the inspirational teachings of Christ who have always given humanity the message of peace, goodwill, justice, mercy and compassion .
In April, the festival of Vaisakhi will be celebrated in Punjab and West India, in the same days, in Bihar, the joy and joy of Poila Vaisak in Assam will be shadowed .
All these festivals are connected to our fields and foodgrains in some form, through these festivals, we thank nature for the precious gifts received in the form of yield.
Once again wish all the festivals coming to you
In the beginning of today, Mann Ki Baat begins with a phone call.
We have seen that the color of the sea looks blue but we know from the experiences of our daily life that there is no color of water .
Have we ever thought that the river, the sea, the water becomes colourful
This question came in the mind of a young man in the 1920s .
This question gave birth to a great scientist of modern India
When we talk about science, the first name of India-Ratna Sir C.V. Raman comes in front of us
One of his treasures is famous by the name of Raman Effect
We celebrate National Science Day on 28th February every year because it is said that on this day he had planned a light scattering incident for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science
On the one hand there has been a tradition of great mathematician Bodhayan, Bhaskar, Brahmagupta and Aryabhatta and on the other hand Sushrut and Charak are our pride in the field of medicine .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana to Satyendra Nath Bose are the pride of India.
In the name of Satyendra Nath Bose, the name of Damous Particle Boson was also named
It was very interesting to know about the miracles in the field of science.
Nowadays machines make their own intelligence more smart with self learning
Can any help the farmers about the crop yield
In the past, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I had the opportunity to visit Gujarat for the inauguration of ICDRETE in Ahmedabad.
Science and Technology are value neutral
They don't have values, themselves.
Any machine will do the same as we want
But, it depends on us what we want to do with the machine
Thomas Alva Dison, who invented the High Bulb, failed many times in his experiments
Once asked about this, he replied, I have discovered ten thousand ways of not building a High Bulb, i.e. Dison also made his failures his power.
Incidentally, I am fortunate to be in Auroville, the workplace of Maharshi Arabindo today.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British rule, fought against them, questioned their rule.
Similarly, as a great sage, he questioned every aspect of life.
Find answers and show the path to humanity
Repeated asking questions to know the truth, it is important
This is the real inspiration behind the scientific treasure .
You should not sit comfortably until you get answers to questions like why, what and how
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, At the time of Crisis, several messages are coming to me on these topics. People keep writing something or the other.
From Pune, Shri Rabindra Singh has spoken on Cooperational Safety at his Conference on the Narendra Modi Mobile App
He has written that safety standards on factories and construction sites are not so good in our country.
On the next 4th of March, India is the National Safety Day, then the Prime Minister should talk about Safety in his Mann Ki Baat programme so that awareness among the people about Safety increases.
If we are not aware of the safety in daily life and are unable to achieve it then it becomes difficult to get it during the disaster.
We all read the boards written on the roads many times, it says that the vigilance has been reduced, the loss of a mistake, the smile and the smile - do not leave the world so quickly, do not join the world with security - do not do any fun, otherwise it will be cheaper than that, those sentences have no use in our lives.
If we be cautious, follow the necessary rules, we can protect our lives, but we can also save society from very big accidents.
Sometimes we have seen that a lot of formulas have been written about the safety on the workplace but whenever we see it, it does not see anywhere.
As far as disasters are concerned, India is a country full of diversity in terms of geographical and climate.
This country has suffered many practical and man-made disasters such as chemical and industrial accidents
Disaster Friendship initiative has also been taken for training of volunteers in the districts which are in danger of flood, cyclone.
Training and awareness plays a very important role
Two-three years ago, thousands of people lost their lives every year from Luheat Wave.
After this, NMA organised workshops for the management of Heat Wave, launched a campaign to create awareness among the people.
A good result came out of everyone's participation
In 2017, the number of deaths due to Lu declined unexpectedly to around 220
This shows that if we give priority to security, we can get security
I would like to appreciate all those who work in such a way in the society, be social organisations, be aware citizens, who are involved in relief and rescue work within minutes wherever there is disaster.
And the number of such anonymous heroes is no less
We have to become a risk conscious society
In our culture, we often talk about the preservation of values, safety of values, but we also have to understand the values of security.
We have to make it a part of our life .
I mean , what was the arrangement to give information
Why
Because we are not conscientious in nature and therefore we hear our ears after the airplanes sit but this information is for me. No one of us feels like this.
We have the same experience in every field of life .
We should not imagine that the safety is for anyone else, if we all become aware of our safety then the feeling of security of the society is also inherent.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, emphasis was laid on making waste to health and waste to energy through biogas for villages under Swachh Bharat.
Initiative for this was initiated and named GBAR-Chan-Galvaniing Organic Bio-Agro Resources
The objective of this GBAR-Chan scheme is to make villages clean and convert solid waste of animals and dung and fields into MPST and BI-GAS, to generate money and energy.
Some European countries and China use dung and other biological wastes of animals to produce energy but its full potential was not being used in India .
We are moving forward in this direction under Swachh Bharat Mission Rural
The goal of using cattle dung, waste from agriculture, waste from kitchen, all of them to make biogas-based energy has been set.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, farmers, sisters and brothers in rural India will be encouraged to see dung and waste not only as waste but as a source of income.
Gobar Dhan Yojana will benefit rural areas to help keep the village clean
Animal health will be better and productivity will increase
Biogas will increase self-sufficiency in energy for cooking and lighting
Farmers and Animal Husbandry will help in increasing income
New job opportunities will be available for waste collection, transportation, sale of biogas etc.
A online trading platform will also be created for the smooth system of Gobar Dhan Yojana which will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially my sisters living in rural India to come forward and take full advantage of this opportunity by making a Self Help Group and making cooperative societies.
I invite you to become participants of this movement of clean energy and green jobs, take initiatives in making waste healthy in your villages and making cow dung-food from dung.
My dear countrymen, till date we have been listening to music festivals, food festivals and film festivals.
But the first waste festival of the state was organised while making a unique effort in Raipur in Chhattisgarh .
The objective behind this festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was to create awareness about the creative use of the waste of the city and to create awareness about various ways of reuse the carbag.
During this festival, various activities took place, from students to elders, everyone was involved.
Different types of artworks were made using waste .
Workshops organized to educate people on all aspects of Waste Management
Inspired by Raipur , different types of waste festivals were also held in other districts .
Everyone initiated innovative ideas, shared, discussed and poems were read.
A festive atmosphere of cleanliness was prepared
Especially the way schoolchildren participated, it was amazing.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and administration of the entire Chhattisgarh for the innovative manner in which the importance of waste management and sanitation was displayed in this festival.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on March 8
There are many programs in the country and the world .
The Nari Shakti Puraskar in the country is also honoured by women who have done exemplary work in different areas in the past .
On this occasion I remember Swami Vivekananda's promise
He had said the idea of perfect womenhood is perfect independence - this idea of Swamiji, a hundred years ago, expresses the thought of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life, it is our responsibility.
We are a part of the tradition where men were identified by women, Yashoda-Nandan, Kaushalya-Nandan, Gandhari-son, this was the identity of a son.
They have not only carried forward Allah, but have also worked to pursue the country and the society and take it to a new level .
In the past , I had a very good suggestion by a gentleman .
He had suggested that on March 8, there are programmes like celebration of Women's Day, are those who have completed 100 years in every village and city
Can a programme of respect for such mothers and sisters be organised and a long life can be spoken in it
Under this campaign launched from 26th January 2018, these women have set a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets in just 20 days.
It includes about 1 lakh Sakhi Mandals, 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water bodies, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women Raj Mistry
You can imagine how big event is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that Nari Shakti is a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will be able to transform the cleanliness campaign in the normal life and the sanitation rites into the nature of the people effectively.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching in the news that electricity has reached the three villages of Elephanta Island after 70 years of independence and how much joy and enthusiasm the people there are about it.
You all know very well, Elephanta Island is ten kilometers away from the sea from Mumbai.
I was surprised to know that despite being near Mumbai and being such a big center of tourism, there was no electricity in Elephanta for so many years of independence.
For 70 years, three villages of Elephanta Island Rajbandar, Morbandar and Sentbandar, the dark shadow in the lives of the people there, are now dark and sixth and their life has been illuminated.
I congratulate the administration and the people there .
I am glad that Elephanta ' s villages and Elephanta ' s caves will be illuminated by electricity .
This is not just a power, but a new beginning of development.
The lives of the countrymen should be illuminated and happy in their lives. What can be the moment of satisfaction and happiness
My dear brothers and sisters, We have just celebrated the festival of Shivratri.
Now the month of March, the fields decorated with floating crops, the golden balloons of wheat and the beauty of the mango that blooms the mind - this is the specialty of this month .
But this month is the most dearest of all of us for the festival of Holi .
On March 2, the whole country will celebrate Holi festival with joy
The importance of the colors in Holi is the same as the Holika combustion because this day is the day of burning evils in the fire and destroying them .
Holi is a good opportunity to be a participant in each others happiness and love gives a message of unity and brotherhood.
My best wishes and best wishes to all the countrymen on the festival of Holi.
This festival is filled with colorful happiness in the lives of our countrymen - this is the best wishes
My dear countrymen, Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, today Shri Prakash Tripathi has written a long letter on the Narendra ModiApp and has urged me to touch the subjects written in his letter.
He has written, Kalpana Chawla, who is going to the space on February 1, is the virtue date.
He left us in the Columbia space crash but inspired millions of youth around the world.
I am grateful to Bhai Prakash ji that he has started from the farewell of Kalpana Chawla in his long letter
It is a matter of sadness for everyone that we lost Kalpana Chawla ji at such a young age but he gave a message to thousands of girls from all over the world, especially in India that there is no limit for women and power.
There is nothing impossible if there is desire and determination, there is a tongue of doing something.
It is very happy to see that women in India are moving fast in every field and enhancing the pride of the country.
Since ancient times, the respect of women in our country, their place in society and their contribution has been surprised by the whole world.
There is a long tradition of Indian scholars .
Several enemies of India have been contributing to the fabrication of the Vedas
Lopamudra, Gargi, Maitreya do not know how many names are
It reflects the importance of women in our society
And then, in our society, women have been given the status of power
This woman power binds the entire country, the entire society, the family and the unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathi has given many further examples
He has written that our brave Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's fighter aircraft Sukhoi 30 will inspire him to fly, inspire him.
Three brave women emotional Kanth, Mohana Singh and Avani Chaturvedi are made Pilots and are training in Sukhoi-30
All Women Rue, led by Capacity Vajpayee, from Delhi to San Francisco of America and Air India to Delhi.
Flighted in India Boeing Jet - and all women of all
In the past, Honble President has taken a new initiative
The President met a group of extraordinary women who have done something first in their respective fields.
These women achievers of the country, first email merchant Navy apptain, first lady train driver of passenger train, first lady Fire Dighter, first lady bus driver, first lady reaching Antarctica, first lady to reach Everest in this way, first lady to reach Everest in every field, first lady ladies - our women and powers have achieved extraordinary achievements by breaking the conservation of the society.
He showed that through hard work, passion and determination, a new path can be created by crossing all obstacles and obstacles.
A book on these women achievers, first classes has also been prepared so that the whole country can take inspiration from these women powers, their lives and their works.
It is also available as e-book on the Narendra Modi website.
Today, the country's women-power plays an important role in positive changes in the country and the society.
Today, when we are discussing women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment, you must be thinking what is connectivity in the middle
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India where there are all women employees .
Whether it is women's status in all departments - be it commercial department, railway police, ticket checking, announcing, point persons, more than 40 women have their status.
This time many people wrote on Twitter and on the other social medicine after watching the Republic Day parade that the parade was one of the main points, the BSC Biker Contingent in which all women were participating.
He was doing bold experiments and these scenes were also surprised by the guests coming from abroad.
Empowerment is a form of self-reliance
Today our women-power is leading
Being self-reliant
When the mention of tribal women comes, a definite picture emerges in everyone's mind, in which there are forests, footpaths, women carrying the burden of wood on their heads.
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh, our women-power has made a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, which is a Maoist-affected area
Violence, torture, bomb, gun, pistol - Maoists have created a terrible atmosphere of this.
Tribal women in such dangerous areas are becoming self-reliant by running Rickshaw
In a very short period many women have joined it .
I also appreciate the district administration, from providing grants to training, the district administration has played an important role in the success of these women.
Leave the external period, accept the improvement of what is necessary
Any life society is identified by its Self-orrecting Mechanism
For centuries against social evils and evils , our country has been consistently striving at the individual and social level .
Just a few days ago Bihar took an interesting initiative
In order to eradicate social evils in the state, the world's longest human chain of more than 13 thousand kilometers, human chain was created
Through this campaign, people were made aware against evils like child marriage and dowry practices.
The whole state resolved to fight with evils like dowry and child marriage
Children, elderly, enthusiastic youth, mothers and sisters, everyone was involved in this war.
The human chain, which started from Patna's historic Gandhi Maidan, went unbreakable to the borders of the state.
It is necessary for all the people of the society to get the benefit of development in the true sense that our society is free from these evils .
Let us all together take a pledge to eliminate such evils from the society and a new India.
Build India, a strong and capable India
I appreciate the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of Bihar, the administration there and every person involved in the human chain that they have taken such a special and comprehensive initiative towards social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Darshan of MyGov, Mysore, Karnataka has written on MyGov that the cost of medicines was Rs. 6,000 a month for the treatment of his father.
He did not know about the first Pradhan Mantri Janaushadhi Yojana
But now when they got information about the Janaushadhi Kendra and they bought medicines from there, their cost of medicines decreased by 75 percent.
He has expressed his desire that I should talk about it in the Mann Ki Baat programme so that more and more people can know about it and take advantage of it .
For the past few years, many people used to write me about this.
Get a deep satisfaction
And I also liked that the idea of Lord Darshan ji had come to him that he had got it to others as well.
The objective behind this scheme is to make health care more affordable and encourage ease of living
Pharmaceuticals available at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are approximately 50 to 90 cheaper than branded medicines sold in the market.
This helps the general public, especially the senior citizens who take medicines everyday and saves a lot.
Generic medicines to be purchased in this are according to the standard of the World Health Organization .
That ' s why good quality medicines are available at cheap prices .
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
This not only provides affordable medicines but also creates new employment opportunities for Indian entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at the nectar stores of Prime Minister Indian Janaushadhi Kendras and Hospitals
The only objective behind all these is to provide quality and affordable health services to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Mangesh from Maharashtra shared a photo on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Photo was such that my attention was drawn to that photo.
The photo was in which a granddaughter was participating in the clean Morna River Cleanliness Campaign with his grandfather.
I came to know that the citizens of Akola had organised Swachhta Abhiyan to clean the Morana river under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
Morana river used to flow for the first twelve months but now it has become seasonal
The second pain is that the river was completely filled with wild grass, Jalkumbh
A lot of waste was being thrown on the river and its edge .
A action plan was prepared and one day before Makar Sankranti on 13th January, the two edges of the Morana River were cleaned at 14 locations in the area of four kilometers under the first phase of Mission Lean Mora.
More than six thousand citizens of Akola, more than 100 NGOs, colleges, students, children, elderly, mothers and sisters participated in this good work of Mission Lean Morna.
The Swachhta Abhiyan was continued in the same way on 20th January 2018 and I am told that till the Morana river is completely clean, this campaign will run on every Saturday morning.
It shows that if a person decides to do something , nothing is impossible .
Large changes can be brought through mass movement.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the administration of the district and the city corporation for making this work a peoples movement and your efforts will inspire other people of the country.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot of discussions about the Padma Awards.
In this regard, even in the newspapers, attention is also attracted to T.
Every year there has been a tradition of awarding Padmas but in the last three years its entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can nominate anyone
Transparency has come because the entire process is online
In a way, the selection process of these awards has become complete transformation.
Padma Awards have been given to such people who are not usually seen in big cities, in newspapers, in TV, at the function.
Now there is no identity of the person to give the award, the importance of his work is increasing.
You must have heard Shri Aurobindo Gupta ji, you will be happy to know that I am happy to know.
Arvind ji, a student of IIT Kanpur, spent his life in making toys for children
They have been making toys from waste for four decades so that children can increase the curiosity of science .
They are trying to motivate children from useless things to scientific experiments, so they are inspiring children by visiting three thousand schools across the country and showing films made in 18 languages.
How wonderful life, how wonderful dedication
Sitava Jodhti (SI) of Karnataka, a similar story
They have not been called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades , he has contributed greatly in changing the lives of countless women in Belagavi ( BAGAI ) .
He had dedicated himself as Devdasi at the age of seven, but then laid his life for the welfare of the goddesses .
Not only this, they have also done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You must have heard the name about Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh, Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a very poor family, tribal family.
He used to do a normal job for living but he was fond of making traditional tribal paintings .
Today, due to this hobby, they have respect not only in India but in the whole world.
The talent of Bhajju Shyam ji who illuminated the name of India abroad was recognized and he was awarded the Padma Shri award .
Listening to the story of the tribal woman Lakshmikutty of Kerala, you will be filled with pleasant surprise
Lakshmikutty is a teacher in Kallar and still lives in a hut made of palm leaves in the tribal area between dense forests.
He has created five hundred herbal medicines on the basis of his memory
They have the power to make medicines used after snake bites .
Lakshmiji is constantly serving the society with his knowledge of herbal medicines
He was honored with Padma Shri for his contribution to society by identifying this anonymous person .
I would like to mention another name today . The 75-year-old Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal was also chosen for the award .
Subhasini Mistry is a woman who sold utensils, vegetables in other houses to make a hospital
When he was 23, his husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident motivated him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are treated free of cost in their hospital built with hard work.
I am confident that there are many males and gems in our Bahuratna-Vasundhara, many women and gems that no one knows or knows.
The Padma Award is a medium, but I will also tell the countrymen that those living around us, those living for the society, those who eat for the society, those who do something or the other speciality and those who work for the entire life are hundreds of people who should sometimes bring them into the middle of the society.
They do not work for dignity but because of their work we get inspiration .
Sometimes in schools, colleges, such people should call and listen to their experiences.
Beyond the award, there should be some efforts in society too.
My dear countrymen, every year on 9th January we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
This is January 9, when the venerated Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from ST ARIA
On this day, we celebrate the unbreakable bond between India and Indians living around the world.
This year, on Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, we had organized a programme where all MPs and mayors from Indian origin living around the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that in that programme, from Malaysia, New ealand, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Diji, Tannia, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa and America, and from many other countries where our mayor is original - Indian, where MPs are original - Indian, all of them participated.
I am happy that the people of Indian origin living in different countries are serving those countries as well as maintaining their strong relations with India. This time the European Union, the European Union has sent me a calendar in which they have shown their contributions in different fields by Indians living in different countries of Europe.
Someone is dedicated to Ayurveda, somebody brings the mind of the society with his music and somebody from his poems.
Someone is researching the climate change and someone is working on Indian texts and someone has set up a truck and someone has built a mosque.
I would like to thank the European Union for this remarkable work, for recognising the people of Indian origin and for giving information to the people around the world through them.
On January 30 is the death anniversary of revered Bapu, who has shown us a new path.
On that day we celebrate martyrdom day we pay homage to the great martyrs who lost their lives in the defense of the country at 11 o'clock.
The path of peace and non-violence, this is the path of Bapu
Whether it is India or the world, whether it is a person or a family or a society or a revered Bapu, the ideals that Bapu has given us are still very relevant.
They were not just theory
Currently, we see how correct Bapu's things were
If we pledge to follow the path of Bapu - let's go, let's go - then what can be a big tribute than that
My dear countrymen, I conclude my speech by conveying my best wishes to all of you for 2018.
Where the youth of 18 to 25 years of age should churn on New India, find ways and plans
How will we prove our resolutions before 2022
How can we build an India which our freedom fighters dreamt of
B.
A.
I spoke to them, there was no name of disappointment, there was no enthusiasm, zeal, energy, dreams, I had a resolution and I got inspiration from those daughters and these are the strengths of the country. These are the future of my country, my dear countrymen, not only of our country, whenever there is talk of the famous religious places of the world, it is very natural to talk about the Sabarimala temple of Kerala, in this world famous temple, every year millions of devotees come here to seek the blessings of Lord Ayyyappa Swami.
And especially at that place which is located between the hills and the forests, how can this problem be converted into rituals, how to find out the way to overcome the problem and what is so powerful in public participation - this Sabarimala temple is an example in itself.
Who will have made such rules
Hardly, there will be a citizen of India who does not respect and respect them.
At that age, we are very bigger than all of us and at different stages of the country, they are witnesses.
He's going to be 90 years old on 28th September.
Before leaving abroad, I had the privilege of talking to Didi on the phone.
These conversations were the same as in a very bad way, the younger brother speaks to his elder sister.
Modi ji: Lata Didi, salute
I am speaking Narendra Modi
Modi ji: So before I was thought, Hilata ji: Yes Hamodi ji: I congratulate you on your birthday, congratulations beforehand.
Lata ji: There are many people above the age, but getting the blessings of the bigger than their work is a big thing.
Lata ji: Yes, I think that the blessings of my parents, and the blessings of those who listen
I'm nothing
Modi ji: This is what your humility is, this is a great education for all of us and it is an inspiration for us that you have always given priority to the rites and humility of your parents even after doing so much in your life.
Lata ji:
Modi ji: And whenever I come to you ji: Ji Modi ji: You fed me something or the other Gujarati
Lata ji: Yes, you don't know what you are.
I know that the picture of India is changing by your arrival and that is what I am very happy.
It looks very good
Modi ji: Just sister, continue your blessings, continue your blessings on the whole country and, people like us should do something or the other, you have always inspired me.
Your letter also keeps getting me and I also get some of your gifts. I have a special joy of this personality, which is a family relationship.
Lata ji: yes, yes
No, I don't want to give you a lot of trouble, because, I'm looking, I know, how much business you are and how much work you do
What do you have to think
When you came to the feet of your mother, I also sent somebody to him and blessed him.
Modi ji: Yes
My mother remembered and she was telling me
Lata ji: And he blessed me on the telephone, so I liked Modi ji: Our mother was very happy, because of your love.
And once again I extend my best wishes to you on birthday.
Modi ji: This time when Mumbai came, I would like to come to Rubaru ji: yes, yes, yes
Lata ji: Yes, necessity, necessity
This is my destiny .
Modi ji: Salute, Didi
Lata ji: Salute
Modi ji: My best wishes to Tulta ji: Very much salute
Modi ji: Pranam ji
Further, for several weeks, all over the country, there will be a shout of festivals.
My best wishes to all of you, the coming festivals.
In the festivals, all the family members will come together
Perhaps, these sayings are not just words, we have an order, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Think, on the one hand, some houses shine with light, on the other hand, in front of it, in the houses of some people around it, there is dark shadow.
In some houses, sweets are getting worse, so in some houses, children like sweets.
The real joy of these festivals is only when this darkness is sixth, it is less dark - it spreads .
We share happiness there too, where there is no shortage, and this is our nature too.
In our homes, sweets, clothing, gits, when delivery is in, think about a moment, delivery out.
At least what is in our homes, which we don't take into account now, don't require delivery out of these things.
In many cities, many NGOs start-ups of young friends do this work.
They collect everything from the houses of the people, clothes, sweets, food, finding the needy and bringing them to them and act as anonymous.
Can this time, in this season of festivals, with full awareness and determination, eradicate the darkness under this lamp
The smile on the faces of many poor families, on festivals, your happiness will double, your face will be shiny, you will be given, you will be bright, you will be bright and bright.
My dear brothers and sisters, Lakshmi comes home as a fortune and prosperity in Deepawali.
In our culture, daughters have been considered Lakshmi because daughter brings fortune and prosperity.
Can we do this program of honoring this Laxmi of India on Diwali
There will be many daughters, many daughters around us, who will be doing extraordinary work.
Someone will be working for the teaching of poor children, someone will be involved in spreading awareness about cleanliness and health, then someone will be serving the society by becoming a doctor, engineer.
Being a lawyer, trying to get justice to someone
May our society identify, respect and pride our daughters.
Programmes of their respect, all over the country
One more work can be done to share more and more in the social media about the achievements of these daughters, and use Bharatkilami (Lakshmi of India)
As we all launched a great campaign together, Selie with Daughter and it spread all over the world.
Similarly, this time, we should run the campaign, Laxmi of India
Incentive of India's Lakshmi means strengthening the path of prosperity of the country and the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, I had already said about Mann Ki Baat that I get the privilege of interacting with many well-known people.
In the past, a student from far-flung Arunachal, Alina Tayang, sent me a big interesting letter
And it says, I read the letter in front of you. Honourable Prime Minister, my name is Alina Tayang
I'm from Roing, Arunachal Pradesh
This time when my exam results came, some people asked me what did you read the Cam Warriors Book
I told, that, I have not read this book.
But, go back, I bought this book and read it 2-3 times
After this my experience was very good
I thought that if I had read this book before Ceam, I would have had a lot of benefit.
I liked a lot of aspects from this book, but I also saw that there are many mantras for students but there is nothing more in this book for parents and teachers.
My little student friend, first, thank you for writing a letter.
Yam Warriors 2-3 times, thank you
What you have said is that if I get out at the time of the new edition, I will definitely try to write some things for the participants and the teachers.
I urge all the students, teachers and participants of the country to tell me your experiences and suggestions about aspects related to stress freezing.
I must study him
I will think of it and I will try to write it in my own words and in my own way, and it may be that if your suggestions come more, my new edition will also be confirmed.
So I ' ll wait for your ideas
Once again I express my gratitude to our little friend of Arunachal, student Alina Tayang.
My dear countrymen, you also know about the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country through newspapers and through TV.
But, you don't know whether I'm a common man like you
If someone else had been on this occasion, he would have been depressed and disappointed, but, his face did not die, but he brought a smile on the faces of everyone with his words.
Everyone was convinced that the form of sportsman spirit was seen in their humility, simplicity and simplicity in the true sense.
The audience here warmly welcomed his words
Even after the defeat in a tough collision, he praised his rival Nadal and gave a living proof of sportsman spirit.
On the other hand, however, Champion Nadal also lauded the game of Daniel.
The zeal of the loser in the same match and the humility of the winner were both worth seeing .
The thinking of our ancestors is indeed worthy .
Mani Kanchan coincidence: Janati Loksya Lochan Anandamayani, when a person contains qualification and humility together, then who can not win his heart again
In fact, this young player has won the hearts of people around the world.
My dear countrymen and especially my young friends, what I am going to talk about, I am doing for your good.
It ' s very difficult to stop it later .
But, if we start awake and stop it, a lot can be saved.
With this feeling, I feel like, today, especially with my youth, I must do something.
We all know that tobacco addiction is very harmful for health and it becomes very difficult to quit its addiction.
Tobacco consumers increase the risk of diseases like cancer, diabetes, blood pressure.
Everyone says so .
Tobacco addiction is caused by nicotine present in it .
Its consumption in adolescence also affects the development of the brain .
But, today, I want to talk to you on a new topic.
You will be aware that recently, e-cigarette has been banned in India.
The e-cigarette is a kind of electronic device different from the normal cigarette.
While we all understand the dangers of common science, a wrong concept of e-cigarette has been created.
It has been spread that there is no threat from e-cigarette
They don't smoke, don't smoke, don't smoke.
They know that smoking, tobacco causes huge loss to the body.
The drinker knows and the seeer knows .
But the e-cigarette case is very different.
There is no such awareness among the people about e-cigarette.
They are completely unaware of its danger and because of this reason sometimes e-cigarette enters home in Kauthuhal quietly.
Our youth and wealth walk on the path of waste, unknowingly goes on.
In fact, many harmful chemicals are mixed in e-cigarette, which has a bad effect on health.
You know, when someone smokes around us, we know it from the smell.
In such a situation, many adolescents and youngsters are seen roaming around in their books, in their offices, in their pockets, sometimes in their hands and sometimes they become victims of it.
The younger generation is the future of the country
The e-cigarette has been banned so that this new way of drug addiction does not destroy our young country.
Children's lives do not ruin the dreams of every family
These diseases, these habits do not root in society
I urge all of you to quit tobacco addiction and not misunderstanding about e-cigarette.
Let us all together build a healthy India
You can get it
Remember India , huh
India means that if we go to gym for two-two hours in the morning and evening then it will happen.
This is our mother India, this is our country, Bahuratna Vasundhara
Many human gems have come out of this earth .
India-Year has been the birthplace of such extraordinary people and has been a land of work.
And these are those people who have eaten themselves, not for themselves, for others.
Similarly, a great Vibhuti is being honored at Vatican City on October 13.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that Pope Francis will declare Mary Thresia a saint on October 13 coming
The work done by Sister Mary Thresia for the betterment of humanity in his little lifetime of 50 years is an example for the whole world.
He had a wonderful attachment to social service and education.
He built many schools, hostels and orphanages, and remained in this mission forever.
Once again I pay homage to Sister Mary Thresia and congratulate the people of India, especially our Christian brothers and sisters for this achievement.
My dear countrymen, not only India, it is a matter of pride for the entire world today that when we are celebrating Gandhi 150, 130 crore Indians have resolved to be free from Collection See Plastic.
In the direction of environmental conservation, the kind of leadership that India has taken around the world, today the eyes of all countries are towards India.
I am confident that all of you will be a part of the campaign to liberate from Colle Se Plastic on 2nd October.
People are contributing to this campaign in their respective ways .
However, a young man from our own country has launched a very unique campaign.
I noticed their work, so I talked to them on the phone and tried to understand their new experiment.
Maybe these things can be used to the country and the people of the country.
Mr. Ripudaman Belvi ji is making a unique effort.
When I heard the word plogging for the first time , it was also new for me .
Overseas , perhaps these words have been used in some quantity .
However, in India, Riputman Belvi ji has spread it very much.
Let ' s talk to them .
I congratulate you all and my friends, this time on the occasion of the birth anniversary of revered Bapu, the Ministry of Sports is also on this occasion.
2 km plogging on October 2, these programmes are going to be held across the country.
How to do this programme, what happens in the programme, we have heard from the experience of Riputman ji.
With this We will not only take care of our health , but will also protect the health of the mother of the earth .
With this campaign, awareness is increasing among the people about itness as well as cleanliness.
I am confident that if 130 crore Indians take one step in this direction, then India will move 130 crore steps in the direction of getting rid of single use plastic.
Riputman ji, once again, thank you very much
And I congratulate you, your team and for this new imagination.
We want to move forward to transform your life into a countrywide
One thing you want to remember in advance
Well, I will say it in detail in the next Mann Ki Baat but today I am saying in a little advance so that you get the opportunity to prepare.
You remember, October 31 is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
So you start preparing from now on
I would like to talk in detail but it's time, some people can start practices and some plans.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I had told the Red Fort that by 2022 you should visit 15 places in India.
At least 15 places and even if that happens, make a night, two night stay program
You see Hindustan, understand, experience
How many diversity do we have
And when they come to the festival of Diwali on holidays, people are required and therefore I will urge you to visit any 15 places in India.
Today our rank is twenty-four and five years ago our rank was at 65th, that is, in a way we have put a very big jump.
If we try more, we will make our place in the world's major places in tourism after 75 years of independence.
See also, that in the days of Diwali, there is no arson anywhere in the firecrackers, etc.
Whatever precautions should be taken for this, you must be cautioned.
Let's go
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat , November 2017
Can you imagine how hard they might have worked to build the Constitution of our country full of diversity
The Konkan coastal area, where the sea has an important role, came under the state of Shivaji Maharaj, many forts related to Shivaji Maharaj like Indus Fort, Murud Janjira, Golden Fort etc. were either located on the sea shores or were surrounded by the sea, the responsibility of the security of these forts was the Maratha naval force. In Maratha Navy, there was a combination of big ships and small ships, their naval personnel were very efficient in attacking and protecting any enemy and we should discuss Maratha Navy and not remember Kanhoji Angre, how could it be
Thinking too, it feels afraid that there will be no soil, no trees and plants will grow, where will human life be possible
Where will it be possible
It has been proved from all kinds of scientific methods that the earth and the mother suffer from serious losses due to the use of urea more than required, the farmer is the son of the earth, how can the farmer see the earth and the mother ill
Can our farmers, the sons of our earth, the children of our earth make this pledge to awaken the relationship of this mother-son once again that the amount of urea he uses in his farm today, 2022, when 75 years of independence will stop the use of half
The person of North-India will not know what is in South India
The person of West-India will not know what is in East India
When our country is full of varied diversity, Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji, when he visited India, he got a new inspiration to see India and to live for him, all these great men made an effort to know and understand India in the beginning of their work. Have we tried to live in India in ourselves, to different states of our country, to different communities, groups, their traditions, their cultivation, their catering, their catering and their beliefs as a student
Can you place on Incredible India (Hash Tag Incredible India)
If you see, all the people of one state will tell this thing then I will say in the government that they should scrutinize it and what seven things the Common has come from every state, they should prepare publicity and help in promoting tourist destination in a way.
My dear countrymen, Sadar Namaskar
On one hand the country is immersed in festivals and on the other hand when news of violence comes from any corner of India then it is natural to worry about the country .
This is our country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel who lives for the unity of the country.
For centuries, our ancestors have accepted public life values, non-violence, Samadar and are filled with our tongues.
Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: They have been listening from childhood, say
I want to convince the countrymen, those who take the law, those who suppress the path of violence, whether it is a person or a group, these countries will never tolerate nor any government will tolerate.
My dear countrymen, our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not confined to food, lifestyle and clothing.
We see diversity in every behaviour of life .
Even our festivals are full of diversity and thousands of years old with our cultural heritage, see cultural traditions, see social traditions, see historical events, there will be hardly any day left in 365 days when we do not have any festivals.
Now you must have seen that all our festivals walk according to the journal at the time of nature
There is a direct relationship with nature .
Many of our festivals are directly connected to the farmers and are connected to the fishermen.
Today I am talking about festivals , so first of all I would like to say to you lucky dumb .
Festival of Sanvatsari celebrated yesterday in Jain society
Paryushan festival is celebrated in the month of Bhadra in Jain society .
The last day of the Paryushana festival is the day of Sanvatsari .
This is a wonderful tradition in itself .
The festival of Sanvatsari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship
It is also called forgiveness festival in a way and on this day there is a tradition of calling each other Michchami Dukkadam .
Anyway in our scriptures is forgiveness , Veerasya Bhushanam i . e . Bhushan of forgiveness .
Forgiveness is heroic .
We have heard these discussions and Mahatma Gandhi always used to say that forgiveness is the specialty of a powerful person .
Shakespeare, while describing the importance of forgiveness in his drama The Merchant of Energy, wrote that Mercy is two-blest, It blesseth him that gives and him that is forgiveness and whoever is forgiven, both receive the blessings of God.
My dear countrymen, these days in every corner of India, Ganesh Chaturthi has grown up and when it comes to Ganesh Chaturthi, it is natural to talk about public Ganesh festivals.
Balgangadhar Lokmanya Tilak gave birth to this tradition 125 years ago and before the last 125 years of independence he became a symbol of the freedom movement .
And after independence, they have become a symbol of social education, social consciousness.
The festival of Ganesh Chaturthi lasts for 10 days
This great festival is called a symbol of unity, equality and purity .
My best wishes to all the countrymen on Ganeshotsav
Now the festival of Onam is being celebrated in Kerala
One of the colorful festivals of India is the main festival of Onam Kerala .
This festival is known for its social and cultural importance .
The festival of Onam showcases the rich cultural heritage of Kerala
This festival awakens the message of love and harmony in society as well as a new zeal, new hope and new faith in the minds of the people.
And now these festivals are also becoming the cause of attraction of tourism.
And I will tell the countrymen that like the festival of Navratri in Gujarat or Durga Festival in Bengal has become an attraction of tourism in a way .
Our festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
What can we do in that direction, we should think
A few days later in the series of these festivals, the festival of Eid-ul-uha will also be celebrated across the country.
My best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Eid-ul-uha.
Festivals are symbols of faith and faith for us, we have to make festivals a symbol of cleanliness in New India.
Festivals and sanitation are associated with family life .
Preparation of festival means cleanliness
This is not a new thing for us but it is also important to create a social habit .
The public insistence of cleanliness should not only be in the houses, in our entire village, in the entire city, in our state and in our country, cleanliness should be an integral part of these festivals.
My dear countrymen, the definitions of being modern are changing.
These days, a new dimension, a new parameter, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modern you are, how modern your thought-processes are.
In your own activities, eco-friendly, environment-friendly behavior is against that.
In society , if it is against it , it is considered bad today .
And as a result of that, today I see that these days, even in Ganeshotsav, an eco-friendly Ganapati has become a big campaign.
If you go to You Tube and see children in every house are making Ganesh ji, by bringing soil and making Ganesh ji
The use of the same is happening in every family
See how big change has come and this is a pleasant change
And as I said, our country is full of crores of stunning minds.
Three years ago, when the Swachhta campaign was started, it will be three years on October 2.
And, its positive results are visible.
The coverage of toilets has reached around 67 from 39.
More than 2 lakh 30 thousand villages have declared themselves free from open defecation.
In the past, there was a severe flood in Gujarat
Sufficient people lost their lives , but when the water was reduced after the flood , it was so dirty everywhere .
At such a time, in Dhanera of Banaskantha district of Gujarat, the workers of Jamiat Ulemayehind cleaned the flood affected 22 temples and 3 mosques in a phased manner.
Allah's sweat sweated, all of them came out
The best example of unity for cleanliness, such an example that inspires everyone, all the workers of Jamiat Ulemayehind gave
The dedicated effort for cleanliness, if it becomes our permanent nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I call upon all of you that once again 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, Swachhata Hi Seva used to say earlier like Jal Seva, this God Seva, Swachhata Hi Seva campaign.
Create an atmosphere for cleanliness all over the country
As soon as you get the opportunity, wherever you get the opportunity, we find opportunities.
But we all join
Assume it as a preparation for Diwali in a way, accept it as a preparation for Navaratri in a way, accept preparations for Durga Puja
My friends of social media can run a few constructive campaigns and can inspire the virtual world to work on the ground.
Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi Competition, this campaign by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in which you are the competition for essay, the competition for making short films, paintings and competitions are being organized.
In this you can write essays in different languages and there is no age limit, there is no age limit.
You can make short film, you can make it from your mobile
2-3 minute films can be made which inspire cleanliness
It can be in any language, it can be a silent too.
You see, how will it shine on October 2 of Gandhi Jayanti
You can imagine that after this 15-day cleanliness campaign, after Swachhata Hi Seva, when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti on 2nd October, how a sacred joy will be to pay homage to revered Bapu.
My dear countrymen, today I want to accept the loan of all of you in a particular way.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to you, not because you have been associated with Mann Ki Baat for so long, I would like to express my gratitude and accept loans because with this programme of Mann Ki Baat, millions of people join every corner of the country.
The number of listeners is in crores, but millions of people write to me sometimes, sometimes give me messages, sometimes the message comes on the phone, there is a huge treasure for me.
This has become a great opportunity for me to know the minds of the people of the country.
I wait for your messages more than you wait for your mind .
I'm greedy because I get to learn something from everything you have
You might also think yes, man, you've ever made such a mistake
Sometimes something becomes a part of our habit that we do not think we are wrongdoers .
Prime Minister, I am speaking to Poona, Aparna
I want to tell you about my friend
She always tries to help people but I am surprised to see a habit of it .
I once went to the mall shopping with him
On a sari, he spent two thousand rupees very comfortably and Rs 450 on the pizza, while the auto that was taken to go to the mall, the automan continued to pay for five rupees for a long time.
Returning and buying vegetables on the way and saving Rs 4-5 on every vegetable again
I feel very bad
You must tell me about your mind .
Now after listening to these phone calls, I am sure you must have been surprised, you might have become alert and maybe you might have decided not to make such a mistake.
Do you not think that whenever we come to sell a goods around our house, a round-the-clock person comes to a small shopkeeper, a small shopkeeper, a vegetable seller, sometimes we have a relationship with an auto-rickshaw person, whenever we have a relationship with a hard worker person, we start comforting him, we start comforting him, we start comfortably comforting him, we don't comfortably comfort him.
And we are the people who go to eat food in a big restaurant and don't even see what it is written in the bill.
Not only this, they can buy saris in the showroom, they don't make any cost-effects but if a poor person gets his relationship then they don't live without making any cost-effect.
What will happen to the poor mind, have you ever thought of it
There is no difference between your life of two rupees and five rupees but how much this small habit of you would have pushed his mind
Madam, I'm grateful to you, you gave me a message by calling the phone that touches so much.
I am sure my countrymen will also be habitual to behave with the poor .
My dear young friends, on August 29, the entire country celebrates the National Sports Day.
This is the birthday of the great hockey player and the magician of Hockey Major Dhyanchand ji
His contribution to Hockey was incomparable .
I am reminded of the fact that I want the new generation of our country to be associated with sports.
Sports become part of our life
If we are the young countries of the world, we should also be seen in the field of sports.
Sports i.e. physical fitness, men alert, personality enhancement I understand what more than that
Sports is in a way a very big medicinal herb of heart mixing .
The younger generation of our country came forward in the sports world and today in the age of computer, I would like to warn that playing field is more important than play-station.
Play a game but also in the field outside, sometimes show up with cootball
Crickets will be playing on computer but in the open field the joy of playing crickets below the sky is something else.
There was a time when the children of the family used to go out , the mother used to ask before when you would come back .
Today the situation is that when children come home, they either start watching cartoon films in one corner or get stuck on the mobile game and then they have to shout and say when will you go out
It is a matter of happiness for our youngsters that India is going to organise IAE Under 17 World Cup from 6th to 28th October.
24 teams from around the world are going to make India their home
Let us welcome our young guests from the world, welcome with the festival of sports, enjoy sports, create an atmosphere in the country.
When I am talking about sports today, I want to share one of my hearts with the very untouched events that took place last week.
I got the opportunity to meet some daughters of a very young age and some of them were born in the Himalayas .
Ever spent 40-40 days together in water
Sometimes 30-30 days will be spent in water
These six daughters with courage among the waves of the sea and this is the first event in the world .
Who will be Hindustanis who do not descend to our daughters
I salute these daughters and I have told them to share their experiences with the whole country.
I will also make a separate arrangement for their experiences on the Narendra Modi App so that you must read it because in a way this is a story of courage, a story of self-respect and I will be happy to bring these daughters to you.
My best wishes to these daughters and blessings.
My dear countrymen, on 5th September we all celebrate Teachers Day
The birthday of the former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan ji
He was the President but he used to present himself as a teacher throughout his life .
He always liked to live as a teacher
I bow down to them, the great scientist Albert Einstein said.
It is the Supreme Art of the Teacher to wake up with happiness in creative expression and knowledge. It is the most important feature of a teacher to enjoy creative emotions and knowledge among our students.
This time when we celebrate Teacher ' s Day , can we all resolve together
Can you run a campaign in a mission mode
If we make collective efforts then we will play a very big role in the transformation of the nation.
Let's try to transform this mantra
Salute Prime Minister
My name is Dr. Ananya Awasthi
I am a resident of Mumbai City and work for the India Research Centre of the World University.
My dear countrymen, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been a topic of discussion on the pundits of the economic world not only in India but also in the world.
On August 28, 2014, this campaign was started by taking a dream in mind.
On August 28, this campaign of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana is going on for three years.
30 crore new families have been linked to this, bank account has been opened.
This number is more than the population of many countries in the world .
Today, I have a big solution that within three years my poor brother sitting on the last corner of the society has become a part of the country's economy, his habit has changed, he has started coming to the bank, he has started saving money, he is feeling the security of the money.
Sometimes money lives in hand, lives in jewellery, is in the house, then he feels like spending fun.
If you have to do a good job in the coming days , money will come to work .
In the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, about 65 thousand crore rupees have been deposited by our poor in banks.
This is the saving of the poor in a way . This is his strength in the coming days .
And with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the account opened has also got the benefit of insurance.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Rs.
In many families, due to insurance of one rupee, when the poor man suffered a crisis, the head of the family ended, he got Rs. 2 lakh in a few days.
Be it the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, the Startup Yojana, the Standup Yojana, the Dalits, the tribals, the women, the youngsters who are intended to do something by standing on their feet, millions of youngsters who have got no guarantee from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, the banks and they themselves stand on their feet.
Today is not so much time but I will definitely tell the people of the bank that they should upload it on MyGov.in, people will be inspired by the fact that a scheme brings transformation in the life of a person, how it fills new energy and how it fills new confidence, hundreds of examples of this thing have come to me.
I will try my best to reach you and there is such an inspiring event that the people of the media can also take full advantage of it .
They can also inspire the new generation by integrating such people.
Man's mind is such that the rainy season is a very pleasant period for the mind.
Animals, birds, plants, nature everybody gets happy at the arrival of rain.
But sometimes when the rain takes a dramatic form, it is known that there is also a great power to destroy water.
Nature gives us life, but sometimes natural calamities like floods, earthquakes, its terrible nature destroys us very much.
The changes in the changing weather cycle and the environment are also being negatively impacted.
For the past few days, some parts of India, particularly Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Bengal, have suffered natural calamities due to excessive rainfall.
Flood affected areas are being monitored.
Relief work is being done at a broader level.
Wherever possible, my colleagues of the Council of Ministers are also reaching there.
State governments are also making every effort to help the flood victims in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and citizens working with service are also making every effort to help the people in such a situation.
On behalf of the Government of India, the soldiers of the Army, the people of the Air Force, the people of the NCR, the Paramilitary Forces, everybody gets involved in serving disaster victims at such times.
And 247 control from helpline number 1078 is constantly working to deal with the situation of floods.
People also tell their difficulties.
The entire government system was prepared by drilling mock at most places before the rainy season.
NCR teams were installed.
Gradually we also made the nature that according to the weather forecast, we can also create our activities, then we can avoid losses.
Whenever I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that citizens of the country prepare more than me.
This time there have been so many letters about GST, so many phone calls have come and people still express happiness and curiosity about GST.
I also tell you a phone call: Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am speaking Netu Garg from Gurgaon.
I heard the speech of your Chartered Accountants Day and was very impressed.
Similarly, Goods and Services Tax-GST was started in our country on the date of last month.
Can you tell me whether the results are coming after a month as the government had executed
I would like to hear your thoughts about this, thank you.
GST has been implemented for nearly a month and its benefits have started to appear.
And I am very happy that when a poor person writes a letter to me and tells me how the prices of poor things have been reduced due to GST and how cheap things have been made.
If a person living in the forests in the north-east, far-flung mountains writes a letter that in the beginning it was feared that what was not known but now when I started learning in it, then I think it was easier to do it.
Business became easier.
And the biggest thing is that customers' confidence in the trader has started increasing.
Just now I was seeing how GST was imparted on the transport and logistics sector.
How the movement of trucks has increased now
How the time is decreasing
Highways clutters are ready.
Pollution has also decreased due to the speed of trucks.
The goods are also reaching very quickly.
This is not only the facility but also the economic pace is strengthened.
Earlier, due to various tax structures, the maximum resources of the transport and logistics sector were engaged in maintaining the paperwork and they had to make new warehouses within every state.
GST which I call Good and Simple Tax, in fact it has created a very positive impact on our economy and in a very short time.
The speed at which smooth transmission has taken place, the speed at which migration has been done, new registrations have created a new confidence throughout the country.
And sometimes the pundits of the economy, the pundits of the management, the pundits of technology, the use of GST of India will definitely be written in the form of a model in front of the world.
There will be a case study for many universities in the world.
Because such a big change at such a large scale and with the innovation of crores of people, it is a huge height of success in such a large country.
The world will definitely study on this.
And GST has been implemented, all the states have participation in it, all the states have the responsibility.
All the decisions have been made by the states and the Center together with consensus.
And the result of that is that every government had the same priority that there was no burden on the poor plate due to GST.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries engaged in this work, to all the departments, to all the accused of the central and state government.
GST is an excellent example of the success of Indias collective power.
This is a historic achievement.
And this is not just a tax reform, it is an economy that strengthens the culture of a new honesty.
There is also a campaign for social reform in a way.
Once again I salute the people of Koti-Koti to make such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the revolution.
We have been listening to this simplely since childhood and because of this, the non-cooperation movement started on 1st August, 1920.
The uit India Movement was launched on 9th August, 1942, known as the August Revolution and the country was freed on 15th August, 1947.
In a way, in the month of August, many events have been specially linked to the Tawari of Independence.
But very few people know that leave India this slogan was given by Dr. Yusuf Mehr Ali.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, the countrymen who continued to fight and struggle with the glimpse of freedom, the pages of history are our inspiration to build a magnificent India.
The heroes of our freedom have sacrificed, penance and sacrifice, what can be a great inspiration
The uit India Movement was an important struggle for the Indian freedom movement.
This movement had resolved the whole country to liberate from the British-Raja.
This was the time when the people of India had become a part of the uit India movement in every corner of India, whether it is village, city, whether it is read, illiterate, poor or rich in opposition to the British power.
The public outrage was on its peak.
On the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were throwing their lives in the struggle with the mantra of death.
Millions of youth of the country had left their studies, left books.
The non-cooperation movement and the uit India Movement show two different forms of Mahatma Gandhi in 1920 and 1942.
The forms of non-cooperation movement were different and the situation of 42 came, the intensity increased so much that the great man like Mahatma Gandhi did or gave the mantra of death.
There was mass support, peoples strength, peoples resolve and peoples struggle behind all this success.
The whole country was fighting together.
And sometimes I think that if we look at the pages of history by adding a little then India's first freedom struggle took place in 1857.
The freedom struggle, which started from 1857, continued every moment in some corner of the country till 1942.
This long period created a glimpse of freedom in the hearts of the countrymen.
Everyone was committed to doing something or the other.
Generations changed, but there was no shortage of resolution.
The country was trying every moment to overthrow the British Sultanate.
This labour from 1857 to 1942 created a situation that 1942 reached its peak and quit India was such a bugle that within 5 years the British had to go in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, he reached the people of Lalak.
And from 1942 to 1947, it became a people's mind, it became the reason for the country's independence with success as a five decisive year of achievement.
These five years were decisive years.
Now I want to add you to this math.
We were free in 1947.
Today is 2017.
It's almost 70 years.
Governments came-Gay
Arrangements were made, changed, increased.
Everyone has tried their own way to free the country from problems.
Successes were also found.
Expectations also wake up.
Like 1942 to 1947, Siddhi had a decisive five years of resolution.
I see that from 2017 to 2022, we have come to the forefront of another five years of achievement.
On August 15, 2017, we celebrate as a resolution festival and when 75 years of independence in 2022, we will continue to transform that resolution into achievement.
There should be crores of resolutions.
Efforts should be made to fulfill crores of resolutions.
So, since 1942 to 1947, the country became decisive for independence, these five years can become decisive and decisive for the future of India from 2017 to 2022.
Five years later, the country will celebrate 75 years of independence.
Then we all have to take a strong resolution today.
2017 is to make a year of our resolve.
We have to join this August month resolution and we have to resolve.
Come, in the month of August 9, run a Mahabhiyan of Siddhi from Sankalp.
A resolution that we will prove in the next 5 years.
Youth organizations, student organizations, NGOs etc. can organize collective discussions.
You can expose new ideas.
Where do we have to reach as a nation
What can I contribute to it as a person
Let us join the festival of this resolution.
Video, Post, Blog, articles, new ideas used to use technology.
Convert this campaign into a mass movement.
This is an attempt to connect ui to the glorious history of the country and introduce the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am convinced that you must propagate it, spread it.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, as the Prime Servant of the country, I get the opportunity to interact with the country with the Red Fort.
I am only a moment and there he doesn't speak a person.
The voice of hundreds of millions of countrymen from the Red Fort echoes.
And I am glad that from every corner of the country on 15th August for the last 3 years, I suggest what should I say on 15th August
This time too, I invite you to send your ideas to me on MyGov either on the Narendra ModiApp.
I myself read it and I will try to disclose it in the time I have on August 15.
In the last 3 years, I have heard a complaint in my speeches on August 15 that my speech becomes slightly long.
I have tried to make rules for me in more than 40-45-50 minutes.
I don't know if I can't do it.
But I intend to try this time how to make my speech short .
See, if you do not get success or not.
I want to do another thing today, my countrymen.
There is a social economics in India's economy.
And we should never reduce it.
Our festivals, our festivals, they are just an opportunity for happiness and prosperity.
Our festivals, our festivals are also a campaign for social reform.
And these festivals also add a simple natural joy.
Festivals bring sweetness in relations, affection in the family, brotherhood in society.
Add people and society.
There is a simple journey from the person to the committee.
There is an opportunity to go from Akh to Yam.
As far as the economy is concerned, many months before Rakhi, hundreds of families start making rakhis in small domestic industries.
From Khadi to silk threads, rakhis and nowadays people like homemade rakhis.
The business of thousands of sweets and thousands of sweets connects with a festival.
Our poor brothers and sisters, this is what the families go through.
We burn lamps in Deepawali, it is just a light festival, it is not just a festival, it is a beauty of the house, it is not so.
He is directly related to those poor families who have given small soil.
But today when I talk about the poor economy associated with festivals and festivals, I would like to talk about the environment as well.
I have seen that sometimes I think the countrymen are more aware and more active than me.
For the last one month, citizens conscious of the environment have written letters to me.
And he has urged you to tell Ganesh Chaturthi about eco-friendly Ganesh before time so that people plan on the choice of soil Ganesh.
First of all, I am grateful to such aware citizens.
He has urged me to say on this topic before time.
This time public Ganeshotsav has a special significance.
The original spirit with which Lokmanya Tilak ji had started the public Ganeshotsav for the rites of collectiveness for the unity and awareness of the society.
Once again we should compete for this year of Ganeshotsav, discuss meetings, remember the contribution of Lokmanya Tilak.
And this time I said very quickly .
I am sure that all of you will join me and the benefit will be that the poor artisans, the poor artists, the idols that make them will get employment, the poor will fill the stomach.
I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen for the festivals and for the festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly watching that be it education sector, economic sector, social sector, sports, our daughters are illuminating the name of the country and getting new heights.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters.
In the past, our daughters performed greatly in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
I got the opportunity to meet all those players daughters this week.
I felt very good by talking to them but I was feeling that the world up could not win it was a huge burden on them.
He also had pressure on his face, there was tension.
I told those daughters and I gave me a different evaluation.
I said, Nowadays the time of media is such that the expectations are increased so much and when success is not achieved then it also turns into anger.
We have seen many such games that if the players of India failed, the country's anger breaks on those players.
Some people break the limits and speak such things, write such things, there is a lot of pain.
But for the first time, when our daughters did not succeed in the World Cup, hundreds of millions of countrymen took that defeat on their shoulders.
Not only did the burden of those daughters, they praised and proud of what they did.
I see it a pleasant change and I told these daughters that you should see that you have got such a good fortune only to you people and take it out of your mind that you have not succeeded.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won 1. 25 billion countrymen.
My dear countrymen, once again reminds me of the August Revolution, once again on 9th August, once again on 15th August, I remind you of 2022, 75 years of independence.
Every countryman should make a pledge, every countryman should prepare a 5-year roadmap to prove his resolve.
We all have to take the country to new heights, reach and reach.
Come, let's go together, let's do something or the other.
The fate of the country, the future will be better and move forward with this belief.
Changing weather
This time the heat is also very much
But it ' s good that the rain is moving ahead on your map in time .
In many parts of the country, the weather has become pleasant with Jhajjam rains.
After the rains, cold winds have experienced relief from the heat of the past days.
And we all have seen that however turmoil in life, however stress, however individual life, public life, the arrival of rain changes our mindset.
Today, the chariot journey of Lord Jagannath ji is celebrated with great devotion and joy in many parts of the country.
Now in some parts of the world the festival of Lord Jagannath ji ' s Rath Yatra is celebrated .
And the poorest of the country is associated with Lord Jagannath ji .
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor .
And very few people will know, there is a word in English language juggernaut and it means a grand chariot that no one can stop.
And in this juggernaut's dictionary meaning, it is also found that this word has emerged from the chariot of Jagannatha.
And that is why we can understand how the world has accepted this journey of Jagannath in its own way .
On the occasion of the visit of Lord Jagannath ji, I extend my best wishes to all the countrymen and also bow to Lord Jagannath ji in the shrines of Lord Jagannath ji.
The diversity of India is also its feature, the diversity of India is also the power of India.
The holy month of Ramzan celebrated with a holy spirit in worship .
Now is the festival of Eid
My best wishes to everyone on this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr.
The month of Ramzan is a month of virtue donation, the month of sharing of happiness and the more happiness they share, the more happiness increases.
Let us all share the treasures of happiness with inspiration from these holy festivals together, let us move the country forward.
In this holy month of Ramzan a major inspiring event of Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh came to me .
About three and a half thousand families of our Muslim brothers and sisters live in that small village. In a way more population is from the brothers and sisters of our Muslim family.
Inside this Ramzan the villagers decided to build toilets together .
And this individual toilet also helps the government and that assistance was given to them about Rs . 17 lakhs .
You spend these 17 lakhs for other facilities in the village
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for this sacred occasion of Ramadan on the occasion of the well-being of the society.
We know that there are three states in our country, Sikkim, Himachal and Kerala, they have already been declared ODF.
Uttarakhand and Haryana were also declared this week
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the administration of these five states, to the governance and to the people and people for fulfilling this work.
We are well aware that in the life of a person, in the life of a society, we have to work hard.
If our handwriting is bad, if it is to be corrected then we have to make efforts to be very aware for a long time.
Then the habit of the body, the habit of mind changes
The topic of cleanliness is also the same
Such bad habits have become part of our nature .
Everyone will have to attract attention
Good motivating events will also have to be remembered again and again
And I am glad that cleanliness has not been a government programme today.
This is going on becoming a movement of masses and masses.
And when the people sitting in the regime go ahead with public participation, how much strength it increases
In the past, a very excellent event came to me, which I would like to say to you.
This is the incident of Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh
The administration there took a big job from public participation .
100 hours non-stop campaign
And what was the goal
Making ten thousand domestic toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in a hundred hours
And my dear countrymen, you will be happy to know that the people and the people and the government have successfully completed the construction of 10,000 toilets in the next 100 hours.
71 villages
I congratulate the people sitting in the government, the government officials and the citizens of those villages of Vijayanagaram district for presenting a very inspiring example while performing hard work.
They come to the Narendra ModiApp, come to MyGov. in, come from letters, come on the AIR.
Recalling the Emergency, Shri Prakash Tripathi has written that on 25th June he has presented as a black period in the history of democracy.
This awareness of Prakash Tripathi ji's democracy is commendable and democracy is a system, it is not like that, it is also a ritual.
Eternal awareness is required towards democracy and hence there is a need to remember the trauma of democracy and move towards the good things of democracy.
1975 - June 25 - It was a black night that no democracy lover can forget.
No Indian can forget.
In a way, the country was converted into a prisoner.
The anti-vocal voice was dumped
The dignitaries of the country including Jaiprakash Narayan were locked in jails.
The justice system was also unable to escape the shadow of that horrific form of emergency.
The newspapers were completely wasted.
Democracy lovers fought a big fight and when a country like India, such a huge country, when it got an opportunity, how democracy is in the face of the people of India, through the elections, it has demonstrated that power.
We have to empower this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling the pride of doing his head up in the world today.
21st June, 2017 - The entire world became Yogamayam.
From water to mountains, people welcomed the sun rays in the morning through Yoga.
Who will be Hindustani, who will not be proud of this thing.
It is not that Yoga did not happen before, but today when Yoga has been tied in the threshold of Yoga, Yoga has become the reason for connecting the world.
Nearly all the countries of the world have made this occasion of Yoga an opportunity.
People practiced Yoga on the top of the Great All of China in China, the world heritage site Machu Pichu in Peru has done Yoga at 2400 meters above sea level.
People performed Yoga in the shadow of Eiffel Tower in France.
Small locations like Singapore have been organized at 70 locations and they have launched a week-long campaign.
NDRF removes 10 stamps of International Day of Yoga.
DOGA Session with Yoga Masters organized at NDFFC
The State of the NEC, Diplomats of the world, everybody participated in it.
This time again, Yoga also worked as a world record
About 55 thousand people in Ahmedabad in Gujarat made a new world record by doing Yoga together
I also got the opportunity to attend the Yoga programme in Lucknow .
But for the first time I got the privilege of doing Yoga in the rain .
Our soldiers also performed Yoga in Siachen where there is Minus 20, 25, 40 Degree Temperature.
Be it TBP, ORP, ICS, everybody has made Yoga a part of its duty as well as its duty.
On this Yoga Day, I had said that three generations, because this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of the family should share photographs of Yoga together.
Some TC Channell also carried forward this point
Sir, I have a question that in the recently Kerala, we had heard you that instead of giving a gift as a gift to the different-direcent places we should give kind of good books to us as a memento.
You had also started this thing during your tenure in Gujarat, sir, but now in recent days we are not getting to see this much.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had created a tradition in the government that we would not give a boute, book or handloom, handkerchie would welcome him.
And the handkerchie of khadi so that khadi can also be promoted
As long as I was in Gujarat, all of us had become a habit, but after coming here my habit was lost.
But went to Kerala, then once again he became aware
And I ' ve just started informing the government below again
We can gradually create a nature .
And the bouquet ' s age is very low .
Once taken in hand, then leave
But if you give books then in a way it becomes a part of the house and becomes a part of the family.
And when I'm talking about it, how historical is the value of such things
When I went to K last year, British ueen, ueen Liabeth had invited me to dinner in Hondon.
There was a maternal atmosphere
He also fed me with great love, but later he showed me a small handkerchie weighed with a khadi and a threshold in an emotional voice with great respect and brightness in his eyes, he said that when I was married, this handkerchie Mahatma Gandhi had sent me to the wedding best wishes.
How many years have passed, but ueen Liabeth has taken over this handkerchie given by Mahatma Gandhi.
A small meeting of Mahatma Gandhi became part of his life, became part of his history.
I am confident that these habits do not change overnight and whenever they talk like this, they also have to be a victim of criticism.
But in spite of this, you should continue to do such things, you should continue to try
Now I cannot say that I will go somewhere and somebody will come with a bouquet and I will refuse it, I will not be able to do it.
But still there will be criticism, but if you will continue to talk, then gradually there will be improvement.
My dear countrymen, as Prime Minister, there are many types of work.
They are immersed in files, but I have developed a habit for me that I read a few letters daily from the letters I received and that gives me an opportunity to join the common man.
Like letters come, different types of people write letters
These days I got the opportunity to read a letter, I think I must tell you.
In a far-flung south, in Tamil Nadu, a housewife Arulmozhi Sarvanan from Madurai - he sent me a letter
And what was the letter, he wrote that if I thought in the direction of making some economic activity in the mind of the children's education in my family, then the family should get some financial help.
So I started some work from the Mudra Yojana, money from the bank and supplied some goods from the market.
In such a situation, I came to mind that the Government of India has created a system called Government-Marketplace.
So I have made myself a registrar in it. I want to tell the countrymen that if you also get an opportunity, then you will be able to get the opportunity.
There ' s a big new kind of arrangement
And then he has to order .
All the departments of the government keep watching those people who get registration done within the GM.
Because of not intermediaries , things are very cheap .
Now this Arulmozhi Madam has made all the registry of the goods that the government can give on this website.
And fun is that the letter he wrote to me is a big interesting.
This is Empowerment
This is the opportunity to promote entrepreneurship.
Perhaps Arulmozhi ji had not written a letter to me, I might have not even noticed that a housewife is doing a small job far away from the system of GM, his goods can be bought to the Prime Minister's Office.
This is the power of the country .
There is also a transparency in it, there is also an empowerment in it and it also has an entrepreneurship.
I would surely like those who want to sell their goods to the government in such a way should be more connected than that.
I believe that Minimum Government and Maimum Government is an excellent example of this and what is its goal is Minimum Price and Maimum Ease, Efficiency and Transparency
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga, on the other hand we can also proud of our achievements in space science.
And this is the specialty of India that if our feet are on the earth associated with Yoga, our dreams are also to cross the horizons of the far-flung heavens.
In the past, India has shown a lot in sports and in science too.
Today, India is not only on earth but also in space.
Just two days ago, ISR launches 30 Nano Satellites with Cartosat-2 series satellites
And these satellites include about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain, America, besides India.
And this non-satellite campaign of India will help us in the field of agriculture, in the field of agriculture and in the field of natural calamities.
And in the satellite launched by India so far, this is the most weighty Heavy satellite.
And the newspapers of our country had compared it to the weights of the elephants, so you can imagine how big work our scientists have done in the field of space.
On June 19, a thousand days of the Mars Mission have been completed
You all will be aware that when we had successfully built a place in Orbit for the Mars Mission, this entire mission was for a period of 6 months.
Finishing a thousand days is an important halt in our space journey within our scientific journey.
These days in sports too, we see that the trend of our youth is increasing.
Now it has started to see that along with studies, our younger generations have started showing their future in sports and due to our players, their mentorship and their achievements, the name of the country is also illuminated.
Recently, India's Badminton Player Kidambi Shrikant has won the Indonesia Open and enhanced the value of the country
I heartily congratulate him and his coach for this achievement.
A few days ago, I had got the opportunity to join the inaugural function of the Synthetic Track of Athlete P.
As much as we will promote sports, sports, sportsman spirit.
Sports also play a very important role in the development of personality .
There is a lot of importance of sports in the overall personality development.
There is no shortage of talent in the country
If children are interested in sports in our family, then they should give opportunities.
Everyone should dream for the next lympic
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season, the atmosphere of festivals, in a way the feeling of this period is new.
I will once again convey my best wishes to you all and talk to you at the time of the next mind .
We will hardly forget the heat of this year.
But the rain is waiting.
Today, when I am talking to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramzan, I extend my warm greetings to the people of India and the world, especially the Muslim community, on this holy month.
This is such a country that also those who believe in God and those who deny God, those who worship idols and those who oppose idol worship, every kind of ideology, every kind of worship, every kind of tradition, we have imbibed the art of living together.
And finally, be it religion, community, ideology, tradition, this is the message of peace, unity and goodwill.
This holy month of Ramzan will definitely help in pursuing this path of peace, unity and goodwill.
Once again I congratulate everyone.
I am happy that a lot of people gave me a feedback.
Everyone showed the enthusiasm to tell me personally.
I have not been able to read everything, I have not even heard everybody's message, so many things have come.
However, some people are trying to learn new things using your tubes and trying to learn new languages.
Some people are learning cooking, some are learning dance, some are learning drama, some have written that we have started writing poems now.
Knowing nature, living, understanding are trying in that direction.
When I started reading about the freedom struggle, I realized how much India had to struggle for independence and how many freedom fighters spent years in jails.
I am very inspired by Bhagat Singh, who has achieved a lot at a very young age, so I request you to give some messages to the generation of today.
I am happy that the younger generation is interested in knowing our history, our freedom fighters and those who sacrificed their lives for this country.
Many years ago I went to Andaman Nicobar.
The cellular jail went to see.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji.
Veer Savarkar ji wrote a maji-born book in jail.
Poems used to write, write on the walls.
They were closed in a small cell.
The freedom fighters would have suffered the torture.
When Savarkar ji's Maji was born, I read a book and from that I got inspiration to see a cellular jail.
There is also a light and sound show programme that is very inspiring.
There was no such state in India, there would be no language speaking in India, which would not be able to consume his youth in the jails of Andaman, in this cellular jail, facing the punishment of black water for freedom.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar ji, the people of every language, every province and every generation had suffered torture.
I will surely say to the younger generation of the country that the people had suffered the torture of the freedom that we have got, how much pain they had suffered, if we go to the cellular jail and see why was it called black water
My dear countrymen, June 5 is the first Monday of the month.
Connect from natural means nurturing the Better Plant.
And who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi used to say several times that the world we will not see, it is our duty to worry about it, we will also care for it.
You have come very tired, open the windows of the room, open the doors, breathe fresh air - a new consciousness comes.
When the punchs that have been made up of the body, when those punch ghosts come in contact with them, a new consciousness appears in our body, a new energy emerges.
We all have experienced this but we do not register it, we do not add it to a thread and a formula.
After this, you must see that whenever you get connected to the natural situation, you will have a new consciousness and therefore, the global campaign to connect with nature of 5th June should become our own campaign.
Our ancestors protected the environment, we are getting some benefit from it.
If we protect then our future generations will get the benefit.
Earth and environment are considered to be the root of power in the Vedas.
And Atharvaveda is completely, in a way, the biggest guiding book of the environment and it has been written thousands of years ago.
We have said Mother Land : Sons Important Prithviya :
It has been said in the Vedas that the purity that we have is due to our earth.
Earth is our mother and we are their sons.
If we remember Lord Buddha, one thing is certainly highlighted that Mahatma Buddha was born, he got knowledge and his great-parinirvana was under the three trees.
These days I keep getting news from the states.
As soon as the rain comes in almost all the states, a very big campaign of tree plantation takes place.
Crores of plants are planted.
Children of the school are also connected, social-service organisations join, NGOs join, the government itself takes initiatives.
This time we also promote and contribute to this work of plantation in the rainy season.
My dear countrymen, June 21 has now become a known day for the world on June 21.
As World Yoga Day, the whole world celebrates it.
In a very short time, this World Yoga Day of June 21 has failed in every corner and is connecting people.
On one hand, many powers of scattering in the world are showing their deformed face, in such a situation, India has a great contribution to the world.
Through yoga, we have added the world to a formula.
As Yoga connects body, mind, intelligence and soul, today Yoga is also connecting the world.
Today, due to lifestyle, due to compassion, increasing responsibilities, it is becoming difficult to live a life free of stress.
And this situation has reached even in the younger age of being seen.
The role of yoga is important to take medicines and to pass the day, to lead a stress-free life in such a time.
Yoga is the guarantee of both wellness and fitness.
Yoga is not just exercise.
It is possible to experience the interval of health from the body, from the mind, from the body, from the thoughts and from the thoughts.
Just two days ago, I have written a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world about Yoga Day.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to Yoga, some rewards have been announced.
Gradually work will move forward in that direction.
He said that this is the third International Yoga Day and said to me that you appeal that this time three generations of the same family should do yoga together on the third International Yoga Day.
Be it grandmother or grandmother or grandmother, be it parents, sons and daughters, all three generations should do yoga together and upload their pictures.
Tomorrow, today and tomorrow, there will be a good coincidence that Yoga will get a new dimension.
I thank you for this suggestion and I also feel that as we had launched a campaign with Daughter and had a very interesting experience.
These three-generation pictures of Yoga will surely be complimented for the country and the world.
You must send a picture to me at the Narendra Modi App, wherever three generations do Yoga at MyGov.
Tomorrow, this will be a picture of today and tomorrow, which will be the guarantee of tomorrow.
I invite you all.
We have about three weeks for International Day of Yoga.
You should also propagate the subject of Yoga for three weeks, spread it, add people.
In a way, this is the movement of preventive health care.
I invite you all to join it.
This phone call will bring you to mind: Pranam Modi ji, I am from Naina Mumbai.
Today I always see Modi Ji on TV and in social medicine wherever you go, people of that place pay special attention to cleanliness.
Be it Mumbai or Surat, people have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission on your call.
Large and big, there is awareness about cleanliness in children too.
Many times they have seen the elders spreading dirt on the road, spreading dirt.
There the government machinery works as cleaning but these days there is a celebration of cleanliness in society too.
Five days before my departure, seven days ago, ten days ago, there are a lot of cleanliness programmes.
The media also gives him a great priority and just a few days ago I went to Kutch in Gujarat.
There was a very big cleanliness campaign.
I did not even see it added.
But when this phone call came, I also started thinking and I saw that it was true.
You can imagine, I am happy to know how well the country is notifying these things in a better way.
What will be the greatest pleasure for me that cleanliness has also been added to my visit.
The rest of the preparations for the Prime Minister's reception will be habitual, but cleanliness will be a major thing.
It is enjoyable and inspiring for any cleanliness lover in itself.
I congratulate all those who have emphasized the work of cleanliness.
Someone gave me a suggestion.
Well, that's a funny suggestion.
I do not know, I will be able to do it or not.
Modi ji, while deciding your migration, tell them that if I have to call then how will the level of cleanliness be
How many tons of waste and waste will you meet me on the basis of that, I will decide my stay.
Dea is very good but I have to think.
How big humanity will be the work.
One thing I would like to say is that we do not consider the waste that this waste is health, it is a source.
Do not see it as just a carbage.
Once we start considering this waste as health, many new ways of waste management will come in front of us.
With the help of the State Governments, the Government of India has decided to launch a major campaign of waste management with the help of peoples representatives from the cities.
On 5th June, World Environment Day, solid waste and liquid waste will be available in nearly 4,000 cities of the country.
Two types of dustbins will be available, one of green colors and the other of blue color.
Like the waste that comes out of kitchen, the peels of vegetables, the remaining food, the peels of eggs, the leaves of trees and plants etc. all these are wet wastes and put them in the green dustbin.
All these things are such that can be used in the field and if you remember the color of the farm then what to put in the green dustbin will be remembered.
Today I have to mention one thing with pride - even if a person decides in mind then how big a mass movement can be created.
Cleanliness work is the same.
And the way they connected the people of the entire region and converted them into a mass movement, this is an inspirational example in itself.
In the context of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, the Riyasi Block of Jammu and Kashmir was told that the Riyasi Block has been Open Defecation Free (Open Defecation Free).
I congratulate everyone for this.
And I was told that the entire movement has been made the highest-ever- the women of that area of Jammu and Kashmir.
He took out torch journeys to create awareness and inspired the people of the streets and streets.
My dear countrymen, for the last 15 days, for the past 15 months, there has been an accounting of 3 years of the present government be it TV channel or social media.
I see this process as a very healthy science.
How has this 3-year term been done on every criterion
The people of every section of the society have analysised it.
And there is a best process in democracy.
And I clearly believe that the governments should be accountable in democracy, the people and the people should give account of their work.
I thank all those people who took time to discuss our work in depth, somewhere appreciated, somewhere support came, somewhere deficiencies were removed, I understand the importance of all these things.
Whether it is good, it is less good, it is bad, whatever it is, it is to learn from it and to move forward with the help of it.
Constructive criminalism emphasizes democracy.
For a conscious nation, for a conscious nation, this churning is very important.
My dear countrymen, I am also a common citizen like you and as a common citizen, everything is well-effected on me as it is on the minds of any common citizen.
Some people also comment on Mann Ki Baat as a one-sided dialogue, but after such a long time I feel that when I started talking about Mann Ki Baat, I did not even think about it.
It seems as if I sit in the house in the middle of the family and talk about the house.
And there are hundreds of families who have sent me by writing these things.
I express my gratitude to the President, to the Vice President, to the Speaker that he had given this importance to the people sitting in such a senior post by extracting time.
In a way, gave a new dimension to mind in itself.
Some of our friends were working on the book of Mann Ki Baat, they had ever discussed with me.
Abu Dhabi artist is known as Akbar Saheb. Akbar Saheb proposed from the front that the topics that have been discussed in Mann Ki Baat want to prepare his skate through his art and to show his love without taking a single rupee, Akbar Saheb gave the form of art.
I'm grateful to Akbar sir.
My dear countrymen, till the next time I meet you, the rains will have come in every corner of the country, the weather will have changed, the results of the examinations will have come, the beginning of a new life will start. And as soon as the rain comes, a new pleasure, a new fragrance, a new fragrance.
Come, let us all go ahead with love for nature in this environment.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
S.
Whether this aspect can be slightly emphasized in skill development
You can cycle, but the three-wheeler cycle that takes people - ever tried to run
Most of the families in every corner of the country will be engaged in the team of their children
Those who have been exhausted, there will be a lot of relief and there will be a lot of pressure in those families where they will run.
But at such a time, I will say that the last time I have spoken to the students in the matter of mind, listen to them again, those things will definitely help you at the time of the examination.
Today is 26th March
March 26 is Bangladesh's Independence Day
A historic battle against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh
And I wish Bangladesh proceed, develop, and I assure the people of Bangladesh that India is a strong partner of Bangladesh, a good friend and we will continue to contribute to peace, security and development in this entire region.
We all are proud of the fact that Tagore, his memories, our shared heritage.
The national anthem of Bangladesh is also the composition of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore
A very interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore is that in 1913, he was not only the first Asian person to receive the Nobel Prize, but he was also given the title of Knighthood by the British.
And when the British killed Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was among the great men who raised their voice and this was the period when this incident had a deep impact on the minds of a 12-year-old child.
In adolescence, the brutal massacre of Jallianwala Bagh gave a new inspiration to the child laughing in the fields and fields.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old kid Bhagat is our beloved, the inspiration of all of us - Shaheed Bhagat Singh
Three days before today, on March 23, Bhagat Singh ji and his companions, Sukhdev and Rajguru were hanged by the British and we all know that the incident on March 23 - the satisfaction of serving mother-Bharti on the face of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru - There was no fear of death.
All the dreams of life were incorporated for the freedom of Mother India
And these three brave brave ones are still inspiring to all of us.
We will not be able to decorate the story of the sacrifice of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru in words .
And the whole British Sultanate was afraid of these three youths .
The prisoners were locked in jail, the hanging was fixed, but the British were worried about how to move forward with them.
And then it was to be hanged on March 24, but it was given on March 23.
It was stolen, which is not usually done
And later the British had quietly burnt their body in today's Punjab.
Several years ago, when I had got the opportunity to visit there for the first time, I used to experience a kind of vibration in that land.
And I will definitely say to the youngsters of the country - whenever they get the opportunity, whenever they go to Punjab, they must go to the place of the tomb of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt.
This was the period when the glimpse of freedom, its intensity and its spread was increasing.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for the armed revolution.
So just a hundred years ago - April 10, 1917 - Mahatma Gandhi had performed Champaran Satyagraha
This is the centenary year of Champaran Satyagraha .
For the first time in the movement of India's freedom, Gandhi thought and Gandhi style, the form of this was seen in Champaran.
It was a turning point in the entire movement of freedom, especially in the way of struggle.
This was the period, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Kheda Satyagraha, the strike of mill-workers in Ahmedabad, and in all these, there was a deep impact of Mahatma Gandhi's idea and style of functioning.
In 1915, Gandhi returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and gave a new inspiration to the country
Today, we cannot evaluate Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the image of Mahatma Gandhi in our mind.
Imagine that a person who came back to India in 1915, only two years of tenure
Neither the country knew them nor their influence, it was just the beginning.
We can imagine how hard they had to suffer at that time, how hard they had to do.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such that in which Mahatma Gandhi's organisational skills, Mahatma Gandhi's power to know the phrase of Indian society, Mahatma Gandhi through his behaviour, the poorest of the poor in front of the British Sultanate, organising, motivating the uneducated person for the struggle, bringing him to the ground for the struggle.
And that is why we feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi .
But if you think of Gandhi a hundred years ago, Gandhi with that Champaran Satyagraha, Champaran Satyagraha is a very study for any person who starts public life.
How can public life be started, how much hard it has to be done and how Gandhi did it, we can learn from them.
And that was the time when we listened to the names of the big leaders, Gandhi had sent Rajendra Babu, Acharya Kripalani ji and everyone to the villages.
Filling the jail on one hand, on the other hand, consuming yourself in creative works
A wonderful balance was in the style of Gandhi's work.
What happens in the word Satyagraha, what can be disagreement, what happens in front of such a large Sultanate - a whole new emotion was established by Gandhi not through words but by a successful experiment.
Today, when we are living in the 21st century, then who would be such an Indian who would not want to change India, who would be an Indian who would not want to be a partner for change in the country
India is neither a government programme nor a political party's manifestation nor a project.
India calls for 1. 25 billion Indians
This is the feeling that hundred and a half million countrymen want to make a grand India together.
There are many people who go to the hospital everyday, help patients
There are many people, they run for blood donation as soon as they know.
There are many people, someone is hungry, so they worry about his food.
Our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara
Public service is the Lord-Service, this is in our ragas.
Once we see it as a collective, organised, how big it is
If it is a matter of India then it is very natural to criticize it, to consider it, to see it from different points of view and it is necessity in democracy.
But it is true that if 1. 25 billion countrymen decide the path to fulfil their resolve, take one step after another, then the dream of a New India can be proved in front of our eyes.
And it is not necessary that all these things are from the budget, government projects and government funds.
If every citizen pledges to follow the rules of the track, if every citizen pledges that I will fulfill my responsibilities with honesty, if every citizen pledges that one day in a week I will not use petrol-disell in his life.
You can see this country, the dream of a New India that is dreaming of 1. 25 billion Indians, they will be able to come true in front of their eyes.
Saying means that every citizen follows his citizen's religion, follows duty.
So why do not we also join Swaraj by disciplining our lives in this journey of Suraj
Let me invite you.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude today.
In the last few months, there was an atmosphere in our country and a large number of people joined the Digital Payment Digital Movement.
How can be transactions without cash, his curiosity has also increased, he is trying to learn the poorest of the poor and gradually people are moving towards him without any cash business.
Since demonetization ban, there has been considerable increase in different ways of digital payments.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
25 billion countrymen can resolve to do the work of 2.5 thousand crore digital transactions in this year
We have announced in the budget
We can do this in everyday life .
You do not imagine, but you can serve the country very big and you can become a brave soldier in the fight against black money and corruption.
Digidhan Mela has been organized for public education and public awareness in the past.
There is a resolution to do 100 programmes across the country
80-85 programs have been done
Therein was a reward .
Nearly twelve lakh people have received this reward from the consumer .
April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar
The Digi-Mela is going to conclude on the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
After a hundred days , the last is going to be a big event .
There is also a provision for a very big draw .
We should contribute to how cash is less, how the behavior of notes is less.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that every time I ask people for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, there are many suggestions.
But I have seen that every time there is an insistence on cleanliness .
A bitia named Gayatri from Dehradun, who is a student of 11th, has called me and sent a message: - Honourable Principal, Prime Minister, I salute you.
First of all congratulations to you that you have won by huge votes in this election
I want to talk to you about my mind
I want to say that people have to explain how important cleanliness is .
I go through the river every day in which people pour a lot of dust and pollut the rivers .
The river comes through the Rispna bridge and also comes to my house .
For this river , we went to the towns and took out a rally and interacted with the people , but there was no benefit .
I want to tell you that by sending one of your teams or through newspaper, this thing should be exposed, thank you.
Look, Brothers and sisters, how much pain is the daughter of the 11th class
How angry he is looking at the garbage in that river
I consider it a good sign .
This is what I want, in the minds of hundreds of millions of countrymen, there should be anger about dirt.
Once there will be anger, anger will arise, anger will arise, we will start doing something against dirt.
And it is good that Gayatri himself is expressing his anger, suggesting me, but at the same time he is also saying that he made a lot of efforts, but failed.
He has also taken the form of a movement
Hate towards filth is also increasing .
Be it awareness, active participation, movement, it has its own importance.
But hygiene is associated with more habits than the movement .
It's hard to work, but I have to do.
I am confident that in the new generation of the country, in the children, in the students, in the youth, the feelings that have been awakened by this indicates good results in itself.
Whatever Gayatri is listening to today's Mann Ki Baat, I will tell all the countrymen that the message of Gayatri should be a message for all of us.
My dear countrymen, since I am talking about Mann Ki Baat programme, I have been receiving several suggestions from the beginning and most people have expressed concern about the food waste.
Half of it is not filled in the stomach and then leaves it and leaves it there.
You have ever thought how much waste we do with what we leave these lips.
Have you ever thought that if you do not leave the lips, then how many poor people can fill the stomach.
This is not the subject that has to be explained.
However, when mother serves young children in our family, she says that the son, as much as you can eat, take as much as you can.
Some or the other endeavours continue to be made, but indifference on this subject is a social sedition.
Injustice to the poor
Secondly, if the savings are saved then the family also has economic benefits.
Think for the society, it is a good thing, but this topic is such that the family also has the benefits.
I am not urging on this topic, but I would like to increase this awareness.
In every state of India, you will get such people somewhere.
Their life can also inspire us not to combine.
We should take as much as we have food.
Look, this is the way for change.
And those who are aware about the health of the body always say - keep the stomach slightly empty, keep the plate slightly empty.
And when there is talk of health, the World Health Day on April 7 is the World Health Day.
The United Nations has set a target of health for all by 2030.
We are also familiar with the word expression, but if there is a meaningful meaning then some people also call it depression.
There is an estimate that more than 35 crore people in the world are mentally and suffering from expression.
The problem is that we do not understand this thing even around us and perhaps we hesitate to talk about it openly.
Those who feel expression themselves do not speak anything because they feel a little embarrassed.
I would like to tell the countrymen that there is no such expression that it cannot get rid of it.
A psychological environment is created and it starts.
The first mantra is the need for its expression instead of the supervision of expression.
Among your friends, among friends, among parents, among the brothers, with the Teacher, openly tell me what is happening to you
Sometimes children living in the hostel of loneliness become more painful.
Everyone in the house is going out somewhere, he says - no, I don't have to come today - I like to stay alone.
You have ever noticed why it does .
You must assume that it is the first step in the direction of expression.
If he does not like you to stay in the group, he is going alone in one corner, then try to see that it does not allow it to happen.
Give him an opportunity to stay in the middle with those who speak openly to him.
Inspire him for expression while speaking openly about laughing and joy and expelling what kind of fun has been found inside him.
This is the best way .
and expression becomes the cause of mental and physical diseases .
Just as diabetes becomes the host of all kinds of diseases, the expression also destroys all our capabilities to fight, to fight, to make decisions and to make decisions.
Your friends, your family, your campus, your environment - they can stop you from going to the expedition together and then you can get out.
There ' s another way II
Help your mind, share their happiness and sorrow, you see, the pain inside you will be erased.
If you try to understand their sorrows and serve them, you will have a new self-confidence.
By connecting with others, by serving someone and serving selflessly, you can make the burden of your mind light very easily.
Yoga is also a good way to keep your mind healthy.
Tension liberation, liberation from pressure, journey towards happy mind - Yoga helps very much.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
This will be the third year.
If there is any suggestion about the third International Day of Yoga in your mind, you must send your suggestions to me through my mobile application, guide me.
The songs and poetic compositions you can prepare in relation to Yoga should be done so that they can easily understand the people.
Today, I would like to talk to mothers and sisters because today there is a lot of discussion about health and health.
So in the past, the Government of India has made a major decision.
Our working class women in our country, our women in the working class and their numbers are increasing day and day, their participation is increasing and it is welcome but at the same time, women also have special responsibility.
The Government of India has taken a very big decision.
These working class women will be given 26 weeks at the time of delivery, at the time of delivery, at the time of delivery, at the time of delivery and at the time of delivery.
Perhaps there are two or three countries in the world, which are beyond us.
India has made a very important decision for our sisters.
And his original objective is to take care of the newborn, the future citizen of India, the right care of the mother in the early days of his birth, if he gets a lot of love, then these children will become the trust of the country by becoming bigger.
The health of mothers will also be good and therefore it is a very important decision.
And this will benefit about 18 lakh women working in the formal sector.
My dear countrymen, on 5th April is the holy festival of Ramnavami, on 9th April is Mahavir Jayanti, on 14th April is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
The life of all these great men continue to inspire us, give us the power to resolve for a New India.
After two days, Chaitra Shukla Pratipada, Year Pratipada, New Sanvatsar, I congratulate you all for this New Year.
This is the time for farmers to get the fruits of their hard work after the spring.
In different corners of our country, this New Year is celebrated in different forms.
In Maharashtra, as a new year in Gudi-Padwa, Andhra-Karnataka, Ugadi, Sindhi Chetti-Chand, Kashmiri Navreh, Sanvatsar Pooja in the area of Awadh, joined-sheetal in Mithila in Bihar and Satuwani festival in Magadh are held on New Year.
Innumerable, India is a country full of so many diversity.
Winter season is to go now
The season of spring has knocked us all in life .
After the fall, new leaves start coming in the trees
Flowers bloom
Gardens become green
The color of the birds feels like a heart .
Not only flowers, fruits also look bright in the sunlight on the branches of the tree.
The fruits of the summer start appearing in the spring of mango .
At the same time, the yellow flowers of mustard in the fields bind expectations to the farmers.
Tesu or palash ' s dry flower indicates the arrival of Holi .
Amir Khusro describes the moments of this change of weather .
The festival of Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi puts colors of happiness in human life
Love, brotherhood, in the environment of humanity, we are going to leave Falgun for the last month and are ready to welcome the new month Chaitra.
Indeed , you are the coincidence of these two months .
First of all, I express my gratitude to millions of citizens of the country that before Mann Ki Baat, when I ask for suggestions, there are many suggestions.
On the Narendra ModiApp, on Twitter, on Facebook, on Post, I am grateful to all for this.
And that is why he has said that I will give some information about the launch of 104 satellites and interceptor missions.
Shobha ji, I thank you very much that you remember the example of India's pride.
Whether it is to tackle poverty, escape from diseases, connect with the world, knowledge, information, technology, science have entered its place.
February 15, 2017 is a glorious day in India's life.
Our scientists have proudly raised Indias head in front of the world
The SER has successfully launched 104 satellites in different countries, including the US, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UAE and India, through the Mega Mission.
India became the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together into space
And it is also a matter of great happiness that this is the successful launch of the 38th PSU
There is a historic achievement for the SCR, but for the whole of India.
Brothers and sisters, It is a very important thing in these 104 satellites - Cartosat 2 - It is the satellite of India and it will help the photographs drawn through it, mapping of resources, infrastructure, estimation of development and planning of urban development.
In particular, my farmer brothers and sisters, how much water can be used in the country, how should it be used, how should it be kept in mind, this new satellite artosat will help us very much on all these topics.
Our satellite has sent some pictures as soon as it goes
He has started his work .
It is also a matter of happiness for us that the leadership of this campaign has been done by our young scientists, our women scientists.
Such a strong participation of youth and women is an important aspect of the success of ISR.
I convey my best wishes to the scientists of ISR on behalf of the countrymen.
For the general public, for the service of the nation, for the service of the nation, for the purpose of bringing space science, they have always been creating new records.
Congratulations to our scientists and their entire team are as low as we give.
Shobha ji has asked another question and that is about the security of India
India has achieved a great achievement about it.
This thing has not been discussed yet, but Shobha ji's attention has been taken on this important thing.
This mission with interception technology marked success by stacking the enemy's mission at a height of about 100 kilometers from the earth during its trial.
This is a very important achievement in the field of security
And you will be happy to know that there are only four or five countries in the world who have this greatness.
When we see new technologies, there is a new scientific achievement, we are happy to see people.
And curiosity has played an important role in the development journey of human life .
And those who have special intelligence talent do not allow curiosity to remain as curiosity, they also raise questions within it, find new curiosity, create new curiosity.
And the same curiosity becomes the reason for new discovery
They do not sit comfortably until they get the answer
And if we observe the development journey of thousands of years of human life, we can say that this development journey of human life is no longer complete.
Full break is impossible
The universe, the rules of creation, the effort to know the mind of man continues to continue.
New science, new technology is produced from it.
And every technology, the form of every new science, gives birth to a new age.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about the hard work of science and scientists, many times I have said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should be attracted to science.
The country needs a lot of scientists
Today ' s scientific is the reason for a sustainable change in the lives of generations to come .
In the past, NITI Aayog and the Ministry of External Affairs of India had planned a large united competition during the 14th Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
Social useful innovation was invited
Sometimes the problem also shows the importance of science for solutions .
The meaning of saying is that in society, people of this kind of role are very much in the country.
And our society is also becoming a technology driver.
Arrangements are driven by technology
In a way technology is becoming an integral part of our life.
Large force is visible on Digi-Dhan in the past
Gradually people are moving from cash to digital currency.
Digital transactions in India are also growing at a rapid pace.
In our country, Lucky Customer Scheme, Digi-Dhan Business Scheme have received huge support in the past.
It's almost two months since 15 thousand people get a reward of one thousand rupees per day
And it is a matter of happiness that so far, 10 lakh people have been rewarded under the Digi-Dhan Yojana, more than fifty thousand traders have been rewarded and more than 1.
More than 100 customers under this scheme are those who have received a reward of one lakh rupees.
There are more than four thousand traders who have received a reward of Rs. 50,000.
Be it farmers, traders, small entrepreneurs, professionals, domestic women, students, everyone is taking part in it and they are also getting benefits.
When I asked her analysis, "Brothers, see, only youngsters come here that people of adult age also come, I am glad that among those who receive prizes, there are 15 years old and there are also 15-75 years old.
Santosh ji from Mysore has written on the Narendra ModiApp that he got a record of Rs. 1,000 under Lucky Customer Scheme.
Now they run cars, but in a way they have become the Ambassador of this scheme.
All the travellers are given the knowledge of digital all the time.
They keep telling things with such enthusiasm and encourage others.
I would urge the countrymen, the youth of the country and the Lucky Customer Scheme either the Digi-Dhan Business Scheme - the reward they have received.
You lead this movement.
You should take this forward and in a way the fight against corruption and black money has a very important role in it.
Everyone associated with this work has a new Anti-Corruption Cadre in the country.
In a way, you are the soldiers of cleanliness.
You know that Lucky Customer Scheme - 100 days when completed.
On 14th April, the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is a celebration of the gathering.
On April 14, a very big pride of crores is going to be drawn.
There are about forty-five days left.
Remembering Babasaheb Ambedkar , can you do one thing
Now, the 125th birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar has gone.
This time Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary and CBI
I would like to say that Dr. Baba Saheb has laid the foundations to strengthen us.
Going home and connecting everyone to the BIM App to 125 crore hands.
For the last two-three months, the impact of this movement has been that many townships, several villages and many cities have achieved a lot of success.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has a huge contribution to the economy of our country.
The economic strength of the village gives strength to the economic pace of the country.
I want to tell you a very happy thing today.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have laboured hard and filled food stores.
In our country, the hard work of farmers has resulted in record food production this year.
All the signals are saying that our farmers have broken all the old records.
This time in the fields, crops have been so waved every day, like Pongal and Baisakhi have been celebrated today.
This year, more than two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
This is 8 more than the last record recorded in the name of our farmers.
So this is an unprecedented achievement in itself.
I specially want to thank the farmers of the country.
I am happy that the farmers of my country listened to the voices of the poor and cultivated various pulses on the earth about two hundred and ninety lakh hectares.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service of the poorest of my country by the farmers.
My farmer brothers and sisters are specially thankful for my prayer and my request to the farmers of my country for the way they worked hard on their heads and eyes and produced pulses.
My dear countrymen, it keeps going on in our country, by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organisations, by everybody, in this direction of cleanliness.
In a way, everybody is seen behaving awareness about cleanliness in some form.
Government is constantly making efforts.
In the past, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which is the Ministry of Water and Sanitation of our Government of India, under the leadership of our Secretary, a programme of senior officers of 23 State Governments was held in Telangana.
And in the Warangal State of Telangana, not just a seminar in the closed rooms, what is the importance of direct cleanliness, using it.
Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise organised in Hyderabad on 17-18 February
The toilet pits of six households were evacuated and the authorities themselves showed that the two pit toilets used can be used and used again.
He also showed how convenient toilets of this new technology are and there is no inconvenience in cleaning them, no hesitation, which is a psychological barrier, it does not stop.
And we also clean more commonly, we can clean a toilet pit.
And as a result of this effort, the media of the country has also promoted it very much, it has also given importance to it and it is natural that when an ICT is being developed.
If the ASO officer himself cleanses the toilet pit, then it is very natural to take care of the country.
And this is the cleaning of toilet pit and one of those whom you consider waste and waste but if you look at it in terms of fertilizer then it is a black gold.
We can see what happens from waste to health.
And it has been proved .
A standard two Pit toilet for a six-member family - this model is filled in about five years.
After this, the waste can be easily removed and redirected in the second pit.
In six to twelve months, the garbage deposited in the pit becomes completely decomposed.
It is very safe to handle decomposed waste and fertilizer very important fertilizer NPK
Farmers are well familiar with NPK.
Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium - This is full of nutrients and is considered to be the best fertilizer in the agriculture sector.
The way the government has taken these initiatives, others have also taken such initiatives.
And now Doordarshan has a special programme of sanitation news .
The more such things will be highlighted in it, the more it will benefit.
In the government, different departments celebrate Swachhta Pakhwada Regulations.
In the first fortnight of the month of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development along with the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and Ministry of Tribal Affairs are going to strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan.
And in the second fortnight of March, two other Ministries - Ministry of Shipping Shipping and Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation - these Ministries are also going to carry forward the last two weeks of March Swachhta Abhiyan.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does something good, the whole country experiences a new energy and increases confidence.
We all welcomed the performance that our Divyang sportspersons performed in Rio Parallimpics.
In the final of the Blind T-20 World Cup held this month, India defeated Pakistan for the second consecutive time and increased the pride of the country by becoming a world campaign.
I once again congratulate all the team players.
The country is proud of the achievement of these Divyang colleagues.
I always believe that Divyang brothers and sisters are powerful, determined, courageous and determined.
Every moment we can learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or space science - women of our country are not behind anyone
They are moving forward in their footsteps and illuminating the name of the country with their achievements .
In the last few days, the Asian Rugbi Sevens Trophy won our women silver medal.
My best wishes to all those players
World Women's Day Celebrates March 8
In India too, giving importance to daughters, increasing awareness about them in family and society, sensitivity increases
Beti Bachao Beti Teach this movement is moving forward at a rapid pace
Today it ' s not just a government program
This has become a campaign for social sensitivity and public education.
During the last two years, this programme has linked the general public, has forced people to think about this burning issue in every corner of the country and has changed the thinking of the people towards the old customs that have been going on for years.
When the news is received that the festival was celebrated on the birth of the daughter, so much joy comes
In a way , positive thinking towards daughters is becoming a cause for social acceptance .
I have heard that the Uddalore district of Tamil Nadu has banned child marriage under a special campaign.
So far, more than 175 child marriages have been stopped
District Administration has opened bank accounts of more than 55-60 thousand daughters under Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana
Under the Convergence Model in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, all the departments have been linked to the Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao scheme and efforts are being made by the district administration to adopt orphan girls and ensure their education.
A campaign is being run for the education of villages and household daughters under every household knock program in Madhya Pradesh.
Rajasthan has launched a campaign to inspire the girls who had been droped out by running their child, their school campaign to re-recruit them to school.
The meaning of saying is Beti Bachao Beti Padhao this movement has also taken many forms.
The entire movement has become a mass movement
New imaginations are associated with him
It has been turned as per local requirements .
You are also connected with activism
I get to know a lot from you.
What is going on on on earth, what is going on in the minds of the poor, the village reaches me
I am very grateful to you for your contribution
Yesterday, Shri Krishna Janma Mahotsav celebrated across India
Someone can imagine how personality will be that even after thousands of years, every festival comes with a new inspiration, brings in a new energy and thousands of years old life that can still give examples and inspiration to solve problems, everybody can find solutions to the present problems in the life of Shri Krishna.
Sometimes the task of picking up rocks, sometimes the task of picking up food leaf, that is, everything feels like a new one. And therefore, today, when I am talking to you, I, I, two Mohans, I remember.
One Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan, and the other Charkhadhar Mohan
Sudarshan Chakradhari Mohan, except the banks of Yamuna, went to the coast of the ocean in Gujarat, stabilised in the city of Dwarka and born on the coast of the ocean, came to the banks of Yamuna and breathed the last breath of life in Delhi.
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan had utilized his intellect, his duties, his ability and his thoughts in the situations of that time, even thousands of years ago, to avoid the war, to avoid the struggle and to tackle the war, and the Charkhadhar Mohan had also chosen such a way for freedom, to save human values, to save the basic elements of personality - this has given a form to the war of freedom that is wonderful for the whole world, even today is wonderful.
Be it the importance of selfless service, the importance of knowledge or the importance of smiling between all fluctuations in life, we can learn from the message of Lord Krishna and that is why we have also been known as Shri Krishna, Jagatguru.
Today, when we are discussing festivals, India is preparing for another big festival and it is not only India but also in the whole world.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He served the farmers who were being discriminated in Champaran, they served the mill workers who were not given proper wages, they considered the service of poor, destitute, weak and hungry people as the supreme duty of their lives.
Whoever, whenever he needs, Mahatma Gandhi was always present for the service.
He emphasized not only on service but also on self-confidence associated with it.
The meaning of the word ' Service ' is that it should be done with joy - service Paramo Dharma :
But, at the same time, excellent joy, self-reliant: The feeling of this feeling is also in service.
This is what we can understand from Bapu's life.
For Mahatma Gandhi, individual and society, humanity and humanity, this was all
Whether it is Phoeni Farm in Africa or Tolstoy Farm, Sabarmati Ashram or Wardha in everywhere, in a unique style, they have always been emphasizing on community mobility.
It has been my privilege that I have got the opportunity to visit several important places related to revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can say that Gandhi used to emphasize the organization and feeling of service.
Community Service and Community Mobilisation is the feeling that we have to bring into our practical life.
In the true sense, this is the true tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.
No countrymen
and community has its own strength .
This whole, in the programmes of Gandhi 150, there should be collection and service.
Our ladies are club
The work done by the ladies clubs of modern era will continue to do, but all the stakeholders of the ladies club will work together and work together.
can do a lot
To gather books, share the old, the poor, spread the knowledge and I believe that perhaps 130 crore countrymen have 130 crore imaginations and 130 crore undertakings.
There is no limit that comes in mind - be it goodwill, goodwill, goodwill and be it the service of complete dedication and that too is for the feeling of a unique joy.
My dear countrymen, a few months ago, I went to Dandi in Gujarat.
Salt Satyagraha, Dandi is a very important turning point in the freedom movement.
In Dandi, I had inaugurated a state-of-the-art Museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
The feelings arising from within your mind will be more powerful than any big literature composition and may be more powerful in today's times, in your eyes, in your eyes, in your pen, it may be more relevant to you.
Several programmes, competitions, exhibitions have also been planned in the coming days.
But one thing in this context is very interesting that I want to share with you .
Haripura Panels was particularly interesting in it .
You will remember that the Congress session was held in Haripura in Gujarat where the event of the Presidential Election of Subhash Chandra Bose is recorded in history.
These art panels have a very beautiful past
Before the Haripura session of Congress in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal Nand Lal Bose of Shanti Niketan Kala Bhawan
Gandhiji wanted to show the lifestyle of people living in India through art and showcase this art work during the session.
This is the Nand Lal Bose whose art work enhances the beauty of our Constitution .
gives a new identity to the Constitution
And his art work has made Nand Lal Bose immortal along with the Constitution .
Nand Lal Bose visited the village around Haripura and finally made some art canvas showing the lives of rural India.
There was tremendous discussion in this precious artist ' s office
Once again, with the best wishes of Gandhiji on his 150th birth anniversary, I hope that every Indian has a resolution.
For the country, for the society, for someone else, something should be done.
This will be Bapu's good, true, authentic work
The sons of Maa Bharati, you will remember that in the last few years, we have launched Swachhta Hi Seva Abhiyan for nearly two weeks before 2nd October.
This time it will start from September 11
During this time, we will leave our homes and pay tributes to Mahatma Gandhi through Shramdan.
Whether it is home or corridor, square or drains, schools, colleges to all public places have a great campaign of cleanliness.
In the same way, we have to finish the intrusion of single use plastic together.
This will save money and they will also be able to contribute to the protection of the environment .
This time on October 2, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, on this occasion, we will not only dedicate them to Open Defecation Free India but will lay the foundation stone of a new mass movement against plastic throughout the country.
Celebrate October 2 as Special Day
I also appeal to the corporate sector to come forward for proper disposal of plastic waste when all these wastes are collected.
This can be recycled
It can be made fuel
Thus , by this Diwali , we can also complete the safe disposal of this plastic waste .
My dear countrymen, our Sanskrit supposed to be the gems of knowledge in a way
Whatever we want in life can be found from it .
These days my contact has become very low but my contact was very much earlier .
Silly people call stones as gems
In our culture , food has been very glorified .
Until we have transformed the knowledge of food into science .
Balanced and nutritious food is essential for all of us, especially for women and newborns, because this is the foundation of the future of our society.
Under the Nutrition Mission, nutrition is being made a mass movement through modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting malnutrition in new and interesting ways
Sometimes one thing was brought in my mind
Inside the Nashik , paddy has become a big movement .
During the days of crop harvesting , Anganwadi servants collect a handful of grains from people .
This grain is used to make hot food for children and women.
The person donating it becomes a aware citizen social servant in a way .
After that he himself becomes dedicated to this goal and becomes a soldier of that movement.
All of us have heard about food processing in every corner of India in families .
These rites are done when the child starts feeding solid food for the first time .
Did not eat solid food
Gujarat thought in 2010 that on the occasion of food rituals, children should be given compulsory food so that people can be made aware about it.
This is a very great initiative that can be adopted, everywhere.
In many states people run date food campaigns
If there is a birthday in the family, a good day or a memory day, then the people of the family go to Anganwadi by making nutritious food and tasty food, they go to schools and the people of the family themselves serve children, feed them.
They also share their joy and rejoice in happiness .
There is a wonderful meeting of service and joy .
Friends, There are many small things that our country can fight an effective fight against malnutrition.
Today, in the absence of awareness, the poor and the rich, both families are affected by malnutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as Poshan Abhiyan across the country
You must join it, get information, get some new pairs you also contribute
If you bring a single person out of malnutrition , that is , we bring the country out of malnutrition .
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was sure that there will be a lot of questions about this issue and even so, and in the last few weeks, wherever I have met the people, the mention of the vs.
With this expedition, I have not only joined the youth from all over the world. I had never thought that the young hearts would become my place in this way.
I had never thought that the youth of our country and the world look at the diversity of things .
I had never thought that there would be an opportunity in my life to touch the hearts of the youth around the world .
And what happens
Just last week I went to Bhutan
I have seen that whenever I got the opportunity to visit as Prime Minister and because of the International Day of Yoga, the situation has become such that if I go to someone in the world then I do not ask me about Yoga for five or seven minutes.
There will hardly be a big leader in the world who has not discussed with me about Yoga and this is my experience in the whole world .
But these days a new experience is coming
Anything that is available, wherever you get the opportunity to talk, they discuss the issue of Village and discuss the development.
Tiger, ion, creature and I'm surprised how much people are interested
Discovery has planned to broadcast this program in 165 countries in their language .
I hope that in such a situation, this programme will help the world familiar with the message of India, the tradition of India, the sensitivity of nature in the ritual journey of India, and this expression of discovery channel will help the world very much. And now people want to know the steps taken towards climate justice and clean environment in our India.
But one more interesting thing is that some people also ask me one thing with hesitation that Modi ji tell me you were speaking Hindi and Bear Grills do not know Hindi then how was it happening between you so fast
Is this later updated
This has been so frequent shooting. What has happened
ask with great curiosity .
Look, there's no secret in it.
Reality is that a lot of technology was used in talks with Bear Grills.
So I used to speak Hindi but I used to hear it English and because of it the dialogue became very easy and this is the amazing thing of technology.
After this show, a large number of people have seen me discussing Jim Corbett, National Park.
You must also visit the places related to Natural and Wild Life Nature and Life.
I have said before, I must say that you must go North-East in your life.
will expand your inner
The country filled with diversity will also fill you with diversity as a teacher.
Last month, I got the opportunity to issue Tiger Census in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are there in India
The population of tigers in India is 2967
A few years ago half of it was too difficult to do
Tiger Summit was held in Russia's Saint Petersburg in 2010 regarding tigers
In this a resolution was taken expressing concern over the decreasing number of tigers in the world .
This resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by Twenty Twenty Twenty Twenty 2022
We doubled the number of Tigers in our country in 2019.
Not only the number of tigers in India but also the number of protected areas and community reserves has increased.
When I was releasing the data of tigers, I also remembered the lion of Gir in Gujarat.
When I took over the responsibility of the Chief Minister there, the habitat of lions was shrinking in the jungles of Gir.
their number was decreasing
We took several steps one after another in Gir .
In 2007, decided to deploy women guards there
Improves infrastructure to enhance tourism
Whenever we talk about nature and wildlife then only talk about conservation .
But, now we have to move ahead of conservation and think about compassion.
In our scriptures , there is also a good guidance in this subject .
Therefore, we need to not only conserve our forests, vegetations and wildlife but also create an environment that can produce properly .
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda ji on September 11, 1893.
This young sanyasi of India, who shaken the human race all over the world, left India's stunning identity in the world.
The slave that the world was looking towards India with a very deformed feeling was forced to change the views of the world towards India by the words of great men like 11 September 1893 Swami Vivekananda
Let's come, Swami Vivekananda ji had seen the form of India that Swami Vivekananda ji had to know the strength of India.
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that on August 29, the National Sports Day is celebrated.
This will be a big entertainment campaign for everybody, children, elderly, youth and women and it will be your own.
But I ' m not going to tell her nuances today .
I want to make you aware of DITNESS and set some goals together for the country for it India.
My dear countrymen, I will be waiting for you on August 29 at It India.
Let's go with a new zeal, a new resolution, a new power.
My dear countrymen, today we will meet so much in the matter of mind.
I'll wait for your suggestions,
Let us all come together to fulfil Gandhi's dreams to make India of the dreams of the freedom fighters.
Let the inner joy come out with service .
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all.
On January 26, our Republic Day was celebrated with zeal and enthusiasm in every corner of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, in a way this ritual festival is also a celebration that also makes future generations aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities.
However, in our country, the duties of the citizens and the rights of the citizens - the depth of debate that should be debated and the widespread discussions that should be discussed are not happening yet.
I hope that at every level, at every time, the more force is given on the rights, the more force is given on the duties.
On two tracks of rights and duties, the car of India's democracy can move forward at a fast pace.
Yesterday is January 30. Our revered Bapu is a virtuous date.
On January 30, we all pay homage to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country by keeping silence at 11 in the morning, 2 minutes.
As a society, as a country, on 30th January, at 11 o'clock, it should be a comfortable nature.
Why not be 2 minutes, but there is also a collectiveness, resolution and reverence to the martyrs.
In our country, there is a simple respect for the army and for the security forces.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers who were honored with various gallantry awards and their families.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Vishisht Seva Medal, many categories.
When we know deeply about their courage, valour and valour, we also get surprise and pride and inspiration.
On one hand, we were all happy with the news of the zeal and enthusiasm of January 26, at the same time, the soldiers of our army in Kashmir who are engaged in protecting the country have achieved heroism due to avalanches.
I respectfully pay homage to all these brave soldiers.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I continue to talk about my mind.
January, February, March, April - all these months take place in every family, in the criteria.
One-and-a-half of the children are healthy but the entire family is suppressed under the weight of Feam.
So I had decided that this is the right time that I should talk to students friends, talk to their innovators, talk to their teachers because for many years, where I went, where I got it, the examination was a big problem.
Family disturbed, student disturbed, teacher disturbed, a big strange psychological atmosphere looks at every household.
And I have always felt that I should come out of it and that is why I want to talk to young friends in detail today.
I got a telephone message of creation.
So I want to ask you so much that this atmosphere can't be pleasant
Well, the question has been asked by the creation, but this question will be in your mind.
The examination should be an opportunity of happiness in itself.
It has been a year-long hard work, now there has been an opportunity to tell that this festival should be a festival of enthusiasm.
There are very few people, for whom there is a place in the Feam and for most people the Feam is a preservation.
You have to decide that you will consider it as a presure.
Those who believe in the place will be able to regret those who believe in the pressure will regret.
And that is why I believe that the examination is a festival, take the examination as if it is a festival.
And when festivals take place, when festivals are held then the best among us comes out and comes out.
The feeling of society is also at the time of the festival.
This is the strength of the festival.
We should also have an atmosphere of festivals in the entire family, among friends and neighbourhoods.
You see, this will be converted to the pressure and place.
Festival atmosphere will make the burden free.
And I urge the parents to create an atmosphere of celebration for these three-four months.
The fact is that from Kanyakumari to Kashmir and from Kutch to Kamrup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, these three-four months exams are conducted.
It is the responsibility of all of us to change these three-four months every year in our own way, in our traditions and in the environment of our families.
And you must have seen that when you are happy and smile, you find yourself free and when you are ready, you can easily remember your years old things.
A year ago, what Teacher said in the classroom, the whole scene is remembered.
And you should know that the power to recall the memory is the highest in the relation.
If you are in tension, then all the doors are closed, don't go inside, don't come out inside.
There is a stoppage in the thought process, it becomes a burden in itself.
You were the ones, no one told them.
But who was inside, immediately came out and came out because you were ready.
And that is why if there is any medicine to recall memory then it is a relation.
And I tell myself that if there is a preservation, then we forget our things and are ready, we can never imagine, we suddenly remember such things, they are very useful.
But when there is tension then your knowledge, your knowledge, your information gets suppressed and your tension gets rid of it.
And therefore it is necessary that a happy mind is the sector for a good mark-shirt. Sometimes it feels that we cannot see the examination in proper perspective.
It seems that he is a question of life and death.
The feam you are going to give is the feam of what you have studied throughout the year.
This is not the criterion of your life.
What kind of life you live, what kind of life you want to live, what kind of life you want to live is not the same.
In your lives, in classrooms, innotebooks, there would have been an opportunity to pass through several tests.
And that is why the examination has to do something with the success and failure of life, get rid of such burden.
They went to the Air Force to be admitted.
Believe me, because of that failure, if he was disappointed and lost his life, would India not get such a big scientist and such a big president
The marks have become the most important.
Because of this, the competition has increased very much, as well as the tension among the students has also increased a lot.
So I would like to be aware of your ideas by taking this current direction of education and its future.
By the way, he has only responded, but Cha wants me to keep something in it.
Marks and marks-sheets are a limited use of it.
Nothing happens in life.
Life goes on how much knowledge you have earned.
Life goes on, have you tried to live what you have to go
Life goes on that what you have got a sense of mission and what is your sense of ambition, is there any synergy between your mission and ambition
If you believe in these things, the marks will come behind you by asking them and you will never need to run behind the marks.
In your life, your knowledge is going to work, skill is going to work, self-confidence is going to work.
You should tell me that there will be a doctor from your family and all the family members will go to him and they are family doctors.
If you go to a lawyer to fight a bigger case, do you see the marks-sheets of that lawyer
You see his experience, his knowledge and his journey of success.
And that is why the weight of this point also sometimes stops us from going in the right direction.
But this does not mean that I should say that just, it is not to read.
It needs to be used for its criterion.
I was yesterday, today I said, it's necessary to know.
But if you occus on the marks, you gradually shrink yourself and limit yourself to a certain area to get marks only.
So it may be that despite being promising in Feam, sometimes life fails.
Cha ji, one thing has also said that competition.
This is a very big psychological battle.
There is a feature of the lives of most successful players that they compete.
If we take the example of Mr. Sachin Tendulkar ji.
Twenty years continuously breaking their own records, defeating themselves every time and moving forward.
He has a wonderful life journey because he has adopted the path of competition more than competition.
Friends in every field of life and when you are going to give exams, if you were able to read for two hours beforehand, can you do it for three hours
From within, that energy is produced by itself.
If you are better then you will be careless, you will be filled with high confidence.
If you distress against it, then you will be sad and disappointed, filled with jealousy, the jealousy you, yourselves, and if equal, you will never feel the need for improvement.
How to do it before, how to do it, how to do it well, just focus on it.
You see, you will feel a lot of change.
S. Sundar ji has expressed his feelings about the role of parents.
They say that the role of parents in the examination is very important.
He further wrote that my mother was not read-written, yet she used to sit with me and asked me to solve the questions of math.
Once you will learn to take action, the maximum problem will end.
CACCEPTANCE opens the path to solve problems.
Expectations make the path difficult.
Acknowledgement of the situation gives an opportunity to open new paths and therefore accept what is there.
You will also be burden free.
One of our familiar people was in the hospital because of heart attack, and before the Lok Sabha of our India, speaker Ganesh Dada Mavalankar, his son Purushottam Mavalankar, had ever been an MP, he came to see his health.
I was present at that time and I saw that he did not come and asked a single question about his health.
As soon as they sat and came, they started listening quietly and in the first two-four minutes they made such an atmosphere light.
In a way, we go to a sick person like we scare of illness.
I would like to say to the parents, sometimes we do the same with the children.
Have you ever thought that in the days of Feam, you should give an atmosphere of laughter to the children.
You see, the atmosphere will change.
I have come to the phone call of a great amazing thing.
They do not want to tell gentlemen their name.
Listening to the phone you'll know why they don't want to tell their name
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I can't tell my name because I did something like this in my childhood.
I tried to duplicate once in my childhood and I started preparing a lot to find ways to duplicate how I could duplicate, because of which I wasted a lot of time.
In that time, I could bring the number as much as I spent in putting a mind to copy.
And when I tried to duplicate and pass, I was caught in it and because of me, many friends around me had a lot of trouble.
Your point is right.
These short-cut roads are the reasons for copying.
So the copy never benefits, to cheet.
Copy makes you bad, so don't copy.
You must have heard many times that do not copy, do not copy.
I'm telling you the same thing again.
And once there was a habit of copying, there would never be any desire to learn anything in life.
Then where will you reach
Whatever its entire creativity is, they eat in the ways of duplication and if you give the same creativity, this time on the issues of your health then perhaps there is no need for copy.
The consequences that will be achieved by your hard work, the confidence that will increase will be wonderful.
This basic perception is wrong, the root of the problem is the same.
If there is an integral development then there is a life outside the books and it is very large.
This is the time for him to learn to live.
Someone should say that I will complete all the examinations first, I will play later, I will do it later, it is impossible.
Have you ever thought that when all these things are in front, then come out for two moments and look at the sky, look at some trees and plants, lighten a little mind, you see, with a freshness, you will come back in your room and in your books.
Whatever you are doing, take a little break, get up and get out, go to kitchen, find something like yourself, get a biscuit of your choice then eat and smile a little.
Whether it is five minutes, but you give break.
You will feel that your work is becoming simple.
Everyone likes it or not, I do not know, but I have an experience.
There is no need to live in a room to take deep breath.
You can see that the body will be relaxed with oneself and the restlessness of the body will not be felt by you, it will relax the brain organs as much as you feel.
When I hold meetings in the elections, my voice sometimes sits.
So I came to meet a folk singer.
They came and asked me how many hours you sleep.
I said - Why brother, are you a doctor
No-no, say- This voice is related to your speeches and speeches at the time of elections.
If you take full sleep then your vocal card will get complete rest.
Now I had never thought of sleep and my speech and my voice, they gave me a herb.
So we really understand the importance of these things, you see, you will be beneficial.
But this does not mean that just keep sleeping, but some will say that the Prime Minister has said, now there is no need to wake up, sleep.
So do not do this, otherwise the people of your family will be angry with me.
And if your marks-sheets will come on the day you will not show them, I will see them.
So do not do this.
And that is why I will say that this is a very big medicine for keeping the mind, intellect and body conscious.
Well, young friends, you're preparing for the examination and I'm sitting in mind.
Maybe these things of today will also do the work of relating to you.
If you can do it, do not do it, otherwise it will also become a burden.
So, as I advise your parents not to be burdened, they also apply to me.
Make the criterion a festival to cross every criterion.
Then there will never be a criterion, criterion.
Go ahead with this mantra.
On this occasion, I thank all the officers and jawans of the Coast Guard for their service to the nation.
It is a matter of pride that the Coast Guard has made its place among the world's 4 largest Coast Guard with all its 126 Ships and 62 aircraft built in the country.
In order to protect the maritime boundaries and maritime environment of the country, the youngsters of the Coast Guard are also in adverse circumstances.
And very few people will know that in our country there are not only men in the East Guard but women are also playing their respective responsibilities on the shoulders and playing successfully.
Our women officers of the Coast Guard work in the form of pilots, servers and also take overcrates.
It is believed to be an opportunity to worship Vidya.
Not only this, there is also a festival of inspiration for the heroes.
My color is De Basanti Chola - this is the inspiration.
On the auspicious festival of this spring Panchami, my countrymen have a lot of greetings.
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, All India Radio is always filled with its imagination.
Since last month, he has started reciting the matter of mind in regional languages immediately after the completion of my mind.
It has got extensive approval.
People are writing letters from far and wide.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to join you.
My best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
However, in the newspapers, new people are being caught everyday, notes are being caught, raids are being carried out, good people are being caught. How is this possible
L.
Rahul played the innings of 199 runs, II Test Captain Virat Kohli, along with good batting, also gave good leadership.
Last month we were all enjoying Diwali
Like every year, this time on the occasion of Diwali, I once again went to the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the jawans.
I go every time, but the experience of this Diwali was something else.
It was dedicated to the soldiers of Diwali and dedicated to the security forces in a unique manner by the 1. 25 million countrymen of the country, its impact was expressed on the faces of every soldiers there.
They looked full of emotions and not only that, the best wishes and messages that the countrymen sent, the security forces of the country were involved in their happiness and were a wonderful response.
And people sent messengers only. Not so, they were associated with the mind.
Someone wrote poems, someone made pictures, someone made cartoons, someone made videos, i.e. not knowing every house became a checkpoint like soldiers.
With the contribution of all of you, with the imagination of the sentiments of the soldiers of the country, the feelings of the security forces of the country will be collected in this book.
A soldier of the army wrote to me - Prime Minister, Holi for the soldiers, Diwali happens on every border, every time they are immersed in the security of the country.
Yes, yet at the time of festivals, the home is remembered.
But tell the truth, this time it did not seem like this
It didn't happen that there was a festival and I'm not home
It felt as if we were also celebrating Diwali with 1. 25 billion Indians.
My dear countrymen, the feeling that has been awakened between the security forces of our country and the security forces in this environment, should it be confined to just a few occasions
I am happy with you that we should remember the soldiers of our country in some form or the other in the form of a society, as a society, as a nation, as a nation, whether it is a festival or a festival or an atmosphere of happiness.
When the entire nation stands with the army, the strength of the army increases 125 million
Some time ago I had come to meet all the heads of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir.
I got the opportunity to talk to them for a long time .
He had brought some things about the development of his village, had come with some demands, but when there was a period of talk, it was natural, the situation of the valley, the law and order, the future of the children, all these things were very natural.
And so lovingly, so openly, these heads of the village spoke, everything was going to touch my heart.
I had urged them to go and focus on the future of these children.
Today, I am glad that all these Prime Ministers from the Kashmir Valley have fulfilled the promise I had made.
We went to the village and awakened all the people away .
Just a few days ago, when the board was executed, the sons and daughters of Kashmir took part in the board examination by the students of about 95, 50 percent of Kashmir.
The inclusion of such a large number of students in the board exams indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to achieving new heights of development for a bright future, through education.
I congratulate the students for their enthusiasm, but I congratulate their parents, their families, their teachers and all the village heads with a lot of congratulations.
Brothers and sisters, This time when I asked people for suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I can say that on the one hand all suggestions have come.
Everyone said that talk about 500- and 1000-notes more in detail
However, while addressing the name of the nation on 8th November, at 8 pm, I had discussed the launch of a great campaign to improve the country.
Even when I had made this decision before you, I had told everyone that the decision is not normal, it is full of difficulties.
But the more important the decision is to implement that decision
And I was also supposed to have to face many new difficulties in our normal life .
And even then I had said that the decision is so big, it will take 50 days to get out of its impact and then we will be able to move towards the normal stage.
The diseases we have suffered for 70 years cannot be simplify the liberation campaign .
I can understand your difficulties well.
But when I see your support, I see your cooperation
Despite a lot of efforts are being made to mislead you, even though sometimes events that distract the mind, you have well understood this path of truth, you have well accepted this thing of the country.
Five hundred and thousand notes and such a big country, a lot of currency, billions of notes and these decisions - the whole world is looking very well, every economist is analysing it, evaluating it.
The whole world is looking at the fact that the 125 crore Indians of India will achieve success by facing difficulties
Perhaps there can be a question mark in the mind of the world
India is only a reverence to the 1. 25 billion Indians, it is a belief that 1. 25 billion Indians will continue to fulfill their resolve.
And our country will come out with all kinds of penance like gold and its reason is the citizen of this country. You are the reason for this success.
All the units of central government, state government, local Swaraj institutions, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bank employees, more than one and a half lakh post offices, more than one lakh bank friends are engaged in this work day and night.
In the midst of the tension, all these people are working very calmly as a yagna of the country and service and as an attempt to make a great change.
Let's start in the morning, when the night will be completed, it's not even known, but all are doing
And the reason for that is that India will succeed in it is clearly visible.
And I have seen that all the people of the bank, the post office are working in such difficulties.
And when the matter of humanity comes , they see two steps ahead .
Someone told me that an old man in Khandwa became accident
Suddenly money was needed
There came to the notice of the local bank employee and I was glad to know that he had gone to his house and that old man to get the money so that he could be helped in treatment.
Such countless stories appear every day in TV, in media, in newspapers, in conversations.
Their ability came to know .
Today, once again, he has taken that challenge and I am confident that the resolution of 1. 25 billion Indians, the collective mankind will push this nation by making it a new force.
But evils are so spread that even today some people do not get habit of evils .
Some people still feel that these money of corruption, these black money, these uninterrupted money, these anonymous money, some way to find the way back to the system.
They're looking for unlawful ways to save their money.
The sad thing is that in this he also liked to choose the way to use the poor .
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, by talking about greed or temptation, by putting money in their accounts or doing some work from them.
But, don't play with the lives of the poor by mercy.
You shouldn't do anything that the name of the poor should come to the record and when the investigation is done later, my dear poor will get into trouble due to your sins.
And there is so harsh law of anonymous property, which is being implemented in it, how difficult it will be
And the government does not want our countrymen to face any difficulty
Any Mr. Ashish from Madhya Pradesh has made me a telephone fight against corruption and black money through this five hundred and thousand: - Sar Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare
I am a common citizen of Village Tirali, Tehsil Tirali, District Harda, Madhya Pradesh.
It is very commendable that the notes of thousands and five hundred notes have been closed by you.
Similarly, I have come from Mr. Yelappa Velankar ji of Karnataka: - Modi ji Namaste, I am talking to Yelappa Velankar from this village of Koppal District of Karnataka.
I want to thank you from my heart, because you said that good days will come, but no one thought that you would take such a big step.
Five hundred and thousand notes, seeing all these, taught black money and lessons to corrupt people
Every citizen of India will never have a good day .
I want to thank you for this .
Some things can be learned through media, through people and through government sources, the enthusiasm of working also increases a lot.
It is so joyful and so proud that what is the wonderful potential of the common man in my country
And people go there, eat food and after 2-4-6 days when they pass there again, they return the money again.
This is the strength of my country, which has service, sacrifice and authenticity.
But I don't know that in the discussion on tea, there is also a marriage.
I came to know that in Surat on November 17, a marriage took place with a discussion on tea.
In Gujarat, a daughter in Surat gave only tea to those who came to her marriage and did not give any tea or any food program - because there was some difficulty due to the ban on bondage.
Baratis also considered him the same honor
Bharat Maru and Daksha Parmar of Surat - they have contributed in the fight against corruption and black money through their marriage, it is inspiring in themselves.
I also bless the newly married Bharat and Daksha and congratulate myself for changing the occasion of marriage into this great sacrifice and turning it into a new opportunity.
Tea workers live and tea workers get money weekly
Now the note of 2000 rupees was found, then what did they do
Four neighbouring women gathered together and four bought and paid a note of Rs. 2000, they did not need a small currency, because the four bought and decided that they would get the next week, then we would take account of it.
People are looking for ways themselves
See, how is the change in the life of the village
Some people of this campaign have got immediate benefits
The country will get the benefit in the coming days, but some people have got immediate benefits.
Every municipality comes hardly 50 of the tax
But this time , due to this decision of 8th , all people ran to deposit their old notes .
In 47 urban units last year, there was a tax of about three and a half thousand crore rupees.
You will be surprised to know that you will also be happy - in this week they have deposited 13 thousand crore rupees.
Said three and a half thousand and said 13 thousand
And that too came from the front
Now this money has come up four times in that municipality, it is natural that there will be arrangements for poultry in the poor settlements, water will be arranged and anganwadi will be arranged.
There are many examples in which its direct benefits are also visible .
Brothers and sisters, Our villages and our farmers are a strong axis of the economy of our country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economy, between difficulties, every citizen is adjusting himself.
But I would like to specially congratulate the farmers of my country today.
Now I was taking statistics of sowing this crop .
I am glad whether wheat or pulses or oilseeds or till the 20th of November, sowing has increased considerablely compared to the previous year.
In the midst of difficulties, the farmer has searched for ways.
Government has also taken several important decisions in which farmers and villages have been given priority.
There are difficulties even after that, but I am confident that the farmer who is suffering from every difficulty and natural difficulties, always stands steadfast and stands steadfast.
Small businessmen of our country, they also provide employment and also increase economic activity.
Millions of rupees have been given to such small people from the money scheme because these small businesses, millions of people do and speed up the business of billions of rupees.
But due to this decision it was natural to have difficulty too .
But I have seen that now our small businessmen are also serving customers through technology, through mobile apps, through mobile bank, through credit cards, through their own ways and on the basis of confidence.
And I want to tell my small businessmen brothers and sisters that there is a chance, you should also enter the digital world.
Download the App of banks on your mobile phone
You also keep PSL machine for Credit Card
I invite you that you can contribute a lot in making a cashless society, you can create a whole banking system on your business and mobile phone and today there are many ways except notes that we can run business.
There are technological paths, safe, secure and quick
I would like you to only help in making this campaign a success. Not only this, you should also lead the change and I believe you can lead the change.
I also want to tell the labour brothers and sisters that you have been exploited.
There is a lease on the paper and when it is given in hand then it is another .
Sometimes the salary gets complete, somebody stands outside, he has to cut and the labour force makes this exploitation a part of life.
With this new system, we want your bank accounts and your salary money to be deposited in your bank so that there is a follow-up of Minimum Wags.
And once the money has come to your bank account, you too are not required to buy a small mobile phone or a big smart phone. Nowadays your mobile phone also works as an e-butway. You can also pay the money from the same mobile phone to the small neighbourhood shop.
Therefore, I urge the labour brothers and sisters to become a partner in this scheme because I finally have taken such a big decision for the poor of the country, for the farmers, for the labourers, for the deprived, for the deprived, for the victims and for the victims.
Today I specially want to talk to young friends
We say in the world that India is a country that has 65 population, below 35 years of age
You young and young women of my country, I know my decision has come to you.
I also know that you support this decision
I also know that you also contribute very much to pursue this thing positively .
But friends, you are my true soldier, you are my true companion
We have had a wonderful opportunity to serve Maa Bharati. We have got the opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
My young men, can you help me
Give me along, it's not going to be so much.
The experience of today's world is not the older generation.
Perhaps the elder brother in your family will not even know and even parents, uncles, maternal uncles and maternal uncles will not be aware.
You know what the app is, you know what happens online banking is, you know how online ticket booking happens.
Items are very common for you and you also use
But today the great work that the country wants to do is our dream.
It's fine that 100 percent cashless society is not possible.
And I need your physical help in this, I need a time for you, I need a solemn resolve and you will never disappoint me, I am sure because we are all those who wish to change the lives of the poor of India.
You know how many opportunities are available today for cashless society, for digital banking or mobile banking.
Each bank provides online facility
Wallet's simple meaning e-butua
Several types of cards are available
Ordinary food phone can also be a wash transporter
Whether it is a dhobi, a vegetable seller, a milk seller, a newspaper seller, a tea seller, a gram seller, everyone can use it comfortably.
And I have also emphasized upon making this system more easier .
All banks are engaged on this, are doing
My young friends, even after all this, there is a whole generation that is unaware of it.
And all of you, I know well, are active in this great work.
The kind of creative messages you give on WhatsApp - Slogans, poems, stories, cartoons, new imaginations, laughter and joke - I see everything and the creative power of our younger generation among the challenges, it seems as if it is the specialty of the land of India that at some time the Gita was born in the battlefield, today we are passing through such a big change.
But my dear young friends, I once again say, I need your help in this work.
G-G, I repeat, I need your help and you, I am confident that millions of youngsters of my country will do this work.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business
You voluntarily have to lead this campaign to bring out these notes, the campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to get rid of black money, the campaign to free people from difficulties and problems.
Once you will teach people how to use the Rupay Card, the poor will bless you.
If you teach these arrangements to the ordinary citizen then he will probably get rid of all the concerns and if this work takes place to all the young people of India, I don't believe that it will take more time.
Within a month, we can stand in the world as a new modern India and you can do this through your mobile phone, you can go to 10 houses everyday and add 10 houses everyday.
This country has made a big revolution
My youngsters, I once again, once again with a great urgency, I would like to tell you to take this campaign forward.
You must have seen that Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this century, is moving ahead with the campaign for cleanliness.
It seems that the subject of sanitation has spread in their colonies and only then on the birth anniversary of his father, he remembered the work of sanitation.
He has written that Harivanshray ji has a poem and he has written a line of soil, the mind of fun, life for a moment, my introduction.
Harivansh Rai ji used to introduce himself through this.
My introduction to the soil, the mind of fun, the life of a moment, and his son, Mr. Amitabh ji, who is running the mission of cleanliness in his rugs, he has written to me by using the poem of Harivansh Rai ji - Swachh Tan, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, My introduction.
I respectfully bow down to Harivansh Rai ji
I also thank Mr Amitabh ji for joining Mann Ki Baat in such a way and for pursuing the work of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, now your thoughts and feelings through Mann Ki Baat keep me constantly connecting you to MyGov and Narendra ModiApp through your letters.
Now it is a matter of mind at 11 o'clock, but in regional languages it is going to start immediately after completing it.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all on Diwali.
Deepawali festival is celebrated with enthusiasm and enthusiasm in every corner of India.
India is such a country that for 365 days, in some corner of the country, there are some festivals.
The people from afar will sometimes feel that such as the Indian public life, this is the second name of the festival and it is also natural.
The festivals that have been traditional in India since the Vedas have been the festivals of time-conditional change, we have seen the courage to end the tradition of external festivals and changes in festivals have also been accepted in accordance with the demand of time and society.
However, we can see one thing very well that this entire journey of India's festivals, its depth, its penetration in the people and its penetration in the people is linked to one original mantra.
Be it an extension of individual and personality, an attempt to expand the scope of our limited thinking from society to the universe and do it through festivals.
All these things, our ancestors have accumulated in a big scientific way and in a celebration.
Today the whole world discusses environment.
Nature-destruction is a matter of concern.
The festival of India is going to commemorate the tradition of nature and love, from child to every person.
Whether it is trees, plants, rivers, animals, mountains, birds, everybody's responsibility has been a celebration.
Nowadays, we observe the holiday of Sunday, but those who are the older generation, the labourer, the fishermen, you must have seen our tradition for centuries to celebrate Purnima and Amavasya.
That is, till now, the tradition of celebrating our holidays with the universe and science had developed.
Today, when we celebrate Diwali, as I said, every festival is an academic and brings the sense of education.
This festival of Deepawali gives a message to Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamaya - from darkness to light.
By burning the lamp of Deepawali, the darkness of the society, the darkness of the person, the darkness of the person, freedom from the darkness and the same is the festival of light by burning the lamp of Diwali.
One thing we all know very well, go to any corner of India, go to the house of Amir-se-Amir, go to the poorest of the poor hut, go to the hut of the poor, in the festival of Diwali, in every family the cleanliness campaign is going on.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
If the poor will have their soil utensils, then the utensils of the soil also clean up like this is just Diwali.
Diwali is also a cleanliness campaign.
However, there is a need of time that not just cleanliness in the house, cleanliness of the entire campus, cleanliness of the entire village, cleanliness of the entire village, we have to expand this nature and tradition.
The festival of Deepawali is no longer limited to the borders of India.
In all the countries of the world, the festival of Deepawali is remembered and celebrated in some form.
Several governments of the world are also becoming part of the festival of Deepawali.
He has put a picture on the institute and has shared that picture with the world and has done it with great pride.
And what's the picture.
16 women MPs of the Satapore Parliament are standing outside the Parliament by wearing Indian saris and these photographs have been viral.
And all this has been done on Diwali.
The Prime Minister of New ealand had just come here, he said to me that I have to go back soon because I have to attend the Diwali celebrations there.
I mean to say that Deepawali, this festival of light is becoming an inspiration for bringing the world community from darkness to light.
Together many firecrackers invite a very big absurdity to try to make big voices.
Never minds what things are around, there will be no fire anywhere.
In the days of Deepawali, news of accidents, fire news, news of death, big concerns.
And there is also a problem that in the days of Diwali, doctors have gone to celebrate Diwali with their families in large numbers, then there is another crisis in the crisis.
It's not just one day.
Say Govardhan Pooja, say Bhai Duj, say the benefit Panchami, and take it to the light festival of Kartik Purnima, in a way a long period runs.
At the same time, we also celebrate Diwali festival and also prepare for Chhath-Puja.
Chhath-Puja festival is a big festival in the eastern region of India.
In a way there is a great festival, it runs for four days, but it has a specialty - gives a very deep message to the society.
But the saying is that brother, people in the world worship the rising sun.
Chhath-Puja is a festival in which the sun is also worshiped.
There is a very big social message in it .
I would like to talk about the festival of Deepawali, talk about Chhath-Puja - this is the time to convey my best wishes to all of you but it is time for me to thank the countrymen, especially the countrymen.
For the last few months, the events that have been shaping, the soldiers of our army are looting everything for our happiness and happiness.
My feelings and feelings remain shadowed on the soldiers of the army, the soldiers of the security forces, these sacrifices, penances, hard work and my heart.
And one of the same thing had been done in mind that it should be dedicated to the name of Diwali security forces.
I invited the countrymen to Sandesh to Soldiers for a campaign.
But today I want to bow down to my head and say that there will be no such person in India, in whose heart there is immense love for the soldiers of the country, there is pride for the army, there is pride for the security forces.
The way he has been expressed, it is going to give strength to every countrymen.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the security forces. Your message has emerged as a strong man.
Be it schools, colleges, students, villages, poor people, traders, shopkeepers, politicians, players, cinematics, hardly anybody will be left out, who has not given it to the soldiers of the country, has not given a message to the soldiers of the country.
The media also reversed the Deepotsav to express gratitude to the Army and why not, whether it is BSF, ROP, IDF, IDF and IDF.
Whether it is the Indo-Tibetan Police, the Assam Riles, the Army, the Army, the Navy, the Coast Guard, I cannot speak the names of all.
When we are in the mood of the festival, remember it at the same time, there is a new strength in that memory too.
The strength increases in a message and the country showed tax.
I really express my gratitude to the countrymen.
Many, who had art, did through art.
Sandesh to Soldiers have come up with such a lot of things on this ashtag in a symbolic way.
I have sent a poem by Mr. Ashwini Kumar Chauhan, I would like to read it.
Ashwini ji has written - I celebrate festivals, smiles, smiles, smiles, smiles, smiles, smiles, smiles, all this is because you are, you are all this, I tell you today, the reason for my freedom is you, the goodness of happiness, I sleep comfortably because I sleep because you are stationed on the border, you bent on the border, you bent on the border, Ambur and India's Chaman you, the Shish bowing Mountain Ambur and India's Chaman you, the army is also mine.
My dear countrymen, whose mother-in-law is full of army personnel and whose in-laws are full of soldiers, a sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Come, let's hear what the army family says: - Namaskar Prime Minister, I am speaking Shivani Mohan.
The Sandesh to Soldiers campaign on this Deepawali is encouraging our armed brothers.
I'm from a army family.
My husband is also Army Officer.
My mother and mother-in-law, both have been army officers.
So we are full of entire family soldiers and there are many officers on the border who are getting such good messages and are getting a lot of incentives in the Army Circle.
And I would like to say that along with army officers and soldiers, their families and their wives also perform a lot of sacrifices.
Thank you. My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the army are found standing on every front of life not just on the border.
You must have heard that Himachal Pradesh was free from defecation in the open.
Earlier Sikkim had been provinced, now Himachal was also there, Kerala is going to be on 1st November.
The youngster of TBP, Shri Vikas Thakur, is originally from a small village in Sirmaur district of Himachal.
So in the village he was probably going to be a village meeting at that time, he reached there and was being discussed in the village meeting, construction of toilets and it was found that some families were unable to build toilets due to lack of money.
This development is a patriotic patriot of ours.
Only then came the power to refresh the Himachal Pradesh Pen Execution.
Similarly, in Kerala, I really want to express my gratitude to the youth.
I came to mind that in the far-flung forests of Kerala, where there is no road, it can hardly reach that village after walking on foot throughout the day, such a tribal panchayat Idmalakudi is also very difficult to reach.
People never go.
Nearby, in the urban areas, the students of engineering came to know that toilets are being constructed in this village.
NCC cadets, NSS students, engineering students, all together decided to build toilets.
The goods that were to be taken to make toilets, bricks, cements, all the goods that these youngsters picked up on their shoulders and went to those jungles walking on foot throughout the day.
Work is going on at a rapid pace in all the states.
I have mentioned something.
The way he has taken up this work, the entire state, I am confident that soon the Kerosene will be free.
How big change will come, theft will also stop, the benefits of the environment will also be there, our Foreign Exchange will also be saved and the convenience of the people will also increase.
Yes, there will be trouble, then the middlemen will be, the dishonest will be.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always a guide for all of us.
Everything of them should still be said to the country, how to go, sets standards for it.
Based on this standard, you decide.
The demand for time is that we have to address the aspirations of the poor of the country.
To get rid of difficulties, we will have to take one step after another.
Whatever our old thinking should be, but the society will have to free from the distinction of son and daughter.
Now there are toilets for girls in schools and toilets for children too.
This is an opportunity for our daughters to feel discrimination-free India.
Though immunization is done by the government, millions of children are left out of vaccination and become victims of disease.
Mission Indradhanush is a campaign of vaccination, which is also engaged in integrating the left-off children, which enables children to get rid of serious diseases.
After so many years of independence, the poor mother cooked food on a wooden stove and took 400 cigarettes of smoke in her body, what will happen to her health
Efforts are being made to provide smoke free lives to 5 crore families and are moving towards success.
Small businessman, small businessman, vegetable seller, milk seller, candle shopkeeper, moneylenders used to be faded in the interest of the moneylenders.
Mudra Yojana, Stand Up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account, this is a successful campaign for liberation of interesters.
Direct deposit of money to banks through Aadhar and the beneficiary get the money directly.
This is an opportunity to liberate middlemen in the lives of the common man.
There is a campaign in which there is no improvement and change, there is a path to salvation from the problem and freedom.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, the great men of this country - the unity of India who made the mantra of their lives - the festival of the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
But the phone of a gentleman from Punjab, his pain, also touched me: - Prime Minister, Namaskar, Sir, I am speaking Jasdeep from Punjab.
Sir, as you know that on 31st, Sardar Patel ji's birthday.
And as we all know how events were held in the country after his assassination.
Sir, I wanted to say that how can we stop such unfortunate events and events
My dear countrymen, this pain is not of a person.
A Sardar, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, history is a witness to the fact that after Chanakya, Bhagirath worked to unite the country, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Successful efforts to bring free India under a flag, such a great Bhagirath work, the great man who did it, bowed down to that great man.
But it is also painful that Sardar Saheb lives for unity, due to his priority of unity, many were also victims of anger, but never left the path of unity.
On the birthday of that great man who lives for unity and on the birthday of Sardar, wrong with Sardars, a page of history pains all of us.
However, in the midst of these difficulties, we have to move ahead with the mantra of unity.
This is the strength of the country in diversity.
We also avoid scattered thinking, scattered tendency, save the country.
Sardar Saheb gave us an India, the responsibility of all of us is to make the best India.
The original mantra of unity is the strong foundation of Shreshtha Bharat.
Sardar Saheb's life journey started with the struggle of farmers.
The son of the farmer was.
Sardar Saheb has played a very important role in delivering the freedom movement to the farmers.
It was Sardar Saheb's successful endeavour to make the freedom movement a force in the village and his organization was the result of power and skill.
But Sardar Saheb was just a person of struggle, not that, he was also a person of structure.
Today, sometimes many of us listen to Amul's name.
Today people are familiar with every product of Amul outside India and India.
But very few people would know that Sardar Saheb's divine vision was that he had imagined the unit of co-operative milk producers.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of light festival in this series of Diwali.
Guru Nanak Dev, his teachings and teachings are guiding not only for India but for the entire humanity.
Service, truth and Sarbat Da Bhala, this was the message of Guru Nanak Dev.
Peace, unity and goodwill was the original mantra.
Be it discrimination, superstition, evils, the campaign to liberate the society was only in every matter of Guru Nanak Dev.
When we were at the peak of the untouchable, caste-regime, its deformity, then Guru Nanak Dev chose Bhai Lalo as his associate.
Let us also, Guru Nanak Dev, who has given us the light of knowledge, who inspires us to leave discrimination, orders us to do something against discrimination, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, if we have to go ahead with this mantra then who can be our guide better than Guru Nanak Dev.
I also bow down to Guru Nanak Dev, when this light festival is coming.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you all on Diwali and Diwali in the name of the soldiers of the country.
Your dreams and your resolves should be successful in every way.
I convey my best wishes to you all for your life to be a life of happiness and happiness.
Thank you very much.
In the past, in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir, in a terrorist attack, we lost 18 brave sons of our country.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
And that is why I will say this to the countrymen today and I would like to repeat what I had said on the same day that I would like to repeat it again that I would be punished by being punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in our army.
We're desperate to our army.
Today I want to talk to the citizens of Kashmir specially.
The citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the anti-national forces well.
And as soon as they have started understanding the truth, they have moved on the path of peace by separating themselves from such elements.
Every parents wish that the school-college work completely as soon as possible.
The farmers also feel that the crops and fruits that have been prepared should reach the markets across the country.
Economic business also run properly.
And for the past few days, business has started smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and goodwill are also the way to solve our problems, the way for our progress is also the way for our development.
For our future generations, we have to cross new heights of development.
I am confident that we will find solutions to every problem together, find ways and pave the way for the future generation of Kashmir.
Security of the citizens of Kashmir, it is the responsibility of governance.
To make laws and orders, the government has to take some steps.
Sometimes people who think different from what we think of, also keep new ideas.
These days I get the opportunity to know a lot in social media.
From every corner of India, the feelings of all kinds of people get an opportunity to know and understand and it boosts the strength of democracy.
In the past, a young man named Harshvardhan of 11th grade kept a different kind of idea in front of me.
He has written that after the Uri terrorist attack, I was very disturbed.
But there was no way to do and what a small student like me can do.
So I came to my mind how to work for the country.
And I pledged that I will study for more than 3 hours every day.
I will be able to work for the country, become such a eligible citizen.
Brother Harsh Vardhan, at such a young age in this atmosphere of resentment, you can think healthyly, this is a matter of great happiness for me.
But Harsh Vardhan, I will also say that the resentment in the minds of the citizens of the country is a huge value.
This is a symbol of the consciousness of the nation.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had made a great effort to touch this emotional world of the country in a very best way.
And he inspired the common man of the country to work for the country by giving Jai Jawan - Jai Kisan Mantra.
There is another way for every citizen to express patriotism among the voices of bombs and guns. This was presented by Lal Bahadur Shastri.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to run the freedom movement, when the movement was intensified and there was a need for a halt in the movement, he used to use the intensity of the movement to motivate the intensity of creative work in the society.
All of us - the army should play its responsibility, the people sitting in the government should do their duty and with the responsibility of our countrymen, every citizen, this patriotism, if we also contribute to any creative contribution then the country will certainly cross new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T. S. Karthik wrote to me on the Narendra ModiApp that the athletes that had gone in the Parallimpics created history and their performance is the victory of human spirit.
Varun Vishwanathan also wrote on the Narendra Modi App that our athletes have done a very good job and you should mention it in Mann Ki Baat.
Not two of you, every person in the country has had an emotional attack on our sportspersons in Parallimpics.
Perhaps more than sports, this paralympics and the performance of our sportspersons have completely changed the vision of humanity and the vision of looking at Divyang.
And I will never forget this thing of our winner sister Deepa Malik.
When he received medal, he said that I have defeated disability by this medal.
There is a lot of strength in this sentence.
This time in Parallimpics, 19 thlets including 3 women from our country participated.
When Divya plays compared to the rest of the sports, physical capacity, skill of sports, this is the biggest thing - will power, will power.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won 4 medals by performing the best so far - 2 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze medal.
Bhai Devendra Jhajria, who received the Gold Medal, brought the Gold Medal again in the throwing of Bhala and brought it again after 12 years.
And they were not disabled from birth.
He had to lose one hand because of the electric current.
You should imagine that the person who receives the first world medal at the age of 23 and gets the second world medal at the age of 35 would have done so much in his life.
Mariyappan won a gold medal in Thangavelu High Jump.
And Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of just 5.
Poverty also did not come under the guise of their resolve.
They are neither residents of a big city nor are they from the middle class rich family.
Despite passing through a difficult life at the age of 21, despite physical difficulties, he gave medals to the country with the power of resolution.
In the name of Athlete Deepa Malik, many varieties of victories have been associated with his name.
Varun C. Bhati won a bronze medal in high jump.
These medals have done a lot to look at the medals and medals of paralysis in our country, in our society, in our neighbourhood and in our neighbourhood, in order to look at the disabled brothers and sisters.
Our sensitivities have been awakened, but the approach to look at these disabled persons has also changed.
Very few people will be aware of how the persons with disabilities have done this in the paralysis of this time.
Just a few days ago, there was a lympics competition in the same place.
Someone can imagine that the records of General Cympics were broken and broken by Divyangjans.
This time has happened.
Abdelatti Baka of Algeria made a new record of 1500 meters in the lympics competition of 1500 meters in the race of 1500 meters.
Not only this, I was surprised that the fourth of the persons with disabilities who did not get any medal as a driver was run in less time than those who received the Gold Medal in the general runners.
Once again, I congratulate all these sportspersons and in the coming days, India is moving forward towards making a smooth plan for Parallimpics and for its development.
My dear countrymen, last week I had several wonderful experiences in Navsari, Gujarat.
He also told me some part, and I presented it to the people there and people were surprised.
On that day, I got the opportunity to inaugurate a book and collected successful stories of the lives of some Divyangjans.
There were big inspirational incidents.
The Government of India recorded a world record on Navsari's land, which I consider to be important.
Within eight hours, six-two disabled persons who could not hear were successfully used to feed machines to listen to them.
He got a place in the Guinness Book of World Record.
It is a matter of pride for our countrymen to have three-three world records by Divyangs in the same day.
My dear countrymen, two years ago, on October 2, we started the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of revered Bapu.
And on that day also I had said that cleanliness should become a habit, every citizen should become a duty, an atmosphere of hatred towards dirt.
Now, when two years are taking place on October 2, I can say with confidence that awareness about cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 1. 25 billion people of the country.
And I had said that one step towards cleanliness and today we can all say that everyone has tried to move forward one step.
Meaning that the country has moved towards cleanliness, 100 million steps.
This has also been confirmed, the direction is correct, the fruits are good, what happens with a little effort, it has also been seen and therefore, everybody be it ordinary citizen, whether the government offices or the roads, whether the bus stations or railways, whether the school or colleges, religious places or hospitals, from children to old people, the poor, the farmer women, everyone is contributing to cleanliness.
Media friends have also played a positive role.
But the beginning has been good, efforts have been made and we will be successful, this belief has also been created.
This is also necessary and only then talk about rural India, so far, about two crore and twenty-five million toilets have been constructed and in the coming one year, there is an intention to build more than one crore toilets.
I had just gone to Gujarat, then the officers told me that Porbandar, which is the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will prove the goal of Porbandar on October 2.
Congratulations and congratulations to those who are trying to do this work and I urge the countrymen to take this pledge and move forward by taking a pledge to respect mothers and sisters and for the health of small children.
Especially I want to present a scheme for the young friends who use technologies nowadays.
Everyone has the right to know what the cleanliness mission is in your city and for this, the Government of India has given a telephone number - 1969.
We know, Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and celebrated the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019.
These 1969 numbers - You will not only be able to know the situation of construction of toilets in your city but also apply for construction of toilets.
The Government of India has also appealed to the corporate world to come forward.
Sponsor such young professionals who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Develops.
This cleanliness campaign is not even a matter of confined to rites.
Cleanliness is not enough.
In today's era, health connects with cleanliness and revenue models are also essential along with cleanliness.
We need to be a part of the waste to health and therefore we have to move forward towards the cleanliness mission as well as the waste to compost.
The fertilizer companies have been asked to buy the compost that is prepared from the waste.
This will be provided to the farmers who want to go to organic farming.
Those who want to improve the health of their land, those who have suffered a lot due to chemical fertilizers, if they need such fertilizers in some quantity then they should be provided.
And Mr. Amitabh Bachchan ji is contributing very much to this work as a brand ambassador.
It's a work like doing this.
Ministers from all over the country, Chief Ministers from all over the country, Mayor from the metropolitan cities, commissioners from all over the country are going to contemplate and contemplate on this thing.
What can happen in technology
How can employment opportunities be increased in this
All the topics are going to be discussed.
And I see that new news continues to come for cleanliness.
Just one day I read in the newspaper that the students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started a Jagaran campaign for toilet construction.
He himself worked hard and contributed to building about 9,000 toilets.
In the past, you must have seen that a team led by Ong Commander Paramveer Singh had swimming from Devprayag to Ganga Sagar and swimming up to 2800 kilometers and delivered a message of cleanliness.
The Government of India has also made a calendar of one year for its respective departments.
Every department focuses on cleanliness for 15 days.
In the coming October, from 1st to 15th October, the Rinking Water and Sanitation Department, Panchayati Raj Department, Rural Development Department - these three are going to work together by making a roadmap for cleanliness in their respective areas.
And the last two weeks of the month of October, from 16th October to 31st October, three and the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Food Processing India.
My citizens also request that if you have a relationship with the work done by these departments then you should also join.
You must have seen that the survey campaign of cleanliness is also going on these days.
Earlier, what is the situation of cleanliness by surveillance of 73 cities was presented to the people of the country.
Now there is a turn of more than 1 lakh people who are about 500 people and because of this there is a belief in every city that let's go back, let's go back, we will do something good next time.
There is an atmosphere of cleanliness competition.
I hope that all our citizens should contribute to this campaign.
October 2 is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
The Swachh Bharat Mission is going on for two years.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Diwali, I urge you to buy something or the other of Khadi.
This time too, I urge every family to have some khadi so that Diwali's given to the poor house can be burnt.
On October 2, while Sunday, as a citizen, can we join ourselves somewhere in cleanliness
2 hours, 4 hours physically connect yourself to the work of cleanliness and I would like to tell you that you should share a photo of your cleanliness campaign on the Narendra Modi App.
If you are video then share video.
Look, with the efforts of our people across the country, once again this movement will get a new strength and a new speed.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we resolve to do something or the other for the country.
My dear countrymen, there is a pleasure in themselves to give it in life, whether anyone recognise it or not.
Their campaign is to bring food items, clothes, all these things together to the needy.
When I was in Gujarat, all our workers used to come out in the streets and the families used to demand the old toys and the toys that used to come to the poor towns, they used to present them in the Anganwadi.
This is a kind of donation festival.
I convey my best wishes to the youngsters who are engaged in this work.
My dear countrymen, today is 25th September, this is the occasion of the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Ji and the centenary year of his birth is being started from today.
The theory of Sarvajan Hitay-Sarvajan Sukhay Antyodaya - this is their contribution.
Mahatma Gandhi also used to talk about the welfare of the last person.
How to get the fruit of development to the poorest of the poor
He had presented the entire economic agenda in the words of water to every farm.
The country celebrates their birth centenary year as poor welfare year.
We can liberate the country from poverty by going to the society, governments, everybody's attention and the benefits of development to the poor.
It is a symbolic form of the poor welfare year of the same century.
I respectfully bow down to Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji, the inspiration of all of us, the rich devotion of our ideological heritage.
My dear countrymen, I had started Mann Ki Baat two years ago on the day of Vijayadashmi.
It was my authentic endeavour that Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme to praise government work.
How the common man of this country inspires me.
What are the hopes and aspirations of the common man of this country
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the way you appreciated the Mann Ki Baat, the way Savara blessed me.
I am also grateful to All India Radio that he not only broadcast these things but also made every effort to deliver it to all the languages.
I am also grateful to the countrymen who wrote letters after Mann Ki Baat and suggested the doors of the government, highlighted the shortcomings of the government and All India Radio provided platforms for solving problems by making special programmes on such letters and calling the people of the government.
So Mann Ki Baat is not just a 15-20-minute dialogue, it has become a new opportunity for social change.
What can be the cause of great satisfaction for anyone and therefore I express my gratitude to everyone associated with making it a success.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durga-Puja next week, the festival of Vijayadashmi, the preparations for Deepawali, in a way a different atmosphere happens in the entire country.
This is a festival of power and pursuit and the unity of the society is the power of the country.
Whether it is Navratri or Durga-Puja, how should it be the festival of worship of power, the festival of unity of society
How did the festival connecting the people become
And that is the means of true power and then we can celebrate the festival of victory by doing tax together.
Come, sadhana of power, let's go with the mantra of unity.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar yesterday is the birth anniversary of Hockey's magician Dhyan Chand Ji on 29th August.
This day is celebrated as National Sports Day all over the country.
I pay homage to Dhyan Chand Ji and on this occasion I would like to remind you all of them of their contribution.
In 1928, in 1932, in 1936, he played an important role in giving India a gold medal for Hockey Hockey.
We all know the name of cricket lover Bradman.
He had said to Dhyan Chand ji - We scales goals like runs. Dhyanchand ji was a living example of sportsman spirit and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, during a match, an opposition player hocked Dhyan Chand ji's head.
There was only 10 minutes left to end the match at that time.
And Dhyan Chand ji made three rounds in those 10 minutes and said that I gave the revenge of injury to the round.
My dear countrymen, whenever the time of Mann Ki Baat comes, there are many suggestions on MyGov or on the Narendra ModiApp.
This kind of attachment to the ordinary citizens, so much awareness and pressure on the Prime Minister of the country to talk about it, I see it very positive.
Beyond cricket, there is so much love for the citizens of India and for sports, there is so much awareness and so much information.
Reading this message for me, this too became a cause of great inspiration in itself.
A Mr. Ajit Singh has written on the Narendra ModiApp, please speak this time on the education of daughters and their participation in sports in Mann Ki Baat because he has made the country proud by winning medals in Rio Lympics.
Any Mr. Sachin writes that you are requested to mention Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa Karmakar in the matter of mind this time.
The medal we got, the daughters gave.
Our daughters once again proved that they are not less than anybody in any way.
It seems like the daughters of the whole of India have taken the initiative to illuminate the name of the country.
On MyGov, Shikhar Thakur has written that we could do better in the lympics.
He has written that Honourable Modi sir, first of all congratulated the two medals we won in Rio.
But I want to draw your attention to whether our performance was really good
And the answer is, no.
We need to set a long journey in sports.
Our parents still emphasize on studying and occupying academics.
In the society, the game is still considered to be a waste of time.
We need to change this thinking.
The society needs motivation.
And no one can do this well with you.
Similarly, Shriman Satyaprakash Mehra ji has written on the Narendra ModiApp that there is a need to occupy electronic activities in Mann Ki Baat, especially children and youth with sports.
Thousands of people have expressed this feeling in a way.
It can not be denied that we could not perform according to our hope.
In some cases it happened that those who performed in India and those who performed in the sports of India could not even reach there and only two medals have been found in the medal table.
But it is also true that despite not getting the medal, if you look at it, for the first time in many subjects, the players of India have shown a lot of good deeds.
Now see, within the shooting, our innovative Bindra ji was in fourth place and he missed medals in a very short gap.
In Gymnastic, Deepa Karmakar also wondered that she was in fourth place and due to a very little difference she missed medals.
But how can we forget this thing that it is the first Indian daughter to do uality for lympics and for lympic finals
Something similar happened in Tennis with Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna's pair.
This time we performed well in athletics.
After P.T. Usha, for the first time in 32 years, Lalita Babar qualified for track fields.
You will be happy to know that after 36 years the women hockey team reached the lympics.
In Boating, Vikas Krishna Yadav reached the quarter-inal, but could not brone.
Many players, for example - Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhoknal, Atanu Das are many names, whose performance is good.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
But if we continue to do the same, then perhaps we will be disappointed again.
I have announced a committee.
The Government of India will go in its depth and will study what is happening in the world.
We will make a roadmap for what we can do.
2020, 2024, 2028 - With a far-reaching thinking, we have to plan.
I also urge the State Governments to create such committees and what can we do within the sports world, what can our state do, what can the state do, what can the state like one of its own sports and two sports
And I urge every citizen in India to send suggestions to me on the Narendra Modi App.
Write to the government, discuss the Association and give your memorandum to the government.
State governments should discuss and send their suggestions.
My dear countrymen, September 5 is the Teachers Day.
I used to learn a lot from these small boys too.
For me, there was also a Teachers Day on 5th September and for me, it was also a day of education.
But this time I have to go to the G-20 Summit and I have decided to express my feelings in Mann Ki Baat today.
The mother's place in life is the place of the same teacher.
And we have seen teachers who are more concerned about themselves.
They spend their lives for their disciples, for their students.
These days, after Rio Lympics, Pulela Gopichand ji is discussed all around.
They are players, but they have presented an example of what is a good teacher.
Today I see Gopichand ji as an excellent teacher besides a player.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pulela Gopichand ji, his penance, his dedication to the game and his way of enjoying the success of our students.
Teacher's contribution to all of us always feels confused.
5th September is the birthday of former President of India, Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji and the country celebrates him as Teachers Day.
They reached any place in life, but they always tried to live as a teacher.
Sometimes I think, I remember so many stories of my teachers because they used to be our hero in our small villages.
But today I can say with happiness that one of my teachers - now he is 90 years old - even today his letter comes to me every month.
And even at the age of 90, I am surprised that even in this situation he writes with so many beautiful letters and my own letters are very bad, because of this, whenever I see somebody's good letters, I feel very much respected.
Be it photographs with your teacher on the Narendra ModiApp, be it an incident with your teacher, be it an inspirational thing for your teacher, you must share.
See, it is also very valuable in itself to see the contribution of teachers in the country with the eyes of the students.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival will be held in a few days.
Ganesh ji is a dissolution and we all want that our country, our society, our family, every person, his life should be disintegrated.
But when Ganesh talks about the festival, it is very natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak ji.
The tradition of the public Ganesh festival - this is the gift of Lokmanya Tilak ji.
Through the public Ganesh Festival, he made this religious occasion a festival of national awareness and a festival of social rites.
And through the public Ganesh Festival, there should be great discussions about the questions that touch the society and life and the creation of programmes should be such that the society gets new energy and new speed.
Even today, now not only Maharashtra but also in every corner of India, public Ganesh festivals have started taking place.
All the youngsters also prepare a lot to do this, enthusiasm is also very much.
And some people have still made a lot of effort to follow the spirit that Lokmanya Tilak ji had kept.
He holds discussions on public subjects, essays compete and competes with Rangoli.
It also highlights the issues that touch the society in a artistical manner.
In a way, a big campaign for public education runs through the Public Ganesh Festival.
Lokmanya Tilak ji gave us this inspirational mantra that Swaraj is our birth right.
Suraj should be our priority, can we not send a message from the public Ganesh Festival about this mantra
Come on, I invite you.
It is true that festival is the power of society.
Festival fills a new life in the life of a person and society.
Life is impossible without festival but it has to be moulded according to the demand of time.
This time I have seen that many people have written a lot on Ganeshotsav and Durga Puja - those things.
And they are worried about the environment.
Someone has made Shri Shankar Narayan Prashant, he has said with a great request that Modi ji, tell people about Mann Ki Baat that do not use the idols of Ganesh ji made from the Plaster of Paris.
Why not use Ganesh ji made of soil of the village pond
The statues made by the POP are not favorable for the environment.
They have expressed great pain, others have also done it.
I also pray to all of you, why not we come back to the idols of Ganesh, the idols of Durga by using soil - our old tradition.
Conservation of the environment, protecting our rivers and ponds, protecting the small animals of this water from the pollution in it - this is also the service of God.
Ganesh ji is a dissolution.
So we should not make Ganesh ji, who create disintegration.
I don't know how you will take these things in my form.
Several such institutions, individuals work very hard for the Ganesh of the soil.
Co-friendly Ganesh Festival - this is also the work of social service.
There is still time between Durga Puja.
Now we decide that the idols that our old families used to make will also get employment and they will be made of pond or river soil, then they will go back and get it, then the environment will also be protected.
My best wishes to you all on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be presented to Mother Teresa on 4th September with the title of saint.
Mother Teresa had put her entire life for the service of the poor in India.
It is natural for all Indians to be proud of those who have served the poor people of India, when Mother Teresa gets the title of saints.
In the event that will be held on September 4, an official delegation led by the Government of India, our External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj will also be sent there.
From the saints, from the saints, from the sages, from the sages, from the great men, we get to learn something or the other.
We will continue to find something or the other, we will continue to learn and we will continue to do something good.
My dear countrymen, how big change comes when development becomes a mass movement.
Man Shakti is considered to be the form of God.
In the past, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the people with the help of five state governments for clean Ganga, for clean Ganga.
On the 20th of this month, people were invited in Allahabad that they were the heads of villages living on the banks of the Ganges.
There were also men, women were also.
They came to Allahabad and the heads of the villages of the Ganges coast took oath in the witness of Mother Ganga that they would immediately stop the tradition of open defecation in their villages of the Ganges coast, campaign to make toilets and the village will contribute completely to the cleanliness that the village will not allow the Ganga to be dirty.
I have come to Allahabad for this resolution, somebody came from Uttarakhand, somebody came from Uttar Pradesh, somebody came from Bihar, somebody came from Jharkhand, somebody came from West Bengal and I congratulate them for this work.
I congratulate all the Ministries of the Government of India and congratulate the Ministers who have fulfilled this vision.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of all the 5 states that they have taken an important step in cleaning the Ganga by adding Jan Shakti.
My dear countrymen, some things touch me sometimes and I have a special respect for those who imagine it.
On July 15, more students from about seventeen to hundred schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh collectively wrote a letter to their parents.
Someone wrote in English, somebody wrote in Hindi, somebody wrote in Chhattisgarhi, he wrote a letter to his parents and said that there should be toilet in our house.
These children of seven to seventeen years of age did this work.
And it was so impressive that when the school came on the second day after getting the letter, the parents had caught him a letter and the parents had promised that they would make toilets by the date of the function.
Congratulations to those who came to this imagination and congratulate the students who made these efforts and congratulated the parents who decided to take their child's letter seriously and make toilets.
This is what inspires us.
Koppal district of Karnataka, Mallamma, a daughter of sixteen years old in this district - this daughter satyagraha against her family.
It is said that he had left the food and he too had to ask for anything, not for bringing good clothes, not for eating sweets, but for daughter Mallamma, it was said that there should be toilet in our house.
Now the family had no economic condition, the daughter was stuck on id, she was not ready to leave her Satyagraha.
Mohammad Shafi, the head of the village, came to know that Mallamma had satyagraha for toilet, then also see the specialty of the head of the village Mohammad Shafi that he spent eighteen thousand rupees and built a toilet within a week.
Look at the strength of this daughter Mallamma's jid and see the head of the village like Mohammad Shafi.
How the roads are opened to solve problems, this is the manpower.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has become the dream of every Indian.
Some Indians have become a resolution.
Some Indians have made it their own.
But everybody is associated with it in some form, everybody is contributing to it.
He will have a competition and those who will be victorious on October 2, Gandhi Jayanti will be rewarded.
Hey, nowadays you can make films from your mobile phone camera.
Come on, move forward, you have my invitation.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to deepen our relations with our neighbors, our relations should be simple and our relationship should be alive.
A very important thing happened in the past, our President, Honble Pranab Mukherjee, started the AIRC Friendship Channel in Kolkata.
Now many people will feel that the President should also inaugurate the Channel of Radio.
But this is not the channel of ordinary radio, it is a very important step.
Bangladesh is in our neighborhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are still living with the same cultural heritage.
So here, All India Radio Friendship and Bangladesh Betar will share content and Bengali people will enjoy the AIR on both sides.
All India Radio has a great contribution to people to people contact.
The President launched it.
I also thank Bangladesh for their involvement with us for this work.
I also congratulate All India Radio's friends that they are contributing to foreign policy too.
My dear countrymen, you have given me the work of a good Prime Minister, but I am also a person like you.
And sometimes emotional events touch me a little more.
Such emotional events also give new energy, inspiration and inspiration to the people of India.
In the past, I got a letter, touched my mind.
A mother of about 84 years, who is a retired teacher, wrote this letter to me.
If he had not forbidden me in his letter that I would never have declared my name, then I had the mind that today I should talk to you by giving them the name and he wrote that when you had appealed to leave the gas subsidy, I had left the gas subsidy and later I forgot.
The letter of the Prime Minister of India for me is not less than a Padmashree.
My countrymen, you will be aware that I have tried to send a letter to those who left the gas subsidy and some of my representatives should go to them and give them a letter.
My effort is to write letters to more than one crore people.
Under the same scheme, my letter came to this mother and he wrote to me that you are doing good work.
Your campaign to liberate the poor mothers from the smoke of stove and that is why I am a retired teacher, I will be 90 years old in a few years and I am sending you a donation of Rs. 50,000 so that you can work to free such poor mothers from the smoke of stove.
You can imagine, as a general teacher, the mother who is passing on a retired pension, when you give 50 thousand rupees and poor mothers and sisters to get rid of the smoke of stove and to provide gas connection.
The question is not Rs. 50,000, the question is of the spirit of that mother and such kind of mothers and sisters are their blessings, which makes my country confident and powerful for the future.
And he did not even write me the letter as the Prime Minister, wrote a simple letter - Modi Bhaiya.
I bow down to that mother and also salute the mothers of India who have always been doing something or the other by suffering a lot.
My dear countrymen, we were troubled due to famine last year, but this month of August was constantly filled with floods.
Floods occurred in some parts of the country.
The State Governments, the Central Government, the units of the Local Swaraj Institute, the social institutions, the citizens, have made every effort to do whatever they can.
But among the news of these floods, there were some news that had to be remembered more.
What is the strength of unity, let's go together, how big can the result be
This will be remembered in August this year.
In August 2016, the parties who had a huge political protest, the parties who did not leave a single chance against each other, and almost 90 parties across the country, in Parliament too, a lot of parties and all parties passed the law of GST together.
Its credit goes to all parties.
And this is an example of how big work is done if all the parties go in one direction together.
In the same way, whatever happened in Kashmir, all the political parties of the country together talked about Kashmir with a voice.
He also gave a message to the world, also sent a message to separatist elements and expressed our condolences to the citizens of Kashmir.
It is the opinion of all of us that from the head of the village to the Prime Minister, if anybody knows in Kashmir, whether it is a young man or a security worker, this loss is ours, it is ours.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by furthering these small children, sometimes they will have to answer these innocent children.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to give more strength, highlight more and only then can the country create a bright future.
I have faith in the power of 1. 25 million countrymen.
Thank you very much today.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar, this morning I got the opportunity to spend some moments with the youth of Delhi and I believe that in the coming days, the color of sports in the whole country will color every young man with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
We all know that in a few days, the Mahakumbh of the world's largest sports is going to be.
Rio is going to repeat in our ears.
Our hopes and aspirations are very much, but the work of encouraging those players and those who have been played in Rio is also for hundreds of crores of countrymen.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a very good event - Run for Rio, Sports and Jio, Sports and Toys.
In the coming days, wherever we are, do something or the other to encourage our players.
Whatever the hobby of eating, everything has to be left.
I'm ready to do this on your behalf too.
To deliver these sportspersons your message, the country is ready to become the Prime Minister Postman.
If there is no research and innovation, then as the stagnant water spreads dirt, technology also becomes a burden.
And if we continue to live with the confidence of old technology without research and innovation, then we will become black in the changing era and therefore in the new generation the attraction to science, research and innovation towards technology and for this the government has also taken several steps.
And so I say - Let us innovate and when I say let us innovate, then my AIDS
If we want to create net generation innovators then our children will have to connect with them and therefore the Government of India has taken the initiative of an Atal Tinkering Lab.
Wherever there will be such tinkering lab festivals in schools, they will be given Rs. 10 lakhs and Rs. 10 lakhs will be given for maintenance in five years.
If we have a strong and prosperous Incubation Centre, then an arrangement is available for innovation, for start-ups, for experiment and for bringing it to a position.
In the same way, India is battling many problems.
We see problems in everyday life.
Now we will have to find technological solutions.
We have called upon an Atal Grand Challenges countrys younger generation to look at the problem, find ways of technology for solutions, research and innovation.
The Government of India wants to promote the technologies discovered for solving our problems by giving special awards.
My dear countrymen, some time ago we were worrying about famine and these days the joy of rain is also coming and the news of floods is also coming.
The State Government and the Central Government are making a lot of efforts by mixing shoulders with shoulders to help the flood victims.
In spite of some difficulties due to rain, every mind, every human mind becomes fascinated because there is rain and cultivation at the centre point of our entire economic activity.
Sometimes there is such a disease that we regret all life.
Engue can be avoided.
Keep in mind a bit of cleanliness, be cautious and try to be safe, pay special attention to the children and it is not the thought that such a disease occurs in the poor settlement.
Engue comes first in a happy and prosperous area and therefore we understand it.
You must have seen advertising on T, but sometimes we are indifferent to know about the action.
The government, hospitals and doctors will do their work but we will also be cautious for not entering our households, in our area, in our family and for not getting any disease caused by water.
I would like to draw your attention towards another trouble, dear countrymen.
Life has become so comfortable, it has become such a race that sometimes we do not have time to think for ourselves.
If you get sick then you feel sick and get alright soon and therefore you put any antibiotic in the body.
Immediately one gets rid of the disease, but my dear countrymen, these paths can create a very serious problem in taking antibiotics.
You can get relief for some moments but without the advice of doctors, we should stop taking antibiotics.
I urge you to complete the course as long as the doctor has asked to take.
The bacteria that spread tuberculosis and malaria are bringing about such changes in themselves at a rapid pace that medicines have no effect.
In medical language it is called antibiotic resistance and therefore it is necessary to follow the rules of antibiotics.
When the matter of health has come out, I want to add one more thing.
The concern of the mothers who are in pregnancy in our country is sometimes very sad.
In our country, about 3 crore women take pregnancy every year, but some mothers die at the time of delivery, sometimes mother dies, sometimes child dies, sometimes child and mother dies.
It is fine that in the last decade, there has been a decrease in the rate of untimely death of the mother, but still still a large amount of pregnant mothers can not save their lives.
During pregnancy or later deficiency of blood, reproductive infection, high BP - when will you destroy his life
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign for the last few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
Under this campaign, on the 9th of every month, all pregnant women will be tested free of cost in government health centers.
The lives of both mothers and children can be saved and I am particularly aware of Gyneclogist whether you cannot provide these services free of cost for the poor mothers on 9th of a month.
Can my doctor brothers and sisters not apply for this work for the poor for twelve days in a year
I am sure you will definitely join.
My dear countrymen, today the entire world worrys about climate change, global warming and environment.
It is discussed collectively in the country and the world.
These things have been emphasized in India for centuries.
Even in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna discusses the tree, even in the battlefield, worrying about the tree means how much it will be, we can guess.
In the Gita, Lord Krishna says - Ashwatth: Sarva Vrikshana i.e. I am a people in all trees.
Venus has been said in the policy - Nasti original research - there is no such vegetation in which there is no medicinal properties.
Those who donate the tree, they wire the tree in the world like a child.
Therefore, the parents who wish for their welfare plant good trees and follow their children.
Whether it is our scripture-singer, the Venus policy, the discipline festival of the Mahabharata - but in today's generation there are some people who show these ideals by living.
A few days ago, an example of Sonal, a daughter of Pune, came in my mind, she touched my mind.
In the Discipline Festival of Mahabharata, the tree also fulfills the responsibilities of the child in the world and Sonal has taken the initiative to fulfil the desires of the society not only of his parents.
Khandu Maruti Mahatra, a farmer of Narayanpur village in Junnnar taluka of Pune in Maharashtra, he married his granddaughter Sonal in a big inspiration.
Such a scene touching the mind was in that picture.
The idea that Sonal himself is a agricultural graduate has come to him and to offer mango plants in the marriage, look at the love of nature in the best way.
In a way, Sonal's marriage became an immortal story of nature love and I congratulate Sonal and Mr. Mahatreji for this innovative effort.
And many people do such experiments.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a large number of pilgrims come to the temple of Amba Ji in the Bhadra month, once a social worker organisation decided that those who will come to the temple will give them a plant in the prasad and tell them that this is the prasad of Mother Ji, this plant will be made big by going to their villages and houses, the mother will continue to bless you.
I repeatedly tell the farmer brothers that we ruin our land by putting fences on the edge of our fields, why not we cultivate timber instead of that fence.
Today, to make India a home, to make a unit, billions and billions of timbers have to be brought from abroad.
If we plant such trees on the banks of our farms, which come to work in units and houses, then after fifteen-twenty years, you can also sell it by cutting it from the permission of the government and it can also become a new means of your income and can avoid importing timber to India.
In the past, many states have carried out a lot of campaigns using this weather, the Government of India has also passed an AMPA law, due to which more than forty thousand crore states are going to plant trees.
I am told that the Maharashtra government has planted about two and a half million plants in the entire state on July 1, and next year they have resolved to plant three crore plants.
The government created a mass movement.
Rajasthan, Desertland - such a big forest festival and has resolved to plant twenty five lakh plants.
In Rajasthan, twenty five lakh plants are not small.
Those who know the land of Rajasthan, they know how big he has taken.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its green cover city percent by Twenty Twenty-Nine (2029).
Gujarat also has a very bright tradition of the forest festival.
This year, Gujarat has taken up several such projects like Amr Forest, Ekta Forest, Shaheed Forest - as Forest Festival and launched a campaign to plant millions of trees.
I can not mention all the states, but are eligible for congratulations.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa in the past.
This was my first visit and when there is a foreign visit, there is a diplomacy, there are talk of trade, there are discussions about security, there are several months.
But for me, the journey to South Africa was a pilgrimage in a way.
It is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela when they remember South Africa.
In the world, non-violence, love and forgiveness - when these words fall on the ears, Gandhi and Mandela - their faces appear in front of us.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to Phoeni Settlement and the residence of Mahatma Gandhi is known as Sarvodaya.
The train in which Mahatma Gandhi had travelled and the train in which the train had planted Mohandas to make Mahatma Gandhi was also fortunate to visit Piet Warritburg Station.
But what I want to tell, this time I got the opportunity to meet those great personalities who had spent their lives for equality and equal opportunity.
He had fought with Nelson Mandela on his shoulder and had lived with Nelson Mandela in jails for twenty and twenty years.
In a way, he had called upon the entire youth and I got the opportunity to visit these great personalities, Mr. Ahmed Kathara, close associates of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Laloo Chiba, Mr. George Bios, Ronnie Casrils.
Original Indians, but wherever they went, they were there, they were ready to live for those who lived among them.
On his face, even after doing such a great penance, it was not visible anywhere.
A kind of duty - the duties which have been described in the Gita and not the symptoms of the duties, they were completely visible.
My mind will always remember that meeting - equality and equal opportunity.
There can be no big mantra for any society and government.
Equality and mum-bhav, these are the ways, which lead us to a bright future.
Children want a good future.
The priority will be different, but the path is the same and that is the path of development, equality, equal opportunity, equality and mother-in-law.
Let us proud of these Indians who have also shown the original mantras of our lives in South Africa.
Being a woman, I am very sorry to her family.
And as technology is doing a big role in the economic system, those who misuse it also come to the ground.
You must have been confused sometimes and they write to you in such a great way, as if it seems, it's the right letter.
Any duty sends by making a letter pad, your credit card number, debit card number and your account becomes empty through technology.
This is a fraud of new ways. This is a digital fraud.
I believe that if you should avoid this fame, be cautious and if there is any such false thing then you should share your men and friends and make them slightly aware.
I would like that Shilpi Verma has brought a good thing to me and you would have experienced it, but perhaps you would not have seen it so seriously, but I feel that there is a need to see.
My dear countrymen, during the Parliament session these days, I also get the opportunity to meet many people of the country during the session of Parliament.
But these days I had a pleasant experience.
Some students of Aligarh came to me.
Artificial paintings have been done at the station.
Not only this, they collected the plastic bottles or oil cans in the village in such a waste and collected them and planted them with soil and planted them and made vertical gardens.
And by making these vertical gardens in plastic bottles towards the railway station, they gave them a new form in a way.
If you ever go to Aligarh, you must see the station.
Nowadays I am aware of these reports from several railway stations in India and locals are presenting their area on the walls of the railway station through their art.
It feels a newness.
This is an example of what kind of change can be brought about by public participation.
Congratulations to all those working in this way in the country, special congratulations to my colleagues of Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, along with the rainy season, there are festivals in our country.
Festivals will be celebrated in the temples, in the puja houses and you will also be involved in the festival outside the house.
The festival of Rakshabandhan is a festival of special importance here.
Like last year, on the occasion of Rakshabandhan this year too, can you not offer Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters of your country
Think, give such a gift to the sister who really protects him in life.
And I am the first Prime Minister of the country to be born in India.
75 years of uit Hind and 70 years of Indias independence can inspire us, create new hopes and become an opportunity to do something for the country.
The whole country should be coloured with the color of freedom fighters and once again feel the pleasure of freedom.
This environment should be created by all of us and the festival of independence should not be a government programme, it should be the countrymen.
Like Diwali, we should have our own festival.
I hope you too will do something or the other related to the inspiration of patriotism.
Definitely send his picture to the Narendra Modi app.
Make an atmosphere in the country.
Dear countrymen, on August 15, I get a privilege to talk to the country from the ramparts of the Red Fort.
There will also be some things in your mind, which you would like to keep your point of view as much from the Red Fort.
I invite you, the ideas that come in your mind, which feel that as your representative, as your principal servant, I should tell you this thing from the Red Fort.
What should be said from the ramparts of the Red Fort, it is a matter of hundred and a half million countrymen.
Let me invite you, let us recall the blessings of freedom, remember the great men who have spent their lives for India and move forward with a resolve to do something for the country.
Namaskar to all the countrymen.
My dear countrymen, greetings.
I am also grateful to All India Radio that he has made a successful effort to present this Mann Ki Baat in regional languages at 8. 00 pm.
And I am also happy to note that those who listen to me later send their feelings to me through the letter, through the telephone, through the MyGov website, through the Narendra Modi App.
Many of your things help me in the work of the government.
How active the government should be in public interest, how important the work of public interest should be, my interaction with you for these things is very useful.
I hope that by becoming more active, you will definitely emphasize how democracy goes through public participation.
The heat is increasing.
The maximum part of the country is experienced by the heat fire.
Mercury is touching the sky.
Due to the environment, these problems are increasing.
The forests were reduced, the trees were cut off and in a way humanity destroyed nature and paved the way for its destruction.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
There are discussions for the environment all over the world, there is concern.
This time, the United Nations has put the topic on the World Environment Day on Cero Tolerance for Illegal Wildlife Trade.
It will be discussed, but we have to discuss trees and plants, also discuss water, how to increase our forests.
Because you must have seen the fire in the forests in the lap of Uttarakhand, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir - Himalayas in the past.
Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha - Although there has been a tradition like the government, I could have a meeting of all drought-affected states, but I did not do this.
What to say to the states, they heard them closely.
Generally, in the government, how much money went from the Government of India and how much the expenditure was spent - it does not matter closely.
It was also surprising to the officials of our Government of India that many states have made excellent efforts in the field of water, in respect of environment, in order to tackle the situation of drought, for animals, for the affected humans and in a way the government of any party in every corner of the country, it was also felt that the problem was observed, what should be possible to deal with the long-term situation and what should be the permanent treatment.
In a way, it was also a learning experiment for me and I have also told my Policy Commission that there should be some work on the best practices that should be taken in all the states.
Some states, especially Andhra Pradesh, have used a lot of technology.
I would like to further deliver the special efforts made by the NITI Aayog to the States and the States.
Public participation is the basis of a very big success in solving such problems.
As we go to the temple, give some prasad and even a little prasad falls, then there is anxiety in the mind.
Take him up and apologize to God five times.
This water is also the offering of God.
If a drop is wasted, then we should have pain.
And that is why water and irrigation is equally important, water conservation is equally important, water and irrigation is equally important and that is why per drop-more crop, micro-irrigation, minimum water crops are being produced.
Now it is a matter of happiness that in many states our sugarcane farmers are also using micro-irrigation, somebody is using drip-irrigation or some sprinkler.
If I sit with the states then some states have successfully used drip-irrigation for paddy and rice, and due to this their yield also increased, water was saved and wages were also reduced.
When I heard from these states, there are many states that have taken bigger targets, especially Maharashtra, Andhra and Gujarat.
Three states have done a lot of work in the drip-irrigation and they are trying to add two to three lakh hectares of micro-irrigation every year.
If this campaign has been run in all the states then agriculture will also benefit a lot, water will also be accumulated.
Our brothers of Telangana have tried to utilize the water of Godavari and Krishna river through Mission Bhagirathi.
Andhra Pradesh has also tried to use technology and ground water recharging in the Neeru Pragati Mission.
In the mass movement created by Maharashtra, people are also sweating in it, they are also giving money.
I really feel that this movement will be very useful to save Maharashtra from the future crisis.
Chhattisgarh has launched Loksuraj - Jalsuraj campaign.
Madhya Pradesh has Balram Talab Scheme - Nearly 22 thousand ponds are not small statistics .
Rajasthan and Gujarat, where there are more ancient times, have been a big campaign to revive them as a water temple.
Rajasthan has launched the Chief Minister Water Self-Self-Self-Self-Self-Self-Campaign.
Jharkhand is a wild area, but there are some areas, where there is a problem of water.
He has launched a huge campaign of Heck Cam.
They have tried to stop water.
Some states have campaigned to stop ten-ten, twenty-two kilometers of water by making small dams in the rivers.
This is a very pleasant experience.
I also tell the countrymen that this June, July, August, September - we decide, one drop of water will not be wasted.
And it doesn ' t mean that water is not just the subject of farmers .
This village, the poor, the labourers, the farmers, the urban, the rural, the rich and the poor are connected to everyone and therefore the rainy season is coming, the water is our priority and this time when we celebrate Diwali, also enjoy how much water we saved and how much water we stopped.
You see, our happiness will increase manifold.
How unprecedented is the treasure given by the Lord
The media gave a detailed account of the problem of water in the past.
I hope that the media should guide the people towards saving water, drive campaigns and also become media partners for the ever-liberation of water crisis. I also invite them.
My dear countrymen, we have to make a modern India.
We have to make a transparent India.
If we have to bring a lot of systems equally from one corner of India to the other, then our old habits will also have to change a bit.
Today, I want to touch a topic on which if you help me, we can move forward successfully in that direction.
If you want salt, then give so much vegetable in return.
Business used to run from the barter system itself.
But now the time has changed.
The whole world is moving towards the cashless society.
Through the electronic technology system, we can also get the money and pay the money.
You can buy things, you can also pay bills.
And there will never be any question of theft of the stolen pockets of the pockets.
There will be no concern about keeping accounts and automatic accounts.
The beginning will seem slightly difficult, but once the habit will take place, this system will be simplifying.
And this is the possibility that the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana that was launched these days, the bank accounts of almost all the families of the country were opened.
So, in coordination with Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile (JAM), JAM, we can move forward towards this cashless society.
You must have seen that RuPay card has been given with Jan-han account.
In the coming days, this card is going to work with both credit and debit.
I don't need to take the money out of the zeb, count.
There is no need to roam together.
In the initiatives taken by the Government of India, how to pay by a PSU, how to take money.
It will be very easy to transact Money through your mobile phone and it is a matter of happiness that NP.I.
In a way, the bank has worked in that direction at your gate.
Post Office has also been alerted for banking services.
If we learn to use these systems and get used then we will not need this currency, we will not need notes, we will not need money, business will run on our own and there will be a transparency.
Look, once we start, we will move forward with great simplicity.
Twenty years ago, who had thought that so many mobiles would be in our hands.
Gradually became a habit, now you can not live without it.
Maybe this cashless society can take the same form but it will be better if it happens in less time.
My dear countrymen, whenever the games of lympics come and whenever the sports start, we sit in the sir gate, how much we were left behind in the Gold Medicine, we did not get the silver merged and did not run from the bronze.
Everyone has in their own way to encourage and encourage our sportspersons who go to Rio Cympics.
Writing a song, making a cartoon, conveying some good wishes, encourage some game but the entire country should create a very positive environment towards these players.
The results that will come - will come.
It becomes a big force in itself, when the player feels that hundred and a half million countrymen are standing with him, then he gets encouraged.
I had talked about the under-17 World Up and the suggestions I received from all over the country and these days I have seen that an atmosphere of Cootball has started to be seen throughout the country.
Many people are making their teams with initiatives.
I have received thousands of suggestions on the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
Maybe many people would not have played but there is so much interest in the game of thousands of youngsters in the country. It was a pleasant experience for me in myself.
We know the attachment of cricket and India but I have seen so much attachment to Cootball and it indicates a very pleasant future in itself.
So in the coming days, we will create an atmosphere of zeal and enthusiasm for all our sportspersons.
Everything should not be done by the test of victory and defeat.
With sportsman spirit, India made its identity in the world.
I appeal to the countrymen to do something in creating an atmosphere of enthusiasm and zeal towards our sports partners.
In the last eight-ten days, new results are coming from somewhere.
I am talking about those students who have worked hard throughout the year, have started coming after one of the 10th, 12th and one after the other.
It is clear that our daughters are showing valour.
It's a matter of happiness.
My best wishes and congratulations to those who have succeeded in these results.
I would like to tell those who have not been successful once again that there is a lot to do in life.
If the result has not come according to our wish, then no life is stuck.
We should live with confidence, we should move ahead with confidence.
But a big new kind of question has come in front of me and I had never thought about it.
But I was surprising that everybody in the house had said to me this thing, hey man, four marks would have been more and you would have been 90 percent.
That is, my family and my friend, my teacher - no one was happy with my 89. 33 percent marks.
Everyone was telling me, man, your 90 percent for four marks.
Now I cannot understand how to handle such a situation.
Is this everything in life
What did I do, wasn't it good
Did I also fall a little less
I do not know, there is a burden experience on my mind.
I have read your letter very carefully and I feel that this pain will be of millions and millions of students like you because an atmosphere has become such that instead of satisfaction for what has happened, it is another form of negativeness.
By finding dissatisfaction from everything, we can never take society towards satisfaction.
It would have been better if your family, your friends and friends had appreciated your 89.33 percent, then you would have decided to do more in yourself.
I have written Santosh Giri Goswami from Jodhpur, he has written almost the same way.
They say that people around me are not accepting our results.
I don't remember the poem but I had read it a long time ago, a poet had written that I made a picture of pain on the vanvas of life.
Would that a single audience had also shed tears on the picture of my pain.
This was the words of poetry, I do not remember now, but it was the poem of a long time ago, but this was the feeling.
There is a burden on you to fulfill the expectations of the people.
I will tell you so much that in such a situation you do not lose your balance.
Everyone expresses expectations, keep listening, but be steadfast on your point of view and try to do something better.
But if you do not satisfy what has been found, then you will never be able to build a new building.
The strong foundation of success is the basis of great success.
The dissatisfaction arising out of success cannot be the ladder of success, it becomes the guarantee of failure.
But I want to say this more than my neighbours and parents and colleagues that by grace with your children, do not impose your expectations on them.
Friends, Is it sometimes failing in life, is it that life stops
Whoever cannot bring good marks in Feam, he goes ahead in sports, goes ahead in music, goes ahead in artwork and goes ahead in business.
God has given some or the other wonderful mode to everyone.
Just recognise the power within yourself, emphasize it, you will go ahead.
And it happens everywhere in life.
You must have heard the instrument named Santur.
There was a time when the Santur instrument was linked to the local music in the Valley of Kashmir.
But there was a Pandit Shiv Kumar, who handled him and today made an important instrument in the world.
Sahnai - Sahnai was at a limited place in the entire area of our music.
His place was at the gate of most of the kings and kings who used to be courts.
But when Ustad Bismillah Khan took the hand of Sahnai, today it became the best instrument of the world, it has become an identity of it.
My dear countrymen, sometimes I see that the expenditure on the health of our poor families also imbalances the track of life.
And it is true that the cost of not being sick is very low, but after being sick, the cost of being healthy is very high.
Why do not we live such a life so that there is no disease, there is no economic burden on the family.
One is the biggest basis for saving cleanliness from disease.
If anyone can do the biggest service of the poor, then he can do cleanliness.
And the other for which I constantly urge, it is Yoga.
Some people also call him Yoga.
June 21 is International Day of Yoga.
There is also an attraction to Yoga all over the world, devotion and the world has accepted it.
Our ancestors have a precious gift to us, which we have given to the world.
The world suffering from tension gives the power to live a balanced life.
Provention is better than time. Being healthy in the lives of a person associated with Yoga, being balanced, being rich in strong will and power, being a life full of unbelief and concentration in every work are these simple achievements.
21st June - Yoga Day is not just a event, it has increased its spread, it has become a place in every person's life, every person should spend 20 minutes, 25 minutes and 30 minutes in his daily routine.
And for this, 21 June Yoga Day inspires us.
And sometimes a collective atmosphere causes a change in the life of a person.
Look at this thing, get it done in your village, get it done in your neighborhood, get it done in your city, in your school, in institutions, in every office.
Start a month from now, see, you will become a partner on June 21.
I have read several times that in many offices, Yoga and pranayama are collective as soon as possible in the morning, the efficiency of the entire office increases so much, the culture of the entire office changes and the environment changes.
You must join that day, the whole world is going to do Yoga.
It is my request that you do not stay behind anywhere.
Your health is very important to make India healthy.
My dear countrymen, I constantly join you through Mann Ki Baat.
Dear countrymen, greet you all again.
Okay.
Thank you.
Namaste.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2016
Please change this situation, Ravi ji has expressed great anger but I believe that perhaps he is not angry at me, he is angry at the situation and you will remember that the former President of India, Dr.
P.
J.
Abdul Kalam always used to say that on the first page of the newspaper, only positive news was printed. He used to constantly say this. A few days ago, a newspaper had written to me, he said that we have decided that on Monday we will not give a single negative news, will give positive news.
This time too, I have seen a lot of letters, comments, phone calls have been received. There are many stories, suggestions, inspirations, everybody wants to do something or the other and I also want to say that there is a lot in all these things that I would like to integrate but, there is a time limit, so I cannot even be able to integrate.
You will remember the last time I had discussed a book on the stories of Premchand ji and we had decided to share with everyone about whatever book you read through the Narendra Modi App.
I was seeing that a large number of people have shared information about many types of books
I liked that people are discussing the books written on science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business, lifestyle, and on many such topics.
Some people have also advised me to talk about many more books
But one thing I have to accept is that now I can ' t give time to read a lot of books .
But one advantage has been required, that if you send it by writing, I have got the opportunity to know about many books.
But this is the experience of the last one month, I think that we have to move forward.
Why don't we make an excellent book coorner on the Narendra Modi App and whenever we read a new book, write it there, discuss it and you can sugest a good name for our books coorner.
Friends, It seems that when I had touched this thing in the matter of water conservation, but perhaps today I am feeling that water conservation was a matter of touching your heart before I said it was a matter of common man.
And I am feeling that these days the hearts of India have shaken about water .
Several wise and effective efforts are being made across the country regarding water conservation.
People have shared information about traditional methods .
Media has started several innovative campaigns on water conservation
Whether it is the government, the NGOs are doing something or the other at the war level.
Looking at the strength of collectiveness, the mind feels very good, it is getting very satisfaction.
The villagers donated labour to give a definite direction to the waterfalls flowing from the mountain.
That too a pure indigenous way
This has not only stopped the waste of soil and crop, but the fields are also getting water.
You all will be happy to know that the beautiful state of Northeast Meghalaya has become the first state in the country that has prepared its water policy and water policy.
I congratulate the government there
In Haryana, cultivation of crops that require less water is being promoted and farmers do not have any harm.
I would like to specially congratulate the Government of Haryana for inspiring them to communicate with the farmers, beyond traditional farming and for less water crops.
Now the time has come to pass .
Many fairs are also held on the occasion of festivals .
Why not use these fairs for water conservation
People from every section of the society reach the fairs
We can give the message of water conservation in these fairs very effectively, exhibitions, dramas, festivals and water conservation messages.
Friends, Some things in life fill us with zeal and especially the achievements of children, their achievements and their deeds give us a new energy and that is why today I want to talk about some children and these children are Nidhi Baipotu, Monish Joshi, Dewanshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Aaronitesh Ganguly and Hrithik Ala-Manda.
You will also be filled with pride and zeal from what I will tell about them.
We all know that cancer is a word from which the whole world is afraid .
It seems that all these ten children have lost the deadly disease like cancer and cancer in the battle of their lives, but have illuminated the name of India in the whole world with their actions.
In sports, we often see that players become champions after winning tournaments or winning medals, but this was a rare opportunity where these people were champions before participating in the sports competition and they were also the champions of the war of life.
Actually, World Children's Winners Games were organized in Moscow this month.
This is a unique sports tournament in which young cancer survivors i.e. those who have come out fighting cancer in their lives take part.
Competitions like Shooting, Hess, Swimming, Running, Cootball and Table Tennis were organized in this competition.
All these ten champions of our country won medals in this tournament
Some of these players won medals in more than one game
In fact, 2019 has been a very good year for India in terms of space.
Our scientists had launched A-Sat in March and thereafter, there was no discussion of big and important news like A-Sat at that time in the turmoil of Chandriyaan-2 elections.
In just three minutes from the A-Sat missile, we got the capability to kill Satellite three to hundred kilometers away.
India that achieves this achievement became the fourth country of the world and now, on July 22, the entire country proudly saw how Chandrayaan-2 stepped from Sriharikota to space.
Photos of the launch of Chandrayaan-2 filled the countrymen with pride and zeal, happiness.
Chandrayaan-2, this mission is special in many ways.
Chandrayaan-2, will clarify our understanding about the moon.
This will give us information about the moon in detail, but if you ask me what two big learnings I got from the Chandriyaan-two, then I will say, these two learnings are Faith and Cearlessness i.e. faith and fearlessness
We should trust our talents and capacities, trust our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandryan-two is completely in Indian color.
This is Indian from Heart and Spirit
is completely a indigenous mission
This mission has once again proved that when something new is going to be done in the new sector, I am happy to note that I am happy to note that I am happy that I am happy that I am sure that I am sure that I am sure that I am sure I am sure I am sure that I am sure I am sure I am sure that I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure I am sure that I am sure I am sure that I am sure I am
The way our scientists, in record time, started all the technical issues by uniting day and night, it is unprecedented in itself.
The whole world saw this great penance of scientists
All of us should be proud of this and even in spite of interruption, they have not changed the time of reaching.
We also have to face temporary setbacks in our lives, but always remember that the ability to overcome it is also within us.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share information about a very interesting competition, competition and invite the youngsters of the country to a qui competition.
I urge young friends, students to participate in this ui competition and make it interesting, interesting and memorable with their share.
I urge schools, parents, enthusiastic teachers and teachers to work hard to make their school victorious.
These victorious students will have a historic event of their lives, but for this, you will have to take part in the ui Competition, get maximum marks, you will have to win.
My dear countrymen, you must have served one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baats have speeded up the Swachhta Abhiyan from time to time and similarly the efforts made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey started five years ago today is setting up new criteria of cleanliness with the participation of the people.
It is not that we have achieved an ideal position in cleanliness, but the way we have succeeded in the cleanliness campaign from public places, it is the power of the resolve of one and a half million countrymen, but we are not going to stop so much.
This movement has now moved from cleanliness to beauty
Just a few days ago, I was watching the story of Mr. Yogesh Saini and his team in media.
Yogesh Saini is an engineer and left his job in America and returned to serve Mother Bharti
He took the initiative to make Delhi clean, not just clean, but beautiful.
He started with his team with Lodhi Garden dustbins
Through street art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
From the walls of the Ver Bridge and the school to the slums and slums, they started bouncing their skills and the people got together.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh .
There may be no voice in color and lines, but the messages that are made from these pictures prove to be more effective than thousands of words and we also experience this in the beauty of the Swachhta Abhiyan.
It is very important for us to develop the culture of creating a waste to health in our society.
In a way, so we have to move ahead in the direction of making garbage from garbage.
My dear countrymen, in the past, I read an interesting comment on MyGov.
This convention was from Mohammad Aslam, brother of Shopian, Jammu and Kashmir.
He likes to listen to the Mann Ki Baat program he wrote
I am happy to state that I played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in my State of Jammu and Kashmir.
This program was organized in June.
I think such programmes should be held every three months .
Also, the programme should be online monitoring.
In my view, this was the first of its kind, in which the public had directly interacted with the government.
Brother Mohammad Aslam ji sent this message to me and after reading it, my eagerness to know about the Back to Village Programme increased and when I came to know about it in detail, I felt that the whole country should also be aware of it.
This program shows how desperate the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development.
In this programme, for the first time, the officers who had never seen the villages directly reached the villages, they themselves reached their doorstep so that the obstacles in the development work can be understood and the problems can be addressed.
These programmes lasted a week and in all the about four and a half thousand panchayats of the state, government officials gave detailed information to the villagers about government schemes and programmes.
How can Panchayats be strengthened
How can their income be increased
What is the impact of their services in the lives of the common man  The villagers also openly told their problems .
Friends, There was no government food supply that the officers returned to the village throughout the day but this time the officers spent two days and one night in the Panchayat and gave them an opportunity to spend time in the village.
Several other things were also included to make this programme interesting.
Sports Competition for Children under Khelo India
The same sports kits, MNREGA job cards and SST fertilizers were also distributed.
People of Kashmir became open partners in this festival of development
It is a matter of happiness that the Back to Village Programme was organised in such far-flung villages where government officials had to travel on foot for one day and a half days while climbing the hills through inaccessible roads.
Many officers were so overwhelmed by their welcome that they stayed in villages for more than two days .
It is very pleasant to organize Gram Sabhas in these areas, to participate in a large number of people and to prepare schemes for themselves.
New resolution, new zeal and spectacular results
It is clear that those who want to spread hatred in the path of development, want to create barriers, they can never succeed in their nefarious intentions.
My dear countrymen, Mr. Dattatreya Ramchandra Bendre, honored with the Gyanpeeth Award, presented the glory of the month of Sawan in one of his poems in this way.
People from different cultures and languages celebrate the month of Sawan in their own way throughout India.
Whenever we look around us in this season, it seems as if the earth has covered the green sheet .
All around, a new energy starts communicating
In this sacred month, many devotees visit Kanvad Yatra and Amarnath Yatra, while many people fast regularly and eagerly wait for festivals like Janmashtami and Nag Panchami.
During this time the festival of Raksha Bandhan also comes the symbol of the love of brothers and sisters .
When the Sawan month is talking about, you will be very happy to know that this time the most devotees have joined the Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than three lakh pilgrims have visited the holy Amarnath cave since July 1
More than the pilgrims who had joined this journey for 60 days in 2015, have joined in just 28 days this time.
For the success of Amarnath Yatra, I would particularly like to appreciate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their guests.
Anyone who returns from the journey is convinced of the warmth and spirit of the people of the state.
All these things are going to be very beneficial for tourism in the future .
I am told that in Uttarakhand, since the time Chardham Yatra has started this year, more than 8 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham within one and a half months.
After the severe calamity in 2013, for the first time, such a record number of pilgrims have reached there.
I appeal to all of you that you must visit those parts of the country whose beauty is seen during the monsoon.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and travel, perhaps, there can be no greater teacher than that.
My best wishes to all of you that this beautiful and vibrant month of Sawan will communicate with you new energy, new hope and new hopes.
In the same way , the month of August , leave India , remembers it .
I would like to make some special preparations on August 15. You should find a new way to celebrate this festival of independence.
On the other hand, this is the time when there is heavy rains in many parts of the country.
By the way, when we see T, only one aspect of the rain is seen, all over the flood, filled water, traffic jam
The second picture of monsoon in which our farmer, shining birds, flowing waterfalls, greenery covered earth, enjoying happiness, you will have to come out with your own family.
Rain, freshness and joy i.e. Reshness and appines both bring with them. I wish that this monsoon continues to fill you with happiness.
My dear countrymen, greetings to all of you
Today the people of the Christian community are celebrating Caster all over the world.
I convey my best wishes to all the people of Wester.
And for some people, it will also be a testimony that on the one hand, the T-20 Ricket World Up. Even today, you might have been waiting for the match of India and Australia.
In the past, India has won two best matches against Pakistan and Bangladesh.
A good momentum is visible.
Today, when Australia and India are going to play, I extend my best wishes to the players of both the teams.
65 per cent of the population is young and we have lost in the world of sports.
Time is, the period of a new revolution in sports.
World's 24 teams are coming to play in India.
India won the Gold Medal in 1951, 1962 ASEAN Games and India was ranked fourth in 1956 Cympic Games.
But unfortunately, in the last few decades, we went on the lower piercing, left behind, fell down and fell.
Cootball is an opportunity. Can you suggest me
I consider it a great opportunity to brand India at the global level.
I consider the opportunity to identify India's youth power and what was found between Match and what was lost in that sense.
Through the preparation of this host, we can decorate our strength, express our strength and we can also brand India.
Can you send me your suggestions on this, Narendra ModiApp
My dear students, during the holidays you must have thought for tourism.
Some people go out of their states.
Last time too, I had requested you people to upload photographs from wherever you go.
People, languages, food habits can be seen what they do not know.
India is full of diversity.
Get out to see once you will be watching the whole life, you will be watching
I am fortunate that I have got the opportunity to visit a lot.
When he was not the Chief Minister, he was not the Prime Minister and was a young age like you, I visited a lot.
I think it's a good sign.
It gives an opportunity to see something new in itself.
I hope that when you visit these holidays, can you contribute to cleanliness
Maybe it's not happening in a very scientific way
As a tourist, can you also emphasize cleanliness on tourist destination
I believe my youth will definitely help me in this.
India is far behind in tourism compared to the world.
But we will decide that if we have to emphasize our tourism then we can attract the world.
We can attract a large part of the world's tourism and provide employment opportunities to millions of youngsters of our country.
Be it government, institutions, society, citizens, all of us are working together to do this.
Let us try to do something in that direction.
My young friends, holidays should come in such a way, I do not like this.
You also think in this direction.
Will you let your holidays, important years of life and its important time go to the same way
I have a idea to think of you.
Can you resolve to add a new thing to your personality in holidays, can you do this
If you do not come to swim, you can pledge in the holidays, learn to swim, cycling does not come, then decide on holidays and I will run a cycle.
Even today, I type the computer with two fingers, can I learn typing
How many skills are there for the development of our personality
Why not learn him
Why not remove some of our shortcomings
Why don ' t we expose our powers
Now imagine and somebody needs a very big class in it, there is no such thing as a trainer, a lot of honey and a lot of big budget.
You should also assume that I will make the best from the waste.
See something and start making it from it.
Namaste Prime Minister, you said in the holidays of the last summer that birds also feel heat, so we should keep in a vessel in water and keep in our balcony or on the roof, so that the birds come and drink water.
I did this work and I was happy, this excuse was my friendship with a lot of birds.
I urge you to repeat this work back in the matter of mind.
And I was not in my mind that today I would say something about this topic but that accomplishment reminded me that last year I was in a soil utensil outside the house for birds.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to Abhi Chaturvedi.
He called me and reminded me of a good work.
Abhi told me that he has been doing this work for a year and many of his birds have become friends.
Mahadevi Verma, the great poet of Hindi, loved the birds very much.
He wrote in his poem - Do not let you go away, fill the courtyard with grains and fill the hood we will sweet and sweet cold water.
Let us also do this thing of Mahadevi ji.
I also congratulate Abhiyan and express my gratitude that you have reminded me of very important things.
Shilpa Kuke from Mysore, he has kept a big sensitive issue for all of us.
He said that those who sell milk near our house, those who sell the newspapers and come to Postman.
Sometimes someone who sells utensils passes through there, those who sell clothes pass.
Have we ever asked them for water in the summer
Have we ever given him water
Shilpa, I am very grateful to you. You have kept a very sensitive topic in a very simple manner.
It is true that the thing is small but if the postman comes to the house in the midst of the heat and we used to drink water then it would like to be good.
Well, this is the nature of India.
But I am grateful to Shilpa that you have served these things.
What is the situation of the market, what is the situation in the mandis, what is the round of good crops these days, what are the useful medicines
Not only this, there is a button in it that connects you directly with agricultural scientists, it connects you with exports.
If you keep your question in front of him, he answers, explains, you can.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters should download this Kisan Facilitation App on their mobile phone.
If you try, do you have something to do with that
And yet, if you feel some shortage then you also complain to me.
But we also have to think of the countrymen that what will happen without water
Is it the time when we have our ponds and our water flowing paths to water in the ponds where the waste and waste or some or the other environment stops coming and the water conservation is slowly decreasing.
Can we prepare those old places once again for excavation, cleaning and more water harvesting
If the water is saved, even in the first rain, if the water is saved, the ponds are filled, our rivers are filled with drains, then even if the rains are left behind, then our loss is less.
This time you must have seen 5 lakh ponds, fields and ponds.
MNREGA has also emphasized on creating assets for water harvesting.
There will be many villages in the country, there will be many progressive farmers, there will be many aware citizens who have done this work.
But still there is a need to do more.
I welcome it.
The misuse of more fertilizer has made our mother earth sick and we are the sons of Mother Earth, children, how can we see our motherland sick
These fertilizers are the same, however the best fertilizers, but if they use more fertilizers then they will become the reason for waste.
The more water will be saved, the more the farmers will benefit, the more the lives will be saved.
My dear countrymen, on 7th April is the World Health Day and this time the world has focused the World Health Day on Beat Diabetes and defeat diabetes.
Diabetes is such a host that he is eager to host every disease.
Once the diabetes enters, a lot of diseases behind this, Kurupi guests enter their homes and body.
It is said that in 2014, there were about six crore diabetes patients in India.
The reason for 3 percent death is that diabetes were found.
And there are two types of diabetes, one type-1, type-II. Type-II is a hereditary, the parents are so that the child gets it.
And due to Type-2 habits, because of age, because of obesity.
The world is worried about diabetes, so 7 stars have been kept in the World Health Day.
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest reason for it.
Physical labor is decreasing.
The name of the sweat is not O-Nishan, it is not going to walk.
Can we do something to defeat diabetes in our personal life by taking some inspiration from 7th
If every citizen of my country is healthy then my India will also be healthy.
Sometimes we do not hesitate to conduct medical check-ups.
And after a very bad situation, it is noticed that Oh, I had a very old diabetes.
On March 24, the world celebrated TB Day.
We know, when I was small, I was afraid to hear the name of TB.
But the number of TB patients is very much compared to the world.
This means that this disease is such that which can be tested soon.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is being done in this direction.
You should check once.
And this disease can go.
Just be the right treatment and the treatment continues till the disease is destroyed.
I would urge you to defeat TB or diabetes.
India has to free us from these diseases.
But it does not happen with government, doctors, medicines until you do it.
And that is why I urge my countrymen to defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, there are many important occasions in the month of April, especially the birthday of Bhimrao Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April.
His 125th birth anniversary was celebrated throughout the country throughout the year.
We are constantly trying to develop these five pilgrimages.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Baba Sahib Ambedkar's birthplace on 14th April this year.
Baba Sahib has given a lot to become a best citizen.
We can pay homage to him by walking on that path and becoming a best citizen.
In a few days, Vikram Samvat will start.
Various states are celebrated separately.
My best wishes to everyone for my New Year.
You can hear at your own time.
You can hear on your mobile phone.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to you all.
The youngster of India takes time to look at the TV to get information about it.
Perhaps there will be no district of India where I have not got the opportunity to visit.
Like earlier, they do not go on the same route, they want to do something new, they want to see something new.
And there is a possibility of a lot of employment through tourism.
And the identity of your personality will increase so much that your confidence will increase.
This will probably be a matter of talk among your colleagues.
My name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
Through this Kisan Facilitation App, if you download it in your mobile phone then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weather in your palm.
My farmer brothers and sisters, for the rest, there has been an opportunity for summer holidays but it becomes an opportunity for the farmer to sweat more.
He waits for rain and before waiting, the farmer gets ready to prepare his farm so that he does not want to waste a drop of rain.
The time for the farmers and the farmers to start the season is very important.
That's the same food, huh
You must worry about him.
But when TB and death were added, we were afraid but now we have become careless about TB.
My dear countrymen, greetings
You must have listened to my mind on the radio but the mind must have been on this thing that the teams of children are starting and some people's tenth-12th teams are probably starting on 1st March.
So you'll have the same thing in your mind.
I also want to join you in this visit.
As much as you are concerned about the health of your children, I am equally concerned.
But if we change our way of watching the exams, then perhaps we can be anxious.
I had said in the last Mann Ki Baat that you must send your experience and suggestions on the Narendra Modi App.
I am glad that teachers, those whose career has been very successful have sent me a lot of things by the students, parents and some thinkers of the society.
Secondly, there were thousands of things that I believe that this is perhaps a very important subject.
But most of us have limited the topic of Ceam to the campus of the school or to the family or to the student.
The suggestions that came on my app seem to have been that these topics of students should continue to be discussed in the country.
Today, I want to talk to my parents, examiners and their teachers in this Mann Ki Baat specially.
I will also tell some of what I have heard, what I have read, what I have been told.
Whatever I think, I will also add.
But I am confident that these 25-30 minutes will be very useful for those students who have to pay their feedback.
I would like to tell you what Bharat Ratna Shriman Sachin Tendulkar has sent to the youth of India: - Namaskar, I am speaking Sachin Tendulkar.
I know that exams are going to start in a few days.
Many of you will also be tense.
My only message is to you that your parents will do the experiments with you, your teachers will do it, your family members will do it.
Wherever you go, everyone will ask how your preparations are going on, how many percents will score you.
I would like to say that I would like to say that you would like to set some targets for yourself and do not come in the security of someone else's execution.
You must work hard but set a realistic achievable target for yourself and try to achieve the target.
So it was very important for me to indulge a solution.
And those targets I used to always try to achieve.
My occupation used to be balle-pay and targets on their own.
I would like to tell you that your thinking is very important.
Positive thoughts will be adopted by positive results.
So you must be positive and you must give good results to the above, I hope it is my best and I would like to give you the best wishes for the exports.
Friends, see what Tendulkar ji is saying.
Don't press it under the burden of execution.
You have to make your future.
You should decide your goal by yourself, decide your own targets - free mind, free thinking, free capability.
Why not compete
Why should we waste our time to compete with others
Why do not we compete with ourselves
Why do not we decide to break all our previous records
You see, no one will be able to stop you from proceeding and when you break your previous record, you will not expect anyone else for happiness and satisfaction.
There will be satisfaction from inside.
Friends, do not consider the examination as a game of marks.
Where did we reach, how much did we reach
Don't be caught in that account.
Life should be linked to a great purpose.
One should walk with a dream and be determined.
These examinations, whether we are going to be right or not, they calculate it
And that is why if these dreams are huge, then the examination will become a festival in itself.
Every examination will be a step to fulfill that great objective.
Every success will become the key to achieving that great goal.
If you take a very big objective and sometimes it will be less than expected, then disappointment will not come.
And we'll have the courage to force, to force, and to try.
Thousands of people who have written me small things from the mobile phone on my app.
Shreya Gupta has emphasized that there is a healthy mind in the healthy body.
You should keep in mind your studies as well as your health so that you can write healthyly in Feam.
Now, on the last day, I will not say that you start punishing and going to run three kilometers, five kilometers.
But one thing is true that how your routine is in particular during the days of Feam.
Anyway, 365 days of our routine should be conducive to our dreams and resolutions.
I agree with one point of Mr. Prabhakar Reddy ji, he has made a special request, should sleep on time and revision early in the morning.
Entrance papers and other things should be reached at the Defence Centre prematurely.
Prabhakar Reddy ji has said this, I probably do not dare to say because I am slightly indifferent to sleep and my sufficient friends also complain to me that you sleep very little.
This is my deficiency, I will also try to fix.
The time to sleep, deep sleep, is as important as your whole day and activity and this is possible.
Otherwise, there is a habit of some people, they keep talking on long telephones before sleeping.
And when I talk about sleeping, do not think that I am asking him to sleep for Feam.
I am talking about sleeping for a stress-free state to give you a good exam at the time of Feam.
I'm not talking about sleeping.
Otherwise, it should not be so that the marks should come down and the mother asked why the son came down, then say that Modi had asked to sleep, so I was asleep.
Do not do so .
I don't believe.
If one or half part of our body suffers a little then you must have seen that the whole body does not feel comfortable.
Not only this, our routine also goes on.
And so we don't consider anything small.
You see, do not entangle yourself in the habit of doing business in what you have ever decided.
Decid, look at it.
You must have seen these two kinds of people.
There is also a negative impact on the consequences of what kind of paper will come in its tension.
On Vishwanathan Anand, he will tell his experience.
You must have seen, their eyes do not even go around.
Sometimes we used to hear, not the incident of Arjun's life, how did he look at the bird's eyes.
When Viswanathan is seen playing in the same way, his eyes are completely visible on a bigger target and it is an expression of peace inside.
It is true that someone should say that there will be peace in the inside, it is difficult to say that but it should be tried.
If you are not talking to friends or you are walking alone, you are walking alone, you are moving a lot of books, you are also shaking lots of books, then it cannot be a peaceful mind.
You imagine that you are standing on the edge of a pond and you see very good things below.
But suddenly if a stone starts moving in the water, then the best thing that was seen below is it
If the water is calm, then things can be seen as deep as possible.
But if the water is disturbed, then there is nothing below.
You will not be able to find the treasure if you have an unhappy mind.
If there is a calm mind then your treasure will emerge in front of you and your treasure will become simple.
Sometimes I try to understand more concentrate and I feel stress within it.
And then I think, no, no, I'm going to relax, I'll be good.
So I have made myself a technology development.
I'm very deep breathing.
I breathe deep.
Three times and five times I breathe deeply, the time goes 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, but then my mind becomes quiet and ready to understand things.
Maybe this is my experience, you may also be able to work.
Rajat Agarwal has told a good thing.
If parents are also read in the house and even if parents are teachers, then they write the entire paper again, tell what you wrote, what happened
Yeah, I made a mistake.
Hey, man, I knew it, but I didn't remember.
We get stuck in it.
Fresh memories of old joy and joy.
Sometimes you have gone somewhere with parents, remember the scenes there.
Just spend half an hour after leaving them.
Rajat ji's talk is really like understanding.
Ramcharitmanas, interpreting him in the present context, he is trying to convey this rites to Sarita in the country and the world.
I am also grateful to revered Murari Bapu that he gave us a very good message.
Friends, I want to tell you another thing today.
I see that this time Yoga has been discussed in the people who have shown me their experiences.
And it is a matter of great happiness for me that somebody whom I meet in the world these days, why don't you get a little time, somebody does something or the other thing about yoga.
Well, Friends, I would like to say just today, start doing yoga from tomorrow morning, it will be injustice to you.
But those who do yoga are at least healthy so do not do it today.
If you do then do it.
But it is true that Yoga is a very big key in the development journey of interference, whether it is in the student life or in the middle of life.
The simple key is simple.
You must pay attention to it.
Yes, if you will be a knowledgeable person of Yoga in your close proximity then you will not have done yoga in the days of Feam, even then you will tell two-four things that you can do in two-five minutes.
Look, if you can
Yes, I have a lot of faith in it.
My young friends, you are very soon to go to the examination hall and you want to sit on your bench at the earliest
Why do you do these things in a hurry
Why not make such a management of your whole day that even if you stop in traffic, we will reach on time.
Otherwise, such things create a new stress.
And one thing is that the time we have got, the question papers that are instruments, sometimes we feel that it will eat our time.
It's not like this, friends.
You should read those structures closely and you will go for two minutes or three minutes or five minutes and there will be no harm.
But with the same paper again, I have the same paper, I have no new questions, I have to deal with so many questions and when I started thinking again, he wrote that when I understood this paper so easily, I read it for the first time that it did not come to me, but I read the same thing again, I noticed that the question has been kept in another way, but this is the same thing I know.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Sometimes the question seems difficult by not understanding the questions.
I assert Yash Nagar that you should read questions twice, read three times, read four times and try to match them with what you know.
It is a matter of happiness for me today that Bharat Ratna and our very respected scientist CNR Rao have emphasized patience.
In very few words, but a very good message has been given to all of us.
Whatever I spend half an hour to say, they say in three minutes.
This is the strength of science and this is the strength of the scientific mind.
I am very grateful to Rao Saheb that he inspired the children of the country.
What they have said is that of determination, integrity, integrity, integrity, integrity, integrity, integrity, integrity and integrity.
If you stay stuck, then fear will also be scared.
And the golden future is waiting for you to do well.
Now a message on my app has been shared by Dabus to his experience.
He said that his family is constantly trying to create a positive atmosphere at the time of Feam and this was also discussed in his fellow families.
Together, a positive environment.
This is true as Sachin ji also said, Positive Approach, Positive Frame of Mind Positive Energy highlights.
Why not at any stage of life, the best examples, the truth events also inspire a lot, give a lot of strength and create a new path at the time of crisis.
We all read about Thomas Elva Edison, the inventor of the Electricity Bulb, in our syllabus.
But today that electricity, that bulb also illuminates the lives of our people.
It is said that failure also contains the possibility of success.
J. K. Ralling is an excellent example that success can be achieved by anyone at any time.
Harry Potter Ceries are popular all over the world today.
But it was not so from the beginning.
How many problems they had to face.
Ralling himself had said that in the difficulties, he used to put all the energy in that work, which really meant for him.
Nowadays, not just the students, the entire family and the entire school and the teacher becomes all of them.
However, without the support system of Parents and Teachers, the situation is not good.
Be it Teacher, Parents, Even Senior Students, together we become a team and move ahead with the same thinking as units and in a planned manner, the examination becomes easier.
Shri Keshav Vaishnav has written to me on the App, he has complained that parents should never put pressure on their children to demand more marks.
Only should be encouraged to prepare.
They should be ready and should worry about it.
Vijay Jindal writes, do not burden the children with their expectations.
This is true.
I don't want to tell Parents more today.
Please do not make pressure.
If he is talking to some of his friends, do not stop.
Make a slight environment, create a positive environment, see how much convenience will be your son or daughter.
We like to join him.
We also want to move ahead with the rapid pace of science.
Curiosity is the mother of science.
All these things should be a simple part of our development journey and this time the theme of the National Science Day is Make in India.
Friends, sometimes successes meet for a long time and when success is achieved then the vision of seeing the world also changes.
Perhaps you might have been very business in the Feam, you might have had many reports that have not been registered in your mind.
But I also want to repeat this to the countrymen.
You must have heard in the past that there has been a huge and important diagnosis in the world of science.
Scientists of the world worked hard, generations came, went on doing something or the other and after about 100 years a success took place.
Gravitational waves were highlighted and detected by the mentorship of our scientists.
This is a very far-reaching success of science.
This discovery not only certifies the theory of our great scientist Einstein of the last century but is considered a great discovery for physics.
But as an Indian, we all are happy that the sons of our country and the promising scientists of our country were also associated with it in the process of searching.
I want to congratulate and congratulate all those scientists today.
In the future, our scientific efforts will continue to move forward.
This kind of system is at two places in the world, India is the third.
The connectivity of India will give this process a new strength and a new momentum.
India will surely become an active partner in the process of this great scientific discovery of human welfare among its limited resources.
Once again I congratulate all the scientists and best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I write a number to you, from tomorrow you can call this number and listen to my mind in your mother tongue.
I also have to give exam tomorrow.
125 crore Indians are going to take my expedition.
But yes, you must have seen, I must have heard how healthy I am, how much self-confidence I am.
Just, tomorrow become my exam, start yourself together.
And if we all succeed, then the country will also be successful.
Friends, I convey my best wishes and best wishes to you all.
Be free from the stress of success and failure, move forward from the free mind.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2015
I look at this portal and from Pune, Mr. Ganesh V.
Yes, we have to change it according to the requirements of India. The poor person works somewhere, he has physical labour, but a young man can make a thing through innovation to make the poor a little comfortable in the wages and I also consider it as a start-up and I will ask the bank to help such a young man, I will also tell him that he will be able to move ahead with courage.
And then I thought that it seems that from the eyes we feel that it is disabled, but it feels that it has an extra power, extra power. And then I thought that why not we should use the word Divyang in place of the disabled in our country. These are those people who have an organ or more organ in which divine power is communication, which we don't have the common body. I feel like this word. Can my countrymen propagate the word Divyang in place of the habit of disability
Send me to this portal that I would like to think about the duties of the younger generation of my country. On January 26, when we celebrate Republic Day, can we observe the statues of all the great men and women in our city by the citizens, by the children of schools and colleges, the cleanliness of that complex, the best sanitation and the best adornment on January 26
Dear countrymen, Namaste.
During the sacred festival of Deepawali, you will have celebrated holidays very well.
There will also be an opportunity to go somewhere.
And with new zeal and enthusiasm, business jobs have also started.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have also started.
Festival has its own importance in social life.
Sometimes festivals work to fill wounds, sometimes festivals give new energy.
But sometimes when the crisis comes at this time of the festival, it becomes more painful, and it seems painful.
There are frequent natural calamities coming from every corner of the world.
Neither have you ever heard nor had you thought about such natural calamities.
We are now feeling how fast the impact of climate change is growing.
In our country, in the past, the kind of rains and the kind of rains and long rains that have been damaged in Tamil Nadu, especially in Tamil Nadu and the states have also been affected.
Many people were killed.
I convey my condolences to all those families in this hour of crisis.
State governments gather with full force in relief and rescue work.
The central government also always works together with shoulders.
Now a team of Indian government has gone to Tamil Nadu.
But I am confident that despite this crisis on the power of Tamil Nadu, it will start moving forward once again at a rapid pace and will continue to play the role he plays in moving the country forward.
But when they look at the problems around, we need to make a lot of changes in it.
15 years ago, the natural calamity used to be a part of a agriculture department, because then more natural calamities i.e. famine was limited to here.
Today its form has changed.
After Nepal's earthquake, I spoke to Pakistan's Prime Minister Mr. Nawaz Sharif.
There's a good beginning.
I got Lakhvinder Singh's phone from Jalandhar in Punjab today.
I am speaking to Lakhwinder Singh, Punjab District Jalandhar.
We do organic farming here and guide a lot of people to cultivate.
There is a question of how the people who set fire to these fields, how to guide them to the people, how bad the microbes who are microbes to the mother of the earth and how much this pollution is happening in Delhi, in Haryana, in Punjab.
Lakhwinder Singh ji was very happy to hear your message.
One is happy that you are a organic farming farmer.
And they themselves do organic farming. Not only this, you understand the problem of farmers.
And your concern is correct but it is not just in Punjab, Haryana.
This is the habit of our people all over India and traditionally we go on the way to burn the remains of our crops.
Secondly, what are the measures, it was not even trained.
And when the impact of this crisis began to come towards the cities then a little sound started to be heard.
But the pain you have expressed is correct.
But this is not the truth.
The remains of the crop are also very precious.
They themselves have a biological manure.
Secondly, due to this burning, the upper layer of the earth burns.
For my farmer brothers and sisters, think that our bones should be strong, our heart should be strong, our kidneys should be good, but what will happen if the skin above the body burns
By the same way, the remains of these crops do not just burn the knees, it burns the skin of the mother Earth.
The upper layer of our land burns, which pushes our fertile land towards death.
And that's why he should make positive efforts.
This knot is once again dumped into the ground, even then it becomes fertilizer.
Or if you put a little water by putting a pit in a pit and putting a little water, then it comes by becoming a best kind of biological manure.
I got the opportunity to interact with the farmer brothers who cultivated banana once.
And they told me a great experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate banana crops and when banana crops were over, they had to spend Rs. 5,000, 10,000 and 15,000 per hectare to clean the banana lips.
And till the people who picked it up, they did not come with the tractor-vactor, they were standing like that.
However, some farmers proved the pieces of 66, 8-8 inch of that kitchen and buried it on the ground.
So the experience came to light that there is so much water in this banana knot that if there is a tree, if there is a plant, if there is a crop then there is no need to get out for three months.
Those who had to spend the cleaning of the knee earlier, today the demand for the knee has increased.
How much small experiment can be beneficial, this is not less than our farmer brother.
Dear countrymen, International Day of Persons with Disabilities will remember the entire world on December 3.
Last time in Mann Ki Baat, I had discussed the organization.
I had also talked about the helpline of the NEET for the organization and I was told that after that, the phone calls increased by about 7 times.
Very well-known people, including film actress Ravina Tandon, are associated with it.
Organ Contion can save valuable lives.
Angadan comes in a way with immortality.
When an organ goes from one body to another, that organ gets a new life but that life gets a new life.
What can be the best donation from this.
I am confident that widespread awareness will also increase in this area and in the true sense, the needy will get the best as this help cannot be received from anywhere till no one donates.
As I said earlier, the 3rd December is celebrated as Disabled Day.
Physically and mentally handicapped people are also rich in an unprecedented courage and capability.
Sometimes pain occurs when sometimes they ridicule.
Sometimes the feeling of compassion and mercy is expressed.
But if we change our vision and change the vision of them then these people can inspire us to live.
Some can inspire to pass.
If we get a little trouble, then we sit to cry.
Then remembers that my crisis is very small, how does it live
And that is why all these are the source of inspiration for us.
His will power, his way of fighting with his life and his ability to convert the crisis into capabilities.
Javed Ahmed, I want to tell him today.
4042 years of age.
In 1996, Javed Ahmed was shot by terrorists in Kashmir.
He lost a part of intestine and intestine.
Serius Natural has become a spinal injury.
The ability to stand on his feet went forever, but Javed Ahmed did not give up.
Terrorism injury could not even scare them.
His own responsibilities, but the biggest thing is that without any reason an innocent person has suffered so much trouble, youth has been in danger, but no resentment, no anger, no anger, no anger, this crisis, Javed Ahmed also turned into a sensitivity.
He dedicated his life to social service.
The body does not accompany but for 20 years they have been immersed in children's studies.
How did the infrastructure improve for physically handicapped people
How to develop arrangements for disability in public places, government offices
They are working on it.
Is Javed's life not enough to inspire us in every corner of India
I specifically remember the life of Javed Ahmed, his penance and his dedication on 3rd December.
In the absence of time, even though I am talking about Javed, but in every corner of India, lamps of such inspiration are burning.
They are giving new light to live, showing the way.
On December 3, there is an opportunity to remember everyone and inspire them.
Our country is so huge.
There are many things in which we depend on governments.
Be it a person of the middle class, a person of the lower middle class, a poor, a Dalit, afflicted, afflicted, deprived, afflicted and deprived, there is a continuous relationship with the government system.
And as a citizen, sometimes a bad experience comes from some government Babu in life.
And that evil experience changes our vision of looking at the government system throughout the life.
There is a truth in it but sometimes lakhs of people sitting in this government do good work with service, dedication and dedication which never come to our sight.
Sometimes we do not even know, because it is so simple that we do not know that any government system, any government officer is doing this work.
In our country, ASA workers who are networking across the country.
Sometimes I have not heard about the ASA workers among the people of India, nor have you heard.
But when I am the world famous family entrepreneur of the Bilgates Foundation, his success in the world has become an example.
We had given joint Padma Vibhushan to both of these billgates and Milindagates last time.
They do very social work in India.
Whatever his retirement time and life have earned, he is spending in working for the poor.
Whenever they come, they meet and whoever has got the opportunity to work with the ASA workers, they appreciate them so much and they have so much to say that what kind of dedication is the dedication of the ASHA workers.
He explains how much enthusiasm is to learn new things.
In the past, the Orissa Government gave special respect to an ASA Worker on Independence Day.
A small village of Balasore district of Orissa, Tendagaon is a hope worker and the entire population there is a scheduled tribe.
And there is an area affected by malaria.
And Jamuna Mani Singh, a hope worker of this village, decided that now I will not let anyone die from malaria in this village.
If he goes home and goes to know about a small fever then reach.
Based on the primary arrangements taught to him, it is to be treated for treatment.
Emphasis on every house using insecticide mosquitoes.
As your own child sleeps properly and as much as the care should be done, the ASA worker Jamuna Mani Singh continues to work with complete dedication to avoid the entire village mosquitoes.
And he competed with malaria, prepared to fight the entire village.
So how many Jamuna Mani will be.
There will be millions of people who will be around us.
We will see them with a bit of respect.
Such people become the great strength of our country.
How do the happiness and misery of the society become big companions
I salute all such ASA workers through Jamuna Mani.
I urge you to see this.
Not only this, see others also read it and maybe you want to add such things.
Positive power is the biggest energy.
Discuss books and if a enthusiastic young man goes to schools and neighbours about these books and tell the children of the eighth, nineth and tenth grade that this happened here.
So you can actually become a social teacher.
Let me invite you to join the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worried about climate change.
There is also concern about climate change, global warming, dagger-dagger and it is getting approval as a standard before doing every work.
The temperature of the earth should no longer increase.
It is also the responsibility of everyone.
I had once said that on the night of Purnima, the street lights should be closed and bathed in the full moon light for hours.
You should experience the light of that moon.
When a friend had sent me a link and I got the opportunity to see him, I decided to tell you this thing too.
Noorjahan in Kanpur does not seem to have got the privilege of reading more.
But one such work is doing which perhaps no one would have thought.
He is working to give light to the poor using solar energy.
He is fighting war with darkness and illuminating his name.
He has set up a committee of women and has planted a solar energy lantern plant and gives a lantern at a rent of Rs. 100 a month.
About Rs. 3-4 per day is spent but there is light in the entire house and it works throughout the day with solar energy in that plant.
Now see what big people of the world would have done for climate change but one Noorjah may inspire everyone.
And anyway, Noorjahan means to illuminate the world.
The light is spreading through this work.
I congratulate Noorjahan and I also congratulate EET because he presented this work in front of the country and the world in a small corner of Kanpur.
Many congratulations.
Abhishek ji Thank you.
What you sent to me from Gorakhpur
Prime Minister MRA Yojana under the ununded.
Those who do not get the money get the money.
By the way, the speed at which I want to go is yet to come.
But in such a short span of time, about 66 lakh people got 42 thousand crore rupees from the Pradhan Mantri MRA Yojana.
Whether it is a dhobi, a dog, a newspaper seller, a milk seller.
Small businessmen and I am happy to note that there are about 24 lakh women in these 66 lakhs.
And most of these helpers are the people of SC, ST and B who work hard and try to run the family with respect to their feet.
Abhishek himself has told his enthusiasm.
I've got a lot of news.
Someone told me now that there is no Shailesh in Mumbai.
He got a loan of Rs. 8.5 lakh from the bank under MRA scheme.
And they started sewage dress, cleaning business.
I had said about the time of my Swachhta Abhiyan that the Swachhta Abhiyan is such that it will create new entrepreneurs.
And Shailesh Bhosle did it.
They have brought a tanker and I was told that in such a short span of time, they returned the bank to the bank.
After all, this is the intention of our MRA scheme.
Someone told me about Bhopal's Mamta Sharma that she got 40 thousand rupees from the bank from the Prime Minister MRA Yojana.
He is working to make a batuva.
And the batuva was made but earlier it used to bring money with more interest and it used to run the business with great difficulty.
Now due to his good amount of money, he made his work very good.
And earlier, due to additional interest and due to the reasons he had spent more than one thousand rupees every month due to the coming of this money in his hands.
And his family also started developing a good business gradually.
But I would like to be more propaganda of the scheme.
All our banks should be more sensitive and help more smaller people.
Indeed, these people run the economy of the country.
Only those who do small work are the economic power of the country's meaning.
We want to emphasize that.
It's good, but it's better to do.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had discussed Ek Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat.
These are the things that should continue to be aware of social life.
Rashtriyama Jagrayam Vyasam International Vigilance is the preservation of the Liberty country, this ritual must continue.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat I want to give it the form of a scheme.
MyGov had asked for suggestions on him.
How should the construction of the programme be
What's the logo
How did people's participation increase
I said for all suggestions.
I was told that a lot of suggestions are coming.
But I expect more suggestions.
Any big preies have also been declared.
You also apply your creative mind.
How can this mantra of unity integrity be made an India-Shreshtha Bharat connecting this mantra to each Indian
What is the plan, what is the program
Be it living, glorious, vibrant and simple to connect everyone.
What should the government do
What will the Vivil Society do
There may be many things.
You enjoy wearing clothes, but I will be urging you to exercise.
I will urge you to keep the body fit for some time and some time, this good weather will be used for exercise.
And to create an atmosphere in the family, the family will have a festival, it is an hour to do all this together.
So there is a good weather, then there will be a good habit.
Once again, I got the privilege of joining you all with Mann Ki Baat.
Today, the fifth one-day match between India and South Africa is going to play in Mumbai.
This series is named Gandhi Mandela series.
And that is why the importance of the last match has increased further.
My best wishes to all the players.
Today, I would like to congratulate the friends of Kannur Centre of All India Radio.
Congratulations are to be given so that when I started talking about the mind, many people went to join him.
In it, a 12th student of Kerala was associated with Shraddha Thamban.
I once again have to talk about Kerala today.
The students of Saint Mary Per-Primary School of Chittor, Kerala have sent me a letter.
The letter is special in many ways.
One, these girls have made a picture of Mother India with their thumb mark, on a very big cloth.
He has sent me the picture of India and Mother India's map.
Earlier I was surprised why he made a map of India with his thumb mark.
However, when I read his letter, I realized how good he had given a symbolic message.
These are those girls who have just tried to awaken the Prime Minister, it is not so.
They are also trying to make people aware in their respective areas and their mission is Angadan.
They are conducting public awareness campaigns for organ donation.
He has also done drama stages by visiting many places so that the understanding of Angadan spread among the people.
Angadan became a trend and tendency.
These girls have written to me in a letter that you should appeal to the people about organ donation in your mind.
They say Angadan should be made a festival.
These days I have a lot of messages on phone call.
Devesh of Delhi has also given me a similar message.
Every year one lakh eyesight is needed.
The organ of the body can be donated on death in road accidents.
Some laws are also very confused.
States have also tried to guide in this direction.
Some states have made a very good effort to reduce the paperwork and accelerate it.
Today, I can say that the organ donation is in the Tamil Nadu Advance Line in the field of Angadan.
Several social institutions, many NGOs are doing a very good job in this direction.
To promote organ transplant, the National Organisation and Tissue Transplant Organization (NTO) has been set up.
A 247 Helpline 1800114770 is also available.
And it has been said to us that the joy of renouncing Tykten Bhunjitha is the best description of this mantra.
In the past, we all had seen on TV that a poor stalwart, Hawker and his wife were transplanted in Delhi's G.B. Pant Hospital.
And it was brought from Lucknow to Delhi by making a special effort.
And that operation was successful.
A life survived.
Angadan Mahadan
We should realise this feeling of Ten Tykten Bhujitha and we must emphasize this.
Dear countrymen, we have just celebrated Navratri and Vijayadashmi.
And after a few days, the festival of Diwali will also be celebrated.
Eid is also celebrated, Ganesh-Chaturthi is also celebrated.
For the first time, such a big scale is being organized on the land of India.
Leaders of Chavan African countries and unions have been invited.
Africa's largest convention is being held outside Africa.
The relations between India and Africa are deep.
The population of India is the same as the population of African countries.
And if we meet both then we are one-third of the world's population.
And they say millions of years ago, this was the same territory.
Later, these two pieces were divided from the Indian Ocean.
There is a lot of similarity between us.
And about 27 lakh people of India have lived in these countries for a long time.
India has economic relations with African countries, cultural relations, diplomatic relations, but India plays a very important role in training the younger generation of the most African countries.
Over 25,000 African students have been studying in India.
And today there are leaders of many African countries, they have read in India.
So how deep we have.
And from that point of view, this summit is very important.
Generally, when the summit is held, then the heads of different countries are found.
Similarly, there will be a meeting of heads in a summit.
Look, it is our endeavour to meet the people too.
And this time, the Government of India, especially the RD Ministry, has done a very good programme.
The programme was organised between the children of BSC, the programme for writing poems, the programme for increasing their participation.
About 16 hundred schools participated in it.
There were also schools outside India and India.
And thousands of schoolchildren wrote things that emphasized the Indo-Africa relations.
On the other hand, Mahatma Gandhi's birthplace from Porbandar to Memorials of Mahatma, an exhibition, Mobile Exhibition is visiting Northern States from Porbandar to Delhi on October 29.
Millions of schoolchildren saw this exhibition, the villagers saw it.
A lot of compositions came in the competition that took place.
My attention goes towards a composition, I love, so I want to tell you.
But the opportunity of connecting the people is clearly visible to us.
I congratulate the dignity, the children who participated in it, more than 1600 schools and the RM Ministry.
On August 15, I had made a proposal regarding the MP Adarsh Gram Yojana for the last time.
After that many MP friends fulfilled this work.
Stay with a big mind.
Last month there was a workshop in Bhopal.
In which these ideal villages are being developed, the heads of the village, the collector of that place, some MPs of that place, some of the Indian government and the state government, all of them together discussed the issue of Adarsh Gram Yojana.
Under the influence of these leftist militants, many areas have been wasted there.
However, our MPs are very senior, sometimes there have been deputy-speakers in Parliament, Mr. Karia Munda ji and tribals have spent their lives.
He chose Parsi Gram Panchayat of Kunti district of Jharkhand to make an ideal village.
I congratulate Mr. Karia Munda ji, the Honourable MP.
That's what I got from Andhra.
Andhra MP Ashok Gajapati Raju ji himself was consumed in the scheme of Adarsh Village and he chose Puri Gram Panchayat for Adarsh Village through Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
The rest of the arrangements are being made, but they have done a big special innovative work.
Shriman Ruwala ji started the Kurtai Kut Sugarcane Festival in the village on 11th March.
People from all the areas got together in it.
How can the village be made a centre of economic activity, how can the market of the village be produced
His effort to build an ideal village as well as a self-sufficient village is indeed an officer of congratulations.
My dear brothers and sisters, how can it be that there is no talk of cleanliness
Savita Rai has sent me a message from Mumbai through a telephone, every year we clean our homes to prepare for Diwali.
We should make this Diwali clean along with our homes as well as the environment outside us and keep it clean even after Diwali.
They have attracted attention to the right thing.
I would like to remind you of my dear countrymen, after the festival of Diwali last year, the media of our country, especially the media, launched a big campaign and whenever the firecrackers had fallen after Diwali, they showed all the things and he said that this is not right.
So your point is true that we should do whatever we worry before the festival even after the festival.
Every public program should be done.
And today I specially want to congratulate all the media world of India.
India awards and I was also watching how many kinds of activities are going on.
How people are working themselves as a One Like One Mission for this.
How many places are there in our country which have been kept so clean.
All these things were exposed and I congratulated the commendable work of India TV Group at that time.
However, since the mission of Swachhta Abhiyan has been launched, I have seen that Shriman Ramuji Rao from Andhra, Telangana to Tendu and especially Shriman Ramuji Rao is very old but his enthusiasm is not less than any young man.
And he added about 51 lakh children from about 55-56 thousand schools to this work in Andhra and Telangana.
Whether it is public places, stations, religious places, hospitals, parks, many places have been campaigning for cleanliness.
Now these news in itself gives a philosophy of the power to realize the dream of a clean India.
ABP News has started a programme in my name and has done a highlight to train the citizens of the country by making them aware about cleanliness.
There are hundreds of channels and thousands of newspapers in our country, everybody, I am unable to take the name of all but I have launched this campaign.
And that is why Savita Rai ji has suggested that today the whole country is considering this thing as its own and it is moving forward.
From Meghalaya, our Governor, Mr. Shanmuganathan, has written a chit to me and by writing a chitty, I have mentioned the Mavalyannong village of Meghalaya.
He has written that for the last several years, this village has taken up a pledge of cleanliness and almost every generation is fully dedicated to this sanitation.
And it is said that a few years ago, he got the award as the cleanest village of Asia.
This is the fact that we all believe that our country will definitely be clean.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will be able to proudly say 1. 25 billion countrymen. See, we have freed our mother India from dirt.
My dear countrymen, I had told the Red Fort on August 15 that there are some things where corruption has been done home.
When the poor person goes for a small job, no one knows what he has to suffer and how the broker's group grabs the money from him.
I have never heard that there is a psychologist in the world who tests a person completely in a minute or two minute interview.
And with this idea, I had announced that why not we have a small piercing job, there we should end the tradition of interview.
My dear young friends, I would like to proudly say today that the government has completed the entire process and the non-gained posts of Group D, Group C and Group B of the Central Government will no longer be interviewed for recruitment and interview.
It will be implemented on January 1, 2016.
We will not interfere in the process where the process is going on, but, it will be implemented from January 1, 2016.
So my best wishes to all young friends.
Well, in the last budget, we had declared an important scheme.
In our country, gold has become a part of social life in a way.
Gold has been considered as the medium of economic security.
The keys of the crisis time are considered to be gold.
Gold can be the economic property of the country and every Indian should contribute to it.
Today, I am glad that in the budget, in the festival of Diwali and when Dhanteras and people buy gold especially on that day, we are going to launch important schemes before that.
We have brought the Gold Monetisation Scheme.
Under this, you can deposit your gold bank and the bank will give you interest on it as you deposit your money and get interest.
Earlier we used to keep in the gold locker and we had to pay the locker's rent.
Now keep the gold bank and the money bank will give you interest.
Say the countrymen, can now become gold property or can not be made
Whether gold can be converted into a living force from Head-Money or not
Just this is what we have to do. You give me along.
Now do not keep gold in the house.
One more thing is that in Sovereign Gold Bonds you don't have a golden ladder in your hands.
So you will get two and a half thousand rupees instead of that paper.
So we are starting it.
Where to keep gold, his concern will be removed, and there will be no one to steal the paper.
So I will keep this scheme with security guarantee in front of the countrymen in the coming weeks.
I am happy to tell you that we are also bringing Gold ueen.
Ashok Chakrawala Gold Oin. Independence was almost 70 years old, but till now we have been using the Foreign World Oin or the Gold Bullion Bars.
At the same time, the world vision of 20 grams will also be available for the people.
I am confident that the new scheme will bring a new change in the direction of economic development and I will get your support.
My dear countrymen, on October 31, the birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
Remembering Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, the map of the whole of India comes out.
This great man has contributed a lot to India's unity.
Iron has introduced its strength as men and men.
We will pay homage to Sardar Saheb, but he had a dream of uniting India.
Geographically, he showed tax, but the mantra of unity must be the medium of our thinking, behaviour, expression.
Many creeds, many sects, many dialects, many castes, many environments, how many diversity our country and these diversity are our beauty.
If there was no diversity then perhaps we cannot do the beauty we are proud of.
And therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, goodwill, unity are the herbs of development.
Over the last several years, on 31st October, there are programmes of Run for Unity in many corners of the country.
I have heard that this time also its plans are being made around, people are preparing for a race for unity with enthusiasm.
The race for unity is the race for development in true sense.
In the second sense, the guarantee of development race is also a race for unity.
Let's pay homage to Sardar Sahib.
Move forward the mantra of unity.
Dear brothers and sisters, Now all of you will be engaged in preparations for Diwali and cleanliness will be done in the house.
New things will be purchased.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated separately in every corner of our country.
I extend my best wishes to you for the sacred festival of Deepawali.
But, in the days of Diwali, some accidents also come into mind.
My dear countrymen, I have to visit Britain on the second day of Deepawali.
I am very excited for my visit to Britain this time.
The Government of India and the State Governments also give scholarships to such sections of society as Dalits, tribals, backwards and promising children who go abroad.
I am confident that when such children of India go to the UK, this place of Baba Saheb Ambedkar will become a pilgrimage for him, it will become an inspiration land and learn something in life but later live for the country, this message was given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
And that is why I am telling you that in my visit to Britain, I am excited, the subject had been confused for several years and now the building becomes the property of 125 crore Indians and the name of Baba Saheb Ambedkar is connected, you can imagine how much pleasure the people like me will be.
I will also get another opportunity in London, unveil the statue of Lord Vishweshwar.
Several years ago, the work done by Lord Vishweshwar for democracy and for women is a really studying aspect of the world.
The dedication of the statue of Lord Vishweshwar on the land of London is an excellent example of how long the great men of India used to think in themselves centuries ago.
So you know that when such incidents are connected then the mind of all our countrymen becomes thrilled.
My dear countrymen, you are associated with Mann Ki Baat.
Through telephone, I get your suggestions through MyGov.
Akashwani is also discussed about your letters.
There is talk of calling government officials.
Some people write their problems, there is also an attempt to solve the problems.
In a country like India, we should learn many languages.
I have got the privilege of learning some languages but yet there are so many languages that where can I learn
But still I am grateful to All India Radio that they broadcast this matter in the regional language of every state at 8 pm.
Even if that voice is of someone else, but the matter is of my mind.
Last time I was completing one year today we are entering the new year.
My dear countrymen once again convey my best wishes.
Jai Hind
Mann Ki Baat, September 2015
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all
I do not consider it bad, I see that the Parliament of the country is also discussing for the sanitation of India and on the other hand, on the one hand the Parliament and the child of this country should talk about cleanliness, on the other hand what could be the privilege of the country, on the other hand this movement is going on, the ideas and the environment of hatred towards filth have come up and there is an awareness towards cleanliness - it will compel the governments to work, it will do it.
Institutions of local Swaraj - be it Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat, municipality, municipality, municipality or state - everybody has to work on this movement. We have to move ahead with the shortcomings and this India will be celebrated in 2019 when we will celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we will work towards fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi and you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
And I was surprised that the child, the entire Gita, was a very poor family daughter of Sadavrat Patel, a resident of Sundarpur, Varanasi, but the biggest thing I felt was that when I asked him, he used to interpret him, he used to define him in English, he used to define him in Hindi. I asked his father, he was speaking at the age of five.
Say, we don't even know. So I said, and what is the situation in studies, only the Gita reads and does something
Once again, I have got the opportunity to come amongst you to talk about mind.
In the remote south, people are colored in the festival of Onam and yesterday the whole country celebrated the holy festival of Rakshabandhan.
Government of India has implemented several new schemes for social security for the common man.
I am glad that in a very short time, in a wide range, all of them have accepted these schemes.
I had made a small request that on the festival of Rakshabandhan, we should give this security scheme to our sisters.
I have come to know that eleven crore families have been associated with this scheme since the start of the scheme.
And I was also told that nearly half of the benefits have been given to mothers and sisters.
I consider it auspicious sign.
I also convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious festival of Rakshabandhan.
Today, when I am talking to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken on a large scale a year ago.
I also saw the riches of the poor.
He had to open an account with ero balance but the poor had saved and saved the amount of Rs.
The mainstream of the economy is also the banking sector and this system has reached the poor's house and has also emphasized the scheme of bank-friendly.
Today more than 1. 25 lakh bank friends are working across the country.
Young people have also got employment.
And now thousands of people have become entitled to take overdraft under this Jan Dhan Yojana.
And the poor can get money from the bank.
Once again, I congratulate all the concerned and urge all the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters who have opened the bank accounts that you do not let the relationship break with the bank.
This bank is yours, you should not leave it now.
I have brought you, now it is your job to hold him.
Our accounts should be active.
But in a very short span of time, the enlightened and all my citizen brothers and sisters of Gujarat took over the situation.
He played an active role in preventing the situation from deteriorating and once again went to Gujarat on the path of peace.
Peace, unity, brotherhood is the right path and we have to walk on shoulder to shoulder on the path of development.
Development is the solution of our problems.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the scholars of the Sufi tradition.
They got an opportunity to listen to them.
And I tell you the truth that the kind of experience, the way I got the opportunity to listen to them, in a way a music is playing.
Their words were selected, their way of conversation, i.e. the generosity in the Sufi tradition, the harmony in which there is a musical rhythm, all of them were experienced in the middle of these scholars.
I liked it very good.
Perhaps the world has become the most necessary to bring the correct form of Islam to the world.
I am confident that the Sufi tradition that is associated with love and generosity will reach this message far and wide, which will benefit humanity, will also benefit Islam.
And I also tell others why we do not believe in any sect, but sometimes we should understand the Sufi tradition.
In the coming days, I will get another opportunity, and I consider this invitation as my fortune.
In India, scholars from many countries of the world are coming to Bodhgaya and are going to discuss global issues related to humanity, I have also received an invitation and I am happy that those people have invited me to come to Bodhgaya.
India's first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru went to Bodh Gaya.
I am going to get the opportunity to visit Bodhgaya with these scholars from all over the world. It is a very happy moment for me.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to tell you the point of mind specially today.
I have already mentioned this topic in Mann Ki Baat.
You must have heard, I must have heard in Parliament, you must have heard in public meetings, you must have heard in the matter of mind.
Every time I have been telling you one thing that the government's mind is open about the controversy over the And Acquisition Act.
I am ready to accept any suggestion of the interest of the farmers, I have been saying this again and again.
This means that my government was formed and the situation before that has been re-instituted.
But one work was incomplete and that was 13 such points which had to be completed in a year and that is why we had brought it in the ordinance but in these disputes, the matter was also confused.
We are implementing the 13 points of the farmers, the 13 points of which the farmers are going to get direct benefits, the 13 points of the farmers are being implemented under the rules so that there is no harm to the farmers, there is no economic loss and therefore we are fulfilling the 13 points that were left in the earlier law and I assure my farmer brothers and sisters that Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan is not a slogan for us, this is our mantra - the welfare of the village, the poor farmers - and only then we had said on 15th August that not just the Agriculture Department but the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, whose decision we have taken very fast.
I have to say another thing that two days ago, fifty years of the 1965 war took place and whenever it comes to the war of 1965, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is very natural to remember Jai-Jawan, Jai-Kisan mantra.
And it is very natural to remember all those martyrs who keep the tricolor flag of India and their beauty.
I salute all the stakeholders of the victory of the 65 war.
I salute the heroes.
And the events of such history continue to inspire us.
The way I had the opportunity to meet the people of the Sufi tradition last week, it was a pleasant experience.
I got the opportunity to talk to the dignitaries of the country for hours.
They got the opportunity to hear and I am happy that in the field of science, India is doing excellent work in many directions.
Our scientists are actually doing excellent work.
Now we have an opportunity to bring these amendments to the common man.
How to convert the principles into equipment
How to add Lab to Hand
It has to move forward as an opportunity.
I also got many new information.
I can say that it was also a very inspiring and academic for me.
And I saw that many young scientists were telling them with enthusiasm, how dreams were visible in their eyes.
And when I had said in Mann Ki Baat last time that our students should move forward towards science.
After this meeting, I feel that there are many opportunities and possibilities.
I keep coming many letters from the citizens.
From Thane, Mr. Parimal Shah has written to me on MyGov.
Emphasis on reforms in the education sector.
I also have to tell my young friends one thing that I had told the Red Fort on August 15 why this interview for lower level jobs
Everyone runs, and perhaps this is also one of the reasons for corruption at the lower level.
And I had said on August 15 that I want freedom below one level from the tradition of Interview.
I am happy that in such a short span of time, it has been 15 days but the government is moving forward very fast.
Information is being sent and the decision will now be implemented that small jobs will be discharged from the interview rounds.
The poor will not have to run for recommendation.
There will be no deployment, no corruption.
These days, guests from many countries of the world have come to India.
For health, especially for mother mortality and infant mortality rate, 24 countries of the world together contemplated in India's land for their action plan.
This was the first time outside the United States, in some other country.
And it is true that even today, in our country, about 50,000 mothers and 13 lakh children die every year at the time of delivery and immediately after that.
This is worrying and scared.
Well, the improvement is quite enough.
India has also started to appreciate internationally, yet this figure is not less.
As we got rid of polio, titness in the death of mothers and infants also got rid of it.
The world has accepted it.
But we still have to save our mothers, save our newborn children.
Brothers and sisters, Nowadays there is news of dengue.
It is true that dengue is dangerous, but its defense is very easy.
And what I am talking about Swachh Bharat is directly linked to it.
We see advertising on T, but our attention does not go.
Advertisement is printed in the newspaper but our attention is not taken.
There are ways to keep cleanliness from pure water in small things at home.
These things are getting widespread public education but we don't care and sometimes it seems that we live in a very good house, we are very good and we don't know that we are filled with water and somewhere we invite dengue.
I will urge all of you that we should not allow death to be so cheap.
Life is very precious.
The indifference of water, apathy on cleanliness, it becomes the cause of death, it is not right.
There are free check facilities available for dengue at around 514 centers across the country.
As soon as it has been time, it is useful to protect life and cooperation with you all is very important in this.
And cleanliness should be of great importance.
These days, festivals are celebrated in our country in a way from Raksha Bandhan to Diwali.
Why not add every festival to cleanliness now
You see rituals will become nature.
My dear countrymen, today I have to tell you a good news. I always say that now we will not get the opportunity to die for the country but we have got the privilege of living for the country.
Both of these brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
Race Cross America is a cycle-race in the United States, it is very difficult and is about four thousand eight hundred kilometers long race.
This year these two brothers won this race.
Look, how everyone is trying to move forward to take the country forward.
And this is the fact that when you hear such incidents, then the chest goes away.
Sometimes due to experiment, we injustice to our youth.
And the older generation always feels that the new generation does not understand anything and I understand that this series has been going on for centuries.
The experience about my youth is different.
Sometimes talk to the youth, then we also get to learn a lot.
I have met many youngsters who say, "Brother, I have been fasting in life.
Some people say that I have kept a cycle day in a week.
It's good for my health too.
And I also feel very happy to be my young man.
Nowadays bicycle runs in many cities in our country and people who promote bicycle are also very much.
But these are good efforts to protect the environment and improve health.
And today, when two youths of my country hoisted the flag in the US, I liked to mention the direction in which the youth of India think.
I would like to congratulate the Government of Maharashtra specially today.
I'm glad.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar - The land of Indu Mill of Mumbai - The case was hanging for a long time to build his memorial.
The new government of Maharashtra completed this work and now Baba Saheb Ambedkar's magnificent monument will be built there, which will inspire us to work for Dalits, victims, exploited and deprived.
But at the same time, where Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar lived in London - 10, King Henry Road, that house has now been bought.
When Indians traveling around the world go to London, the memorial that Baba Saheb Ambedkar is going to be built by the Maharashtra government there will become our inspiration.
I congratulate the Government of Maharashtra for the sadness and pride of both these efforts to honour Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
My dear brothers and sisters, before the next Mann Ki Baat comes, you must tell me your ideas because I believe that democracy runs with public participation.
The country can move forward by mixing the shoulder with the shoulder.
My best wishes to you.
This year the rain has started well.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will definitely help in sowing kharif.
And a happy thing has come to me and I am very happy.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
The poor should need pulses, there should be a little oil in vegetables etc. to eat.
I congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for this.
My dear countrymen, 26th July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The country's farmer's relationship is as much as that of the country's youth.
In the Kargil war, one of our soldiers was heavy on hundreds of enemies.
I salute those brave soldiers who foil the efforts of the enemies by not careful of their lives.
The war of Kargil was not fought on the borders only, in every city of India, in every village, this war was contributed.
This war fought for those mothers and sisters whose young son or brother was fighting enemies in Kargil.
The daughters fought, with whose hands, the henna of Pehar was not landed.
And therefore, today, on Kargil Vijay Diwas, I bow down to all our soldiers.
On 26th July, I consider it slightly important as we started MyGov on 26th July in a few months after the formation of our government in 2014.
Our resolve to increase people-to-people participation in democracy, to connect people to the work of development and I am happy to say this after a year, about two crore people have seen MyGov.
Nearly five and a half lakh people made arrangements and the most happy thing is that more than fifty thousand people suggested the PM applications, they removed the time and used it to be important.
Now the matter is small, but neither anybody in the government came to this attention, nor was it thought.
But on the suggestion of brother Akhilesh Vajpayee, the government seriously considered and today this system was implemented for our disabled brothers and sisters.
Today, those people who are formed, tag-lines are formed, the programme is composed, the policy is formed and MyGov has a lot of positive suggestions.
A new rash air is experienced in the governance system.
A new consciousness is experienced.
These days, I have started suggesting MyGov what I should speak on August 15.
Suchitra Raghwachari from Chennai, he has sent a lot of suggestions.
Speaking on daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law, speak on clean Ganga, speak on clean India.
But this gave me an idea, what should I say on 15th August, can you send me suggestions
You can send to MyGov, write letters on Akashwani and write letters in the Prime Minister's Office.
I believe, perhaps it is a good idea that my speech on August 15 should be suggested by the public.
I am sure you will send good suggestions.
I want to express my concern towards one thing.
I do not want to give any preaching nor do I find a way to avoid the responsibilities of the units of the state government, central government or local Swaraj.
Just two days ago, I had a look at the scene of an accident in Delhi and after the accident, the scooter driver was suppressed for 10 minutes.
He did not get any help.
Anyway, I have seen that many people continue to write on the fact that you should talk about road safety.
Be aware of the people, Hoshakot Akshay of Bangalore, Amay Joshi of Pune, Prasanna Kakunje of Murbidri of Karnataka.
And when we look at the statistics, the heart shakes.
There is an accident every minute in our country.
Due to the accident, due to road accident, one death occurs every 4 minutes.
And the biggest concern is that about one-third of those who die about 15 to 25 years of age are young and one death shakes the entire family.
The work that the government should do should be done, but I ask parents, the environment of keeping an eye on our children, whether they run two-wheelers or our-wheelers.
There is another project for us, it is going to be expanded later, the Ashless Treatment, Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara. From there to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondia highways, we are giving priority to the first fifty hours - whether it is money or not, who will not give money or who will not give it all these concerns - how to get the best service to those injured in the Road Accident.
Tool-free 1033 numbers, lambulance arrangements to provide information about the accidents across the country, all these things have been done after accident.
We all really need to see that life is very lovely, life is very lovely and it needs to be seen in that way.
Sometimes I say, the employee becomes a workforce.
In the past, some incidents came to my mind, I liked that I should talk to you, sometimes the person who works, sometimes gets tired and sometimes he gets tired.
I liked to see this great example of how life can be brought to my work too.
Vijay Biswal has said how his interest, his art, his ability can be linked to his work.
Perhaps Vijay Biswal's painting will be discussed in the coming days.
And one thing came in my mind - the entire team of government officials from Harda district of Madhya Pradesh, the entire team started a work which touched my mind and I like it.
They started Operation War - Now someone, listening to it, it will seem something else.
See how the meaning of Rakshabandhan changed, I congratulate the entire team of government officials of Harda district.
Sometimes a news had come to my ears, sometimes these small things give me a lot of pleasure and so I am sharing with you.
There is a small village by Keshla in Rajnandgaon of Chhattisgarh.
The people of that village tried to make toilets for the last few months.
And now in that village no person has to go to the open.
He did this but when the entire work was completed, the entire village celebrated a very big festival like that.
These excellent examples of how the values are changing in social life, how the people are changing and how the citizens of the country are taking the country forward.
I am writing from Bhavesh Deka, Guwahati, regarding the questions of North-East.
The people of North-East are also very active.
They keep writing a lot, good thing.
But today I would like to tell them that there is a separate ministry for the North-East.
They will go to the districts, they will go to the villages, meet the local government officials, talk to the people and talk to the citizens.
They will hear the problems, they will also do what the Government of India has to do in the direction of solving problems.
These efforts will bring very good results in the coming days.
And those officers who come after visiting, they also feel that how beautiful the state, how good people have to live by developing this area and solving their problems.
If we return with this resolution, even after coming to Delhi, it has become very easy to understand the problems there.
So a good effort is an attempt to go from Delhi to the east, which I am saying Act East Policy. This is the fact.
My dear countrymen, we all are proud of the success of the Mars Mission.
However, sometimes it comes to the idea that if we talk to the younger generation and ask them what you want to be ahead then one or half of the 100 students will be found which will say that I have to become a scientist.
It is a matter of great concern to reduce the trend towards science.
It is a great need to take interest in innovation, encourage them and know their capabilities.
I also keep telling the IAS officers of the government that if you have gone ahead by writing so much, then you should also go to a school college near you for two-four hours a week and talk to the children.
The experience that you have, the power that you have, will definitely be used for this new generation.
Work is difficult, but to do.
We have launched it and in the coming years, we will get 24 hours of electricity to the villages.
The children of the village also have to read in the days of the examination and there is no problem of electricity.
If there are small industries in the village, then electricity is obtained.
Today even if you want to charge mobile then you have to go to another village.
The benefits that the cities get should be met by the villages.
And that is why we have started Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Programme.
I know that such a big country, millions of villages, to reach far and wide, to reach home.
But, it is only for the poor to run.
Today, in the matter of mind, it has decided to talk about the same.
In a way, our country has the opportunity of festivals in the month of August, September.
There are many festivals.
My best wishes to you all.
Send me suggestions for August 15.
Your ideas will be very useful to me.
In the last Mann Ki Baat, I had prayed to you people that if you go somewhere in the holidays, and if there is a memorable picture then incredible India.
When I said, I didn't think that such a strong result would be available.
Millions of people posted photos, in Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
I can say that India is full of diversity and diversity.
Be it architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas.
Perhaps the Government of India has never thought that people can do such a big job in terms of tourism which you people have done.
And some were so much liked to me that I also re-tweeted him.
The world will see it, our countrymen will see it and our new generation will see it.
My dear countrymen, you have made me the Prime Minister but sometimes the person within me loses himself from all the posts and prestiges.
21st June, International Day of Yoga, I can say that my mind was inspired in the same way as I had kept this topic in the NC.
We can say with the claim that the sun never moves in the world of yoga practicers.
The way the world has honoured Yoga by laying its eyelids, the way the world has raised it on its shoulders, which Indian will not be proud of it.
The mind became faded.
And when the people of France, for whom the Sean River and the Fiel Tower are a very proud symbol, they liked that place to do Yoga, they gave the place of equality.
People in New York performed Yoga on Times Suare.
If it is a matter of Australia, Sydney, then the picture of Pera House comes in front of us.
The citizens of Australia have done Yoga at the same time by keeping Yoga equal to the Para House.
Whether it is North America, Silicon Valley, Milan's umo Thethedral, it is a matter of pride in itself.
Similarly, the NPP-Keeeping Force also performed very well in Yoga.
Even in India, on Siachen, on white ice sheet, our soldiers were doing Yoga, Yoga programmes were organized by the navy in the sea, around the sea, wherever our navy ships were.
Delhi recorded its place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Rajpath became Yogapath.
I am grateful to the country and the world, and I can say that it was not a programme.
It seemed that from every corner of the world a new curiosity, a new joy, a new zeal, a new link.
A few days ago, when a family from Twitter, Vietnam, had tweeted photographs for the younger child, it was so lovely that photographs were so popular all over the world.
Everyone, women and men, elderly, villages and cities, developing countries or developing countries, everybody joined.
Yoga became one of the reasons for connecting the world in true sense.
But one thing I feel, and every Indian can feel proud that the world is very eager to know India.
A curiosity towards India has increased.
The values here, the traditions here, the heritage here, the world wants to know.
It is the responsibility of all of us to introduce the world to our heritage without lagging.
But we will be able to introduce this when we are proud of our heritage.
Sometimes we are so familiar that what is new in our things, it feels like our family values, we do not know that India's family values are very big for the world.
I'm sure I'll be surprised.
There are many things that our ancestors have given us and the best of them have the right to the world.
The success of International Day of Yoga has come to take a new responsibility with happiness and satisfaction.
It is our responsibility to give us the best yoga teacher to the world.
It is our responsibility to see all the traditions of yoga from a platform to the world.
Institutions related to yoga should be introduced, information about Yoga Gurus, information about Yoga.
If you want to learn yoga then you can learn where you want yoga teachers, you can get a database and I believe you can do it.
Let's start somebody from somewhere, it will also become a new power.
I see the events of the past few days and the working government, the running government, how can we bring results once the goal is fixed, we have seen it in the past.
And when there was disappointment all around, we should not forget that one year ago, the same voice was heard from all around, nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens.
You can imagine that AYUSH is a department in the government, nobody ever pays attention to it.
In 2-5 years, whenever you come to the news, you can come to the news so much. In one corner, a small department, but he led the Yoga Day.
And the small departments in the world have shown such a big task by organizing it.
If the goal is to be achieved then the small unit is also a sample of how good it works.
In the past, the world saw how our people saved the victims of Yemen.
Within hours, how did the people of India run to help Nepal, when the working government had to open the Jan Dhan Account in the bank, the people of all the banks came to the ground and in a short span of time millions of countrymen were linked to the bank.
On August 15, I had appealed to the Red Fort for toilets in schools and I had said that by August 15, we have to complete this work.
The work that was not done in 60 years was very courageous to call for a year, about four and a half lakh toilets were to be built, but today I can say with satisfaction that it is now a delay in coming to 15th August but it is not completed but people have completed the work of making toilets in almost schools.
It means that the government, the people, the government, the government, everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month, we had launched three public security schemes, I had done it from Calcutta.
In such a short time, there has been very positive results.
In India, a very little work has been done in terms of public security but due to these three schemes, we are putting a very big jump.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have joined somewhere in the schemes of these public security but we have to move forward.
Rakshabandhan festival comes in the month of August.
On behalf of Rakshabandhan's brother, sister can be a very big gift.
Let us all try to fulfill this resolution together with me.
When I talk about mind, many people also send suggestions to me.
This time I should say something for the monsoon, many people have sent such suggestions.
Yogesh Dandekar of Nagpur, Harshvardhan ji of Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni ji, Divyanshu Gupta ji, he said that for monsoon, you must tell something about Mann Ki Baat.
They have sent good suggestions.
You may also be able to enjoy hot pakoras, bhajaya, corn as well as tea in the rain.
But in the same way the sun rays give life, the rain gives strength to our lives.
The water of the village should be in the village, the water of the city should be in the city, it should be our resolve and efforts should be made to stop water.
And the rain water stops and if the land returns and the earth is recharged, then the problems of the year are solved.
I always tell people that if you go to Porbandar in Gujarat and if you go to visit Mahatma Gandhi's house then there is a tank in the underground of his two hundred years old house in which rain water was straight there.
Porbandar is on the banks of the sea, but sweet water was collected in the house by collecting rain water, at that time so much care was done.
We can also do it.
All of us should be in large quantities by social organizations and by the youth during the rainy season.
And I give a suggestion and I have a direct experience, a very successful experience.
This is my entire rural technology.
When you plant the plant, put an old soil clock in the plant garden and fill it with water.
If you fill water twice a month, it will also run.
I also keep telling the farmers that you plant trees instead of fenced on the edge of your farm.
They will become your property.
And we know that water diseases spread very much during rainy days.
Due to the increase in moisture in the environment, bacteria begin to grow and cleanliness becomes very important for this, cleanliness becomes very important.
The request to drink pure water is necessary.
It is true that as much as we care, the disease will be away from us.
Water should be required, rain should also be done but disease should also be avoided.
Friends, Nowadays, we have launched three new schemes, especially for the urban people.
There are about 500 small towns in our country.
Under the AMRUT scheme, we have taken a big campaign to make our cities alive.
In the same way, such a country should also be equal to the world.
In the country, there should be a smart city that can be equal to the world and on the other hand the poorest of the poor people of the country should have their homes to live and the houses that have electricity, water, toilets and schools to read nearby.
In 2022, when India will celebrate 75 years of independence, we want to give home to the countrymen.
With these three things, a big scheme has been started.
I am confident that all these schemes will be used to bring about a change in urban life.
I myself have been associated with you all through social media, many new ideas keep meeting me with you people and I keep getting good information about the government.
But sometimes a person sitting in a far-flung village also touches our heart.
You know that a daughter-in-law-daughter-in-law program is underway from the government.
But when the government's programme makes a person, society, village, how much it increases.
In the past, a Sarpanch from Bibipur village in Haryana, Sunil Jaglan ji took him a very funny initiative.
In Haryana, the number of girls is very low as compared to children.
There are about 100 districts in the country in which this condition is worrisome.
The highest in Haryana.
But the Sarpanch Beti Bachao Abhiyan of a small village in the same Haryana gives such a turn, then the mind is very happy and a new hope is awakened.
That's why I express my happiness.
But this incident has inspired me and therefore I also urge you to post your daughter with your daughter, with your daughter, with your daughter and with your daughter.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, who gives strength to this idea will write a tagline, write a fine line, it can be in any language, whether it is English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any language.
The very inspirational tagline that I will be from it will be selfie of your daughter and I will retweet you.
We all can transform this thing into a mass movement in a way to save daughter-daughter.
The work started by brother Sunil from Bibipur village in Haryana and we all move forward together and I urge you to do your selfiewithdaughter.
So my best wishes to all of you in this rain, enjoy rain.
Make our country green.
International Day of Yoga is not for one day but you continue the practice of Yoga.
You see, you'll see the benefits.
Make it a part of your life, it must be done.
Incredible India, you must travel somewhere, keep sending photographs.
The country and the world will know how diversity our country has.
One thought that there was very little in terms of handicraft.
We have to reach the world, we have to reach the features of India all around.
And we have a simple medium, we must reach.
My dear countrymen, today I will meet for the next time for the next thing.
He used to listen, repeat and sometimes inspire his own words and inspire the families of 130 crore people in a light environment.
You can imagine that it might have gone to the midst of the Kalkhand, how will it be
Perhaps it wasn't an immortal program
This programme had livelihood, its its its own, it was the attachment of the mind, the hearts were attached. And because of this, the time in between was very difficult for me.
I was missing something every moment and when I talk about my mind, even if I am, the words are mine, the voice is mine, but, the story is yours, the Purushartha is yours, the valour is yours.
was feeling an emptyness
But this Sunday waited a lot
Well, I've got the chance.
Many messages have come in the last few months in which people said that they are missing the matter of mind
Sometimes I feel that this is my own journey to Samshti .
This is my most important journey of age
My silence dialogue with you for me was a part of my special visit in a way.
Many people have asked me a lot of questions, why did I go to Kedarnath in the turmoil of elections
Most people have drawn political meaning from it .
For me, that was the opportunity to meet me.
In a way I went to meet me,
I will not tell other things today, but I will need to do so that the vacancies that was due to this short-term of mind, in the valley of Kedar, in that solitary cave, perhaps he had given an opportunity to fill something.
The rest is your curiosity - I think I ' m going to discuss it anytime .
As people have expressed their desire to know about Kedar, your efforts to emphasize a positive thing, I am constantly feeling in your words.
The letters that come for Mann Ki Baat, the inputs that are received are completely different from the routine government functioning.
In a way your letter also becomes the cause of inspiration for me and sometimes becomes the cause of energy .
Sometimes sometimes my ideas do some of your words to edge the process .
If people put the challenges in front of the country and society, then they also explain solutions along with it.
If someone writes for cleanliness then he is expressing his resentment towards dirt but also appreciates the efforts of cleanliness .
If someone discusses the environment then he feels painful, but at the same time he also tells the experiments he has seen - he also tells the experiments he has seen and the imaginations he has in his mind also depicts.
It tells us that there is no shortage of internal strength, strength and talent within the countrymen.
It is necessary to incorporate those strengths and talents, provide opportunities, implement them.
Mann Ki Baat also tells that in the progress of the country, all 130 crore countrymen want to join with strength and activism and I must say one thing that I have so many letters in Mann Ki Baat, so many telephone calls come, so many messages are received, but the element of the complaint is very low and someone asks for something, asks for himself, so one thing has not come in my mind in the last five years.
When I analysis these things, you can imagine how much joy will my heart get, how much energy will I get
Actually I have not come - you have brought me, you have made me sit and you have given me the opportunity to speak once again.
With this feeling, let's move forward the process of mind
When the Emergency was imposed in the country, its opposition was not limited to the political realm, it was not limited to politicians, till the bars of the jail, the movement was not limited.
In the Emergency, every citizen of the country started feeling that something has been taken away from it.
Recently, the great festival of democracy, the great election campaign of our country, the rich to the poor, all were happy to decide the future of our country in this festival.
When something is very close to us, we neglect the importance of it.
In India, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, more than 61 crore people voted, City One Crore
This number can seem very common to us but if I say according to the world, if we leave China then more than any country in the world had voted in India.
The number of voters who voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of the US, is almost double
The number of total voters in India is more than the population of the whole Europe .
It introduces the vastness and extension of our democracy .
The Lok Sabha election of 2019 was the world's largest democratic election in history so far.
You can imagine how much resources and human power have been needed to complete such elections.
Elections of millions of teachers, officers and employees were possible with hard work day and night.
In order to successfully fulfil this great man of democracy, about 3 lakh security personnel of the paramilitary forces performed their obligations, 20 lakh policemen from different states also served their hard work.
As a result of the hard work of these people, this time more than the last time polling took place
About 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines across the country for voting, you can imagine how big you can imagine
All this was done so that it can be ensured that no voter is deprived of his franchise.
In a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh, a polling station was created for just one female voter.
Polling stations located at the highest in the world are also in India
This polling station is located at an altitude of 15,000 feet in Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Apart from this, there is also another fact that is proud in this election.
Perhaps, this is the first time in history that women have voted with enthusiasm like men.
Polling percentage of women and men in this election was almost equal
Another encouraging fact related to this is that today there are record 78 women MPs in Parliament.
I congratulate the Election Commission and every person associated with the election process and salute the aware voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard from my mouth many times, books are not booked, I was urging that we can give books instead of flowers in the welcome.
Since then , people have been giving books in sufficient place .
However, I could not get a lot of time, but during my stay I got the opportunity to read some of his stories again.
His stories contain the mindset of the whole of India .
When I was reading the story of his name of intoxication, my mind himself went on the economic inequalities prevailing in society.
This story of zamindar's son God and the poor family's Bir learns from the story that if you are not careful then when the effect of bad compassion goes up, it does not seem to be known.
The second story, which touched my heart inside, was Idgah, the sensitivity of a child, his pure love for his grandmother, so mature in such a young age
When Hamid of 4-5 years of age reaches his grandmother with a stick from the fair, then in fact, human sentiment reaches his peak.
The last line of this story is very emotional because it has a great truth of life, the child Hamid played the part of old Hamid, old Amina, girl Amina.
Such a big poem is the night of Pus
In this story a live depiction of the irony of a poor farmer life was found .
Turmeric farmer is happy even after his crop is destroyed because now he will not have to sleep in the farm in the cold cold.
Although these stories have been almost a century ago, their relevance still feels the same.
After reading them, I felt a different kind of experience.
When there is talk of reading, in some media, I was reading about the letter library of Kerala.
You will be surprised to know that this library is in a village settled between the dense forests of Idukki
P.K. Murlidharan, teacher of the primary school here and P.V. Chinnathampi, who runs a small tea shop, both of them have worked tirelessly for this library.
There was a time when books were brought here by filling them in the clutches and putting them on the back.
Today this library is showing a new path to everyone with tribal children.
Wanche Gujarat campaign was a successful experiment in Gujarat
Millions of people from every age group participated in this campaign to read books .
In today's digital world, at the time of Google Guru, I would also urge you to take some time out and place the book in your daily routine.
You will really enjoy and write on the Narendra Modi App about what you read so that all the audience of mind will also be able to know about it .
My dear countrymen, I am happy to note that the people of our country are thinking about issues that are not only a challenge for the present but also for the future.
I was reading your comments on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I saw that many people have written a lot about the problem of water.
Belagavi's Pawan Gaurai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, besides Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written to me about water related challenges.
Water has great importance in our culture
You give your blessings like your mother , and your blessings continue to rain on us .
Due to lack of water many parts of the country are affected every year .
You will be surprised that only 8 of the water received from the rains in our country is saved .
I am confident that like other problems, we will also solve this crisis with the strength, cooperation and determination of one hundred and thirty crore countrymen with public participation and manpower.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been formed in the country keeping the importance of water paramount.
This will facilitate quick decisions on all matters related to water
A few days ago I tried to separate something .
I wrote a letter to the Sarpanches across the country to the Gram Pradhan
I wrote to the village heads that to save water, to save water, to save the drops of rain water, to convene a meeting of the Gram Sabha and discuss with the villagers.
I am happy that he has shown full enthusiasm in this work and on the 22nd of this month, millions of people have donated slaves in thousands of panchayats.
In the villages, people resolved to collect one drop of water
Today, in the Mann Ki Baat programme, I want to tell you about a Sarpanch.
Listen, the Sarpanch of the Lupung Panchayat of Cuttackamsandi Block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given us all the message. My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas
People there, once again are ready to play their active role for water conservation
My best wishes to all the village heads, to all Sarpanches and to them for this activation.
There are many Sarpanches across the country who have taken the lead of water conservation.
In a way the entire village has become an opportunity.
It seems that the people of the village have now gathered in the competition to build water temples like in their villages.
As I said, collective efforts can lead to big positive results
There can be no formula to deal with water crisis all over the country .
For this, efforts are being made in different parts of the country in different ways.
But everyone's goal is the same, and that's to save water, water conservation
Drainage lines are being corrected in Punjab
This effort is getting rid of the problem of waterlogging.
The construction of a tank in Thimaipalli (Thimaipalli) in Telangana is changing the lives of the people of the villages.
In the Kabirdham of Rajasthan, small ponds built in the fields have made a big change.
I was reading about a collective effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu where 20 thousand women came together to revive the Nag river.
I have also read about the women of Garhwal who are doing very good work on rainwater harvesting together.
I am confident that many such efforts are being made and when we are united and striving firmly, we can also make impossible possible.
When people connect, water will be saved
Today I am making 3 requests from the countrymen through Mann Ki Baat.
My first request is like the people of the country gave cleanliness the form of a mass movement, just like we start a mass movement for water conservation.
Together, let us resolve to save every drop of water and I believe that water is the prasad of God, water is the form of Paras.
Earlier they used to say that iron becomes gold from the touch of Paras .
I say, the water is Paras and the Paras, the touch of water, the new life is created.
Initiate an awareness campaign to save one drop of water
Tell about water related problems, as well as propagate ways to save water.
I particularly urge celebrities from different regions to lead innovative camps for water conservation.
Whether it is a film world or a sports world or our companions of the media or people associated with social organizations or people associated with cultural organisations or people associated with narratives, everyone should lead this movement in their own way.
Awake society, add society, join society with society
You see, we can see changes in front of our eyes.
My second request to the countrymen is that many traditional methods are being used for the conservation of water in our country for centuries.
I urge all of you to share those traditional methods of water conservation.
If one of you had got the opportunity to visit Porbandar, Poojya Bapu's birthplace, then there is another house behind the house of revered Bapu, there is a 200-year-old water tank and even today there is a water storage tank and there is a arrangement to stop rain water, then I always used to say that whatever Kirti temple goes, see that water tank.
Let us motivate people to conserve water by making a list of more and more methods related to water conservation.

My dear countrymen, I have to express my gratitude for another thing and express my gratitude to the people of the world.
On 21st June, once again in Yoga Day, with the activism and enthusiasm, three-three-four generations of each family came together and celebrated Yoga Day
The importance of Yoga Day is increasing in the awareness that has come up for the Colistic Health Care.
Everyone, in every corner of the world, as soon as the sun comes out, if a Yoga lover welcomes it, then it is a complete journey to sunlight.
In India, from the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, from Siachen to Submarine, from Air Force to Aircraft Carriers, from a gyms to the hot desert, from villages to cities wherever possible, Yoga was not only done at every place but it was also collectively celebrated.
Presidents, Prime Ministers, well-known celebrities, ordinary citizens from many countries of the world showed me on Twitter how they celebrate Yoga in their respective countries.
On that day, the world looked like a very happy family
We all know that healthy and sensitive persons are needed to build a healthy society and Yoga ensures it .
Therefore, the propagation of yoga is a great task of social service .
Should not such a service be recognized and honored
In the year 2019, the announcement of Prime Ministers Awards to contribute to the promotion and development of Yoga was a matter of great satisfaction for me.
This award has been given to organisations around the world which you have not even imagined how they have contributed significantly to the spread of Yoga.
For example, take Japan Yoga Niketan, who has made Yoga popular throughout Japan
Japan Yoga Niketan runs several institutions and training courses there or take the name of Ms. Antonietta Roy of Italy who started the Sarva Yoga International and spread Yoga throughout Europe.
These are inspiring examples in themselves .
If this is a matter related to yoga, can Indians stay behind it
Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya, Munger was also honoured, Yoga has been dedicated to the last several decades.
It is a very important journey for me to join your thoughts .
Let's keep meeting, keep talking
Keep listening to your emotions, keep conserving, understanding
Sometimes I try to live those emotions
Stay your blessings
You are my inspiration, you are my energy
Let's sit together and enjoy the matter of mind and play the responsibilities of life.
Then I will meet again the next month for the matter of mind .
Thank you very much to me
This weather is also of heat on one side, and somewhere it is also of grief.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2015
Mann Ki Baat, December 2014
I have seen that there was no programme of evils of the government and I believe that in a way there was a struggle to get out of the problem and because of this the atmosphere of good discussions has started. The government's responsibilities have also been sensitive. They feel that they cannot be indifferent now. I want to ask those youngsters who are drunk.
Have you ever thought
Imagine
If the money of these drugs goes to the terrorists
If the terrorists buy arms from these money
And from those arms a terrorist will shoot in the breasts of my countrymen .
My country's young man will be martyred
Have you ever thought that a mother who kills the red of a mother, the mother of India's favourite, who lives and dies for the country, has been shot in the chest of a soldier, isn't it
Have we ever seen that we mostly discuss their physical progress with our children
Modi ji do not you tired
One month is very long .
There are many incidents in the country and the world .
All of you celebrated Diwali with zeal and enthusiasm .
Festivals are the festivals that keep enthusiastic in life from time to time, be it the poor, the rich, the village, the city, the festival has its own greatness in everybody's life.
Sometimes they think that leave man or people are useless, people have nothing to do. Our country is so.
I am talking about my last mind and today I say that it is very important to change this thinking. Our country is not like this, people of our country are not like this.
Sometimes I feel that the country is far ahead and the governments are far behind.
And when I say with experience that perhaps it is very important for the governments to change their thinking .
And I am saying that I see that these young people are committed to do something or the other by doing something or the other.
and doing it in its own way .
I had said last time, buy at least one khadi garment.
I didn ' t ask anyone to become a khadi - holder . But I got information from the Khadi - holders that in a week , about 125 percent handread and twenty five percent sales increased .
In a way , more than double khadi was sold in a week from 2nd October to 1st October as compared to last year .
This means that the people of the country are many times ahead of what we think.
I salute the Indians .
Cleanliness. Someone can imagine that cleanliness will take the form of such a mass movement.
Expectations are very much, and should also be.
And I see a good result, cleaning is now being seen in two parts.
One who is an old filth, who is a filthy filth, what will the people sitting in the government system do for it.
There is a big challenge , but you cannot run away from responsibility .
All the governments have to take steps for the responsibility of all the municipalities as the pressure of the people is going to increase.
And the media is also playing a very good role in it .
But the other aspect which is very eager, joyful and satisfactory to the mind. The common man has started feeling that let's leave the first thing, we will not do dirt now.
We ' ll not justify new filth .
Some of Satna, Madhya Pradesh and some of them have made Bharat Gupta, they have sent a mail to my mygov.
He said his experience of visiting the railway. He said that Saheb used to go to the railway earlier, this time too he went to the railway but I see that every passenger in the railway keeps on eating and drinking, throwing papers and throwing papers. But nobody was throwing it, not only this, he used to find that there is a dustbin in the box, put garbage in it.
And when he saw that there was no arrangement in the railways , he himself collected his waste in the corner .
He said this was a very pleasant experience for me .
I am grateful to Bharat ji for delivering this information to me .
But I am seeing this that the most impact has happened in small children .
Hundreds of families talk about the fact that if our child eats chocolate somewhere , then the paper takes up immediately .
I had just seen one in the social media that someone had written. Today's hero.. and today in my hero, he gave a picture of a child.
You see. Everyone has started feeling that our country, we will not be dirty.
We ' ll not justify the dirt .
And whatever they do, they feel embarrassed, somebody gets to beat them immediately.
I consider it auspicious sign .
One good thing is also happening that those who come to meet me these days, people from all walks of life meet me.
Someone talks about cleanliness, somebody talks about education, somebody discusses social reforms.
Someone is discussing the loss of our family life .
I think , otherwise , if such a businessman comes first , he will talk to the government about his own interests .
But I see a big change .
They talk less about their selfishness, they talk more about taking some responsibility related to society.
Whenever I see these things by adding, I remember that one is moving forward towards a very good change.
If my poor family is not sick , there will never be any economic crisis in his life .
If he remains healthy then he will work hard, earn and run the family.
And therefore my cleanliness is directly related to the health of my poor brothers and sisters.
Whether we are able to serve the poor or not , we do not filth , it is better for the poor .
I have also seen that those who work in this field are sending me the stories of their success .
But I came to know about two things from my government .
After my saying the officers of our H . . . ministry they felt that we should also do something .
And the officers together made a plan .
See , the example of how changes begin in the government .
One he decided that if he wants to go to technical education then he has planned to give him special scholarship by favouring one thousand good specialty-abled children .
I congratulate all the officials of the department for their ideas .
I got the opportunity to go to Siachen in the past .
I spent in the middle of the dead soldiers for the country of Diwali .
When the country was celebrating Diwali, I went to Siachen.
Because we are celebrating Diwali because of them, then I went among them.
I have experienced how many difficulties they live in.
I salute the soldiers who protect the country .
But today I have to say another pride .
The soldiers of our country work in the field of security .
At the time of natural calamity , anybody is ready to dare to defend us by putting a beating of life .
I specially congratulate these soldiers .
I had just got an opportunity to have a tea and drink programme with the winners of our country, young students, young girls and sportspersons.
I got a new energy .
Their enthusiasm and zeal I was seeing that our arrangements and facilities are very low compared to other countries, but instead of complaints, they were talking about doing something more with zeal and enthusiasm.
The programme for tea and drink was very inspiring for me in myself.
On one side, I want to tell the countrymen, and I really want to say with my heart and my mind's point.
And I believe that the countrymen have faith in my words and my intentions.
But once again I want to repeat it on my behalf .
As far as black money is concerned, Black Money is concerned, my countrymen, trust your principal servant, this is the Artificial of Feth for me.
The money that has gone out of the poor of India should come back to Pi-Pi, this is my commitment.
There can be a difference of opinion about what is the way, what is the method, what is the way.
And democracy is natural , but my countrymen , I assure you that we are on the right path , on the basis of the knowledge I have .
Today no one knows, I don't know, nor do the government know, nor did the previous government know how much money is outside.
Everyone keeps telling their own ways, different figures.
I do not want to complicate in those figures, my commitment is this, two rupees, five rupees, millions, billions, billions and billions. This is the money of the poor of the country and should come back.
And I assure you , there will be no shortage of my efforts .
There will be no use .
I'm just blessing you.
I will definitely do whatever I have to do for you, whenever I have to do.
I assure you of this .
I have received a letter .
Shriman Abhishek has come from Parikh .
However, even when I was not the Prime Minister, many mothers and sisters had expressed this feeling.
He has told me that you must discuss this matter with your mind .
I agree with his pain .
When I talk about the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely discuss this drug addiction, these drugs, the mafia and the huge crisis of India's youth wealth the next time.
If you have some experiences in this regard, you have some information, if you have saved children of this addiction, if you have some ways to save them, if you have played a good role in saving them, if you give me some such information then I will talk to the countrymen about these good efforts and we will create an atmosphere in every family that no child should go on this path due to frustration, we will definitely discuss it in detail.
I know that I am handling the topics in which the government first comes to the dock .
But how long will we keep things hidden
I ' m also daring . Because of your love .
Because of your blessings and I will continue to do it .
Some people have also told me that Modi ji, you were saying that you should suggest us, give us on the face book, give me on the tweeter, send e-mail.
But there is a large section of the country, who do not have this or what they do.
Your point is right .
This facility is not with everyone .
So I tell you that if you want to say anything about my mind, you listen to me on the village-village radio then you will also send a letter to me, you will definitely reach me.
And I will definitely take it seriously because the active citizen is the largest capital of development.
You write a letter, that means you're very active.
To talk about my mind, your mind should also be connected.
Maybe you must write a letter .
I'll try, then talk to you next month.
My effort will be, whenever I talk, I will do it on Sunday, I will do it at 11 o'clock in the day.
So I ' m facilitating access to you .
Slowly the beginning of cold is happening .
There is a very good weather for health .
But along with this there is also a very good weather for health .
Don ' t let it go .
Use it a lot .
My dear countrymen, today is the holy festival of Vijayadashmi.
My best wishes to you all on the occasion of Vijayadashmi.
I will try, if possible, talk to you twice a month or once a month.
Further, I have also thought in my mind that whenever I talk, I will be on Sunday and the time will be at 11 o'clock in the morning, you will also be convenient and I will also be satisfied that I have succeeded in bringing my mind to your mind.
Today, the festival of Vijayadashmi is a festival of victory of good on evils.
But the gentlemen of Ganesh Venkatadari Mumbai, they sent me a mail, he said that in Vijayadashmi, we will resolve to eliminate ten evils within us.
I express my gratitude to them for this suggestion.
Everyone must have thought of defeating the more evils within himself, but as a nation, I feel that let us all resolve to liberate from dirt on the holy festival of Vijayadashmi and achieve victory by eliminating dirt, we can do this pledge on the festival of Vijayadashmi.
I had said one thing yesterday in the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that I will invite nine people and they will upload their video in social media while cleaning themselves and invite nine more people.
When we talk about Mahatma Gandhi, the matter of Khadi comes in very natural meditation.
You know that our scientists have successfully used to reach Mars at the least cost, successfully.
There is no shortage of strength, just we have forgotten our power.
Have forgotten yourself.
I remember what Swami Vivekanand Ji used to say. Swami Vivekananda often used to say one thing.
Once, the child who had gone with the lioness had grown up.
He started saying what you're doing.
You're a lion.
They have made me bigger.
Look at my voice, see my way of conversation.
So the lion said that let's show me who you are.
He took him to a well and showed his face inside the water in the well and told him with his own face- Look, we both have one face.
I am also a lion, you are also a lion and as soon as the self-esteem awakened from within it, he also started crushing the lions in the midst of the sheep like that lion.
The existence within him was awake.
Swami Vivekananda ji used to say this.
My countrymen, there is immense power and immense potential within 1. 25 billion countrymen.
We need to recognize ourselves.
We need to recognise the strength in ourselves and then we will be victorious and our nation will be victorious and successful by taking that self-respect and recognition that Swami Vivekananda had said.
I spent two hours with them, perhaps it was a very emotional and very inspiring event of my life.
God may have liked that family, but that child is the responsibility of the entire nation.
Later, I had so much emotional touch that I used to do different Olympics for Special Abeld children in Gujarat.
Thousands of children used to come and their parents used to come and I used to go to myself.
And that is why I liked Gautam Pal's suggestions which he had given and I thought that I should share with you the suggestions I had received.
One story comes to me even more attention.
If you knew why did not you tell.
My countrymen, unless we resolve to walk, we do not stand ourselves, then those who show the way will not be found.
We will not get the finger holders.
We will have to start walking and I am confident that 125 crore will be capable of walking.
People send big interesting suggestions to me for a few days.
Some people have said that when they start small industries then the process of registration should be easy.
I will definitely inform the government for it.
Some people have written to me and sent children to teach skill development from fifth grade.
Someone has written to me that every hundred meters should have a dust bean, if you have to arrange cleanliness.
Some people have written to me that polythene pack should be banned.
A lot of suggestions are sending me.
I would like to tell you from now on if you will send me any truth incident anywhere, which is positive, which inspires me, inspires the countrymen, if such truth happens to me with evidence then I will definitely talk to the people of the country when I will talk about what has touched my mind.
All this is my intention to talk to me, come together and serve our mother India.
We should take the country to new heights.
As it comes to mind, I will definitely keep talking to you in the future.
I have told you the things that came in my mind today.
When I meet you, I will meet on Sunday, I will meet at 11 in the morning but I am confident that our journey will continue, your love will continue.
After listening to me, if you want to tell me something, definitely bring me, I will like it.
I was very happy to talk to you all today and radio. It is such a simple medium that I will be able to reach far and wide.
I will reach the poorest of the poor household because my country's strength is in the hut of the poor, the strength of my country is in the village, the strength of my country is in the mothers and sisters and young people, the strength of my country is in the farmers.
With your trust, the country will move forward.
I express confidence.
You have faith in your power so I believe in the future of India.
The mind is filled today while starting the matter of mind
10 days ago, Mother India lost her brave sons
These brave heroes, we consumed ourselves in the defense of 1. 25 billion Indians.
The countrymen could sleep peacefully, so these brave sons had kept them together day and night.
In the Pulwama terror attack, after the martyrdom of brave soldiers, people across the country, and in the minds of the people, there is trauma and resentment.
Condolences to the martyrs and their families have grown all around
I bow down to all the brave sons of the country who have laid down their lives in the defense of Mother India.
This challenge faced by the country, we all have to forget racism, communalism, regionalism and all other differences so that our steps against terror are stronger, stronger and decisive.
Our armed forces have always been introducing unique courage and valour.
In order to establish peace where they have shown wonderful potential , the attackers have also worked to respond to their language .
You must have seen how steps have been taken within 100 hours of the attack.
Army has taken a pledge to destroy terrorists and their helpers .
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the inspirational things of their families through the media have further emphasized the courage of the whole country.
Ramniranjan ji, father of Shaheed Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar, inspires us all in this hour of grief.
He said , They will send their other sons to fight against enemies , and if needed , they will go to fight .
The whole country is saluting the indomitable courage of Meena ji , wife of Shaheed Prasanna Sahu of Jagat Singhpur of Odisha .
He has also taken a pledge to join his only son .
When the body of martyr Vijay Shoren wrapped in the tricolor reached Gumla of Jharkhand , the innocent son said that I will also go to the army .
The oppression of this innocent today expresses the spirit of children and children of India
Such feelings are being seen in the house of our brave and brave martyrs.
No one of our brave martyrs is exception in it, their family is not exception
Whether it is the family of the martyr Vijay Maurya of Deoria, the parents of the martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six-year-old son of Shaheed Hemraj of Kota, the story of every family of the martyrs is full of inspiration.
I would urge the younger generation to know and try to understand the responsibilities and feelings that these families have shown.
What is patriotism, what is sacrifice and penance, we will not need to go towards the old incidents of history.
In front of our eyes, these are living examples and this is the reason for inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, the war memorial that was waiting for all of us for such a long time of independence is going to end now.
The curiosity of the countrymen about this, curiosity is very natural
Udupi on the Narendra ModiApp, Shri Omkar Shetty of Karnataka has expressed his happiness at the preparation of the National War Memorial.
I was also surprised and painful that there was no national war memorial in India.
A memorial where the brave stories of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives to protect the nation can be preserved.
I decided that there should be a memorial in the country.
We decided to build the National War Memorial and I am happy that this memorial has been built in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on February 25, we will hand over this National Military Memorial to our Army.
The country will make a small effort to repay its debt
The heart of Delhi i.e. the place where India Gate and Amar Jawan Jyoti are present, just near it, a new memorial has been built.
I am confident that going to the National Military Memorial for the countrymen will be like going to a pilgrimage place.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the nation to the soldiers who sacrificed the highest since independence.
The design of the memorial shows the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The concept of the National Military Memorial is focused on our concentrate circles, where there is a depiction of the journey from the birth of a soldier to martyrdom.
Amar Chakra's flame is a symbol of the immortality of the martyr soldier
The second circle is the bravery cycle that shows the courage and bravery of the soldiers.
This is a gallery where the exploits of the bravery of the soldiers on the walls are engraved.
Subsequently, this Cyrcle reflects the sacrifices of the soldiers.
In this the names of the soldiers who sacrificed the highest sacrifice for the country are written in gold letters .
After this the protector cycle displays security
This circle has a line of dense trees
These trees are symbols of soldiers and conveying the message to the citizens of the country that every time the soldiers are deployed on the border and the countrymen are safe.
Overall, the National Military Memorial will be identified as a place where people will come to know about the great martyrs of the country, to express their gratitude and research them.
Here is the story of those sacrifices who have laid down their lives for the country so that we can live so that the country can be safe and developed
It is not possible to express the great contribution of our armed forces, police and paramilitary forces in the development of the country.
In October last year, I was fortunate to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of our idea under which we believe that the country should be grateful to the men and women policemen who are constantly engaged in our security .
I hope you will visit the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you go there, share your pictures on social media so that others also get inspiration from it and they too are eager to see this holy place, this memorial.
My dear countrymen, thousands of letters and statements for Mann Ki Baat, I get to read through different mediums.
This time when I was reading your conference, I came to my notice a very interesting comment by Atish Mukhopadhyay ji .
He has written that on March 3, 1900, the British had arrested Birsa Munda, then his age was only 25 years old, it is a coincidence that on March 3, Jamshedji Tata's birth anniversary is also there.
And they write further , these two personalities are completely from two different family backgrounds that enriched the heritage and history of Jharkhand .
In a way of paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata in Mann Ki Baat, it is like saluting the glorious history and heritage of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have raised the name of Jharkhand not the whole country
The whole country is grateful for their contribution .
Today, if our youth need an inspirational personality for guidance, then it is Lord Birsa Munda
The British concealed and caught them with a great trick when they were asleep .
Do you know why they resorted to such cowardly action
Because the British , who created such a great empire , were afraid of them .
Lord Birsa Munda had shaken the English rule equipped with guns and guns only with his traditional arrows .
Actually, when people get an inspirational leadership, then the collective will of the people is huge on the power of arms.
Lord Birsa Munda fought not only with the British for political freedom but also for the social and economic rights of the tribals .
In his little life he did all this .
In the dark life of the deprived and the deprived, the sun scattered like the sun
Lord Birsa Munda sacrificed himself at the age of 25
The son of Bharat Maa like Birsa Munda has been in every part of the country
Perhaps any corner of India would be such that no one has contributed to this war of independence for centuries.
But unfortunately, the stories of their sacrifice, valour and sacrifice have not reached the new generation.
If, a personality like Lord Birsa Munda made us realize our existence, then a person like Jamshedji Tata gave the country a big institution
Jamshedji Tata was truly a vision, who not only saw the future of India but also laid its strong foundation.
They knew well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry is essential for the future.
Not only that, he also established many world class institutions like Tata Steel and industries.
My dear countrymen, former Prime Minister of our country Morarji Bhai Desai was born on 29th February.
As you all know this day comes only once in 4 years .
The wealthy, peaceful personality, Morarji Bhai was one of the most disciplined leaders of the country.
The record of presenting the highest budget in Parliament in independent India is the name of Morarji Bhai Desai.
Morarji Desai led India in that difficult time when the country's democratic fabric was at risk.
Morarji Bhai Desai cast himself in the movement against the Emergency to protect democracy
For this, he had to pay a huge price in old age too
The government of that time arrested him and put him in jail
But when the Janata Party won the election in 1977, he became the Prime Minister of the country
During his tenure only 44th Constitution Amendment was brought
This is important because the 42nd Amendment brought about during Emergency, in which the powers of the Supreme Court were reduced and other provisions that violated our democratic values were returned.
As the 44th Amendment provides for publication of proceedings of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies in newspapers
Under this, some powers of the Supreme Court were restored in this amendment also provided that the fundamental officers found under Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be violated even during the Emergency .
For the first time it was arranged that on the written recommendation of the Cabinet the President will announce the Emergency and it was also decided that the period of Emergency can not be extended more than six months at once .
In this way, Morarji Bhai ensured that the way democracy was killed in the Emergency Implementation, 1975, it could not be repeated in the future.
His invaluable contribution to the greatness of Indian democracy will always be remembered by the future generations.
Once again I pay my homage to such a great leader
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of curiosity among the people about the Padma Awards.
Today, we are moving towards a New India, we want to respect those people who are doing their work at the grass-root level in a brutal manner.
On the strength of their hard work they are bringing about positive changes in the lives of others in different ways .
Indeed, they are true Karmayogis, who are selflessly involved in public service, social service and above all in national service.
You must have seen when the Padma Award is announced , people ask who it is .
In a way, I believe it as a great success because these are those people who are not on the front page of T.
These are away from the world of shining, but these are people who do not care about their name just believe in working at the grassroots level.
Yoga : He wins the message of Karmasu Kaushalam Gita in a way
I want to tell you about some such people
You must have heard about the Daitari Nayak of Odisha. He is not called the Janal Man of the Disha. Daitari Nayak cut the mountains in his village and made a canal for three kilometers. With his hard work, Irrigation and water problem ended forever
Take Abdul Gafur Khatri ji of Gujarat, he did a wonderful job to revive the traditional rogan paintings of Kutch.
They are doing a big job to bring this rare painting to a new generation .
I had given the gift to former US President Barack Obama to the tree of art made by Abdul Gafur .
Among the awardees, Shabbir Said Gau-Mata of Marathwada is known as the servant of the Padma Awards.
The way he spent his entire life in the service of God is unique in itself .
Madurai Chinna Pillai is the same person who first tried to empower the victims and the exploited through the Colongium Movement in Tamil Nadu and started a community-based small financial system
Even at the age of 100, he is training people from all over the world and has so far made one and a half thousand people Yoga teachers.
Jamuna Tudu, famously known as Lady Taran in Jharkhand, did the courage to take iron from Timber Mafia and Naxalites. He not only saved 50 hectares of forests but also united ten thousand women and motivated them to protect trees and wildlife
It is the glory of Jamuna ji's hard work that today the villagers plant 18 trees on the birth of every child and 10 trees on the marriage of the girl.
The story of Muktaben Pankajkumar Dagli of Gujarat will fill you with inspiration, despite being disabled himself, it is difficult to find an example of the work done for the upliftment of Divyang women. By establishing an institution named Chakshu Mahila Sevakunj, they are engaged in the work of making blind children self-reliant.
The story of Rajkumari Devi, a farmer of Muzaffarpur in Bihar, is very inspiring.
He has presented an example in the direction of women empowerment and making agriculture profitable .
Kisan Aunt linked 300 women from their area to Self Help Group and motivated them to become financially self-reliant
He trained the women of the village as well as other means of employment. The special thing is that they worked to connect technology with agriculture and my countrymen, perhaps for the first time this year, 12 farmers have got Padma Awards in the Padma Awards given this year.
Normally , very few people associated with agriculture and very few people who do direct farming have come to the list of Padmashrees .
This is a living picture of changing India in itself.
My dear countrymen, today I want to talk to you all about a heart touching experience that I have been feeling for the past few days.
Nowadays, wherever I am going to the country, I am trying to meet some beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat scheme PM-JAY i. e.
He was treated by this scheme and he became healthy and the head of the household was a victim of hard work and was unable to work for his family. This scheme benefited him and he became healthy and started living a new life.
Brothers and sisters, About twelve lakh poor families have taken advantage of this scheme in the last five months.
I found how big a change is coming in the life of the poor .
If you all know any poor person who is unable to treat him in the absence of money , tell him about this scheme .
Different Education Boards across the country will initiate procedures for testing the tenth and twelfth grade board in the next few weeks.
My best wishes to all the students, their parents and all the teachers on my behalf.
A few days ago, a very big event of exam-pay discussion in Delhi was held at the Format of Town All
One of the characteristics of the discussion on the examination was that there were open discussions on various subjects related to the examination .
There are many aspects that are certainly beneficial for the students .
All the students, their teachers, their parents can see the recording of this entire programme on YouTube. Greetings to all my team workers for the upcoming examination.
My dear countrymen, it cannot be a matter of India and it cannot be a matter of festival.
There is hardly any day in our country, which does not have any significance, which has no festival
because we have this heritage of thousands of years old culture .
After a few days the festival of Mahashivaratri is going to come and this time Shivratri is on Monday and when Shivratri is on Monday, its special significance is spread in our mind and temple .
He had discussions on many topics and his confidence was really influential .
During the interaction, when I was talking to one of them, he said, "I am a stage artist, I micry in entertainment programmes, so I asked him whom do you micry"
So he told me that I micry the Prime Minister
So I told them to look at them and I was very pleasant for me, so they microscopyed the way I talk about Mann Ki Baat and microscopy of the mind.
I liked to hear that people not only listen to mind but also remember it on many occasions .
I was really very impressed by the power of that Divya young man .
My dear countrymen, it has been a unique experience for me to join you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
Through the radio , I am in a way from millions of families every month .
Many times you talk to everyone, read your letters or listening to the ideas sent on your phone, I feel like you have accepted me as part of your family.
It has been a very pleasant experience for me .
Friends, Election is the biggest festival of democracy
The next two months, all of us will be busy in the hole of elections.
I myself will be a candidate in this election
Respecting the healthy democratic tradition, the next mind will be on the last Sunday of May
That is, I will start with the strength of your blessings with a new belief after the election with the strength of your blessings and once again I will start with our conversation through Mann Ki Baat and I will continue to talk to you for years.
Once again I express my heartfelt thanks to all of you.
Shri Sri Shivkumar Swami ji, the doctor of Shri Siddhaganga Math of Tumkur district in Karnataka, was not among us.
Shivkumar Swami ji dedicated his entire life to social service
Lord Basaveshwar has taught us that Kayakve Kailas i . e . doing hard work is the same as being in the residence of Lord Shiva, Kailash Dham.
His fame was a scholar who had wonderful hold on English, Sanskrit and Kannada languages
He was a social reformer
He put his whole life in the matter that people get food, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge
Farmers should be well-being in every way. This was a priority in Swamiji's life.
Siddhaganga monastery was regularly organising animal and agricultural fairs .
I have been fortunate to seek the blessings of the supreme god Swami ji several times .
In 2007, our former President, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, visited Tumkur on the occasion of the centenary year celebrations of Shri Shri Shivkumar Swami ji.
Kalam Saheb had narrated a poem for the worshipper Swamiji on this occasion .
This poem of Dr. Kalam Saheb presents the life of Shri Shivakumar Swami ji and the mission of Siddhganga Math beautifully.
Once again, I offer my respect to such a great man.
On January 25, the Election Commission was the founding day celebrated as National Voters Day, National Footers Day.
The people of the world are surprised to see the scale on which elections are held in India and it is natural for every countrymen to be proud of the Election Commission.
There is no stone unturned in our country to ensure that every citizen of India, who is a registered voter, has an opportunity to vote.
It is very natural to be proud of the Election Commission when they listen to these things .
Keeping in mind that voter, that voter gets an opportunity to use his franchise, so that the entire team of employees of the Election Commission goes to the far-flung areas and arranges for voting - and that is the beauty of our democracy.
I appreciate the Election Commission for consistent efforts to strengthen our democracy.
I also appreciate the Election Commission of all States, all security personnel and other employees who participate in the polling process and ensure free and fair elections.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country, this will be the first time that the youth born in the 21st century will use their votes in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have the opportunity to take the responsibility of the country on their shoulders .
Now they are going to be part of the decision process in the country
It's time to connect God's dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register God as a voter if they are eligible to vote
It is my duty to vote together - this feeling should grow within us.
For any reason in life, if you do not vote, there should be great pain.
Sometimes there is something wrong in the country and it should be sad
I urge the well-known celebrities of the country to make people aware about whether we are going to vote together or vote on the day of voting.
I hope a large number of young voters will be registered and their participation will further strengthen our democracy.
My dear countrymen, this great earth of India has given birth to many great men and those great men have done some wonderful and unforgettable work for humanity.
Our country is Bahuratna-Vasundhara
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different style
On the birth anniversary of Netaji, I was fortunate to inaugurate a Museum Museum dedicated to the heroes who contributed to the freedom struggle of India.
You know that many such rooms and buildings were closed since independence inside the Red Fort.
Those closed Red Fort rooms have been converted into very beautiful museums, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and III.
Museum dedicated to Indian National Army
In each brick of these museums, the fragrance of our glorious history lies.
The stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle on the tip of the museum inspires us to go inside history.
At the same place, the brave sons of Bharat Maa, Colonel Prem Sehgal, Colonel Gurbaksh Singh Dhillo and Major General Shahnawaz Khan were prosecuted by the British rule.
When I was visiting the memories related to Netaji in the Red Fort, the Kranti Mandir, the members of Netaji's family presented me a very special cap, cap.
Sometimes Netaji used to wear the same cap
I kept the cap in the museum, so that people coming there should also see the cap and inspire them to patriotism.
In fact , the bravery and patriotism of their heroes needs to be consistently repeated to the new generation .
Just a month ago on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands
In a program, the tricolor was hoisted at the same place, where Netaji Subhash Bose hoisted the tricolor 75 years ago.
Similarly, when the tricolor was hoisted on the Red Fort in October 2018, everyone was surprised because it is a tradition on August 15.
This was the occasion to complete 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government
Subhash Babu will always be remembered as a brave soldier and skilled organizationer
A brave soldier who played an important role in the fight for freedom
Let's go to Delhi, you give me blood, I will give you freedom, like Netaji made a place in the heart of every Indian with strong slogans
For many years it was demanding that files related to Netaji be made public and I am happy that we can do this work.
I remember the day when Netaji's entire family came to the Prime Minister's residence.
Together we spoke a lot about Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhash Bose
I am glad that efforts have been made to develop many places associated with the great heroes of India in Delhi .
Whether it is 26 associated with Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Alipur Road or Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir
If you come to Delhi , you must visit these places .
My dear countrymen, today, when we are discussing about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and that too in Mann Ki Baat, I want to share a story related to Netaji's life with you.
I have always considered the radio as an important medium of connecting with the people, in the same way Netaji also had a deep relationship with the radio and he also chose radio to communicate with the countrymen.
I was told that these radio stations, weekly news bulletins were also broadcast in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
The programmes broadcast on Azad Hind Radio were very popular among the general public and their programmes also strengthened our freedom fighters.
In this Kranti Mandir a visual museum has also been built .
This is an attempt to tell Indian art and culture in a very attractive way .
There are 4 historical ehibitions in the museum and there are more than 450 paintings and art works of three centuries old .
The museum showcases the excellent work of great artists like Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avnindra Nath Tagore, Gaganendra Nath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Roy, Salos Mukherjee.
And I would especially urge you to go there and see the work of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji .
Now you must have been thinking that the matter is happening here and I am talking to you about the excellent works of Gurudev Tagore.
You have so far known Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore as a writer and a musician .
But I would like to tell that Gurudev was also a painter .
And the special thing is that Gurudev Tagore did not give any name to most of his works
He believed that his painting watcher himself understood that painting, know the message given by him in painting from his perspective.
Their paintings have been displayed in European countries , Russia and America too .
I hope you will definitely visit their paintings at the Kranti Mandir.
My dear countrymen, India is the land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their ideas and actions.
There was such a saint - Sant Ravidas
Ravidas Jayanti is on February 19
The two of Sant Ravidas ji is very famous .
Sant Ravidas ji gave a big message through a few lines .
He had said that there is a caste in the caste, which is the caste of Ketan, Raidas Man can not connect unless the caste is snatched the banana temper, then under the leaves, the leaves under the leaves and finally nothing comes out, but the entire tree ends, just likewise, humans have been divided into castes and humans have not been there.
They used to say that if God is indeed in every human being, then it is not appropriate to divide them on caste, creed and other social grounds.
Guru Ravidas ji was born on the holy land of Varanasi
Sant Ravidas ji through his messages tried to explain the importance of labour and labour during his lifetime .
It will not be wrong to say that they have explained the real meaning of the prestige of labour to the world .
He used to say that if the heart is fun , then in the Kathoti Ganga meaning if your mind and heart are sacred , then God lives in your heart .
The messages of Sant Ravidas ji have influenced every section of the people of every class, whether it is the Maharaja and the queen of Chittor or the Meerabai, everyone was his followers.
I once again bow down to Sant Ravidas ji
My dear countrymen, Kiran Sidar has written on MyGov to highlight the aspects of Indias space programme and its future.
He also wants me to urge the students to take interest in space programmes and go ahead with the sky - Kiran ji, I appreciate your ideas and specially the message given to our children.
A few days ago, I was in Ahmedabad, where I got the opportunity to unveil the statue of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai.
Our space programme contributes to innumerable young scientists of the country.
We are proud of the fact that satellites and sounding rockets developed by our students are reaching space today.
On this 24th January the Kalam set created by our students has been launched.
Sounding Rockets created by university students in Odisha have also made many records.
The number of space missions that have been launched since the independence of the country till 2014, almost the same space mission has started in the last four years.
We have also created a world record of launching 104 satellites simultaneously from the same spacecraft.
We will soon register the presence of India on the moon through the Chandrayaan-2 campaign.
Our country is also using space technology to protect the property.
Whether it is cyclone or rail and road safety, all these are getting a lot of help from space technology.
NAI Devices have been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which are helpful in their security as well as economic progress.
We are using space technology to improve the delivery and accountability of government services.
Housing for All i. e.
Along with this, about three and a half million properties were also geo-tagged under MNREGA
Our satellites today symbolize the growing power of the country
It has a great contribution to our better relations with many countries of the world.
South Asia Satellites has been a unique initiative that has gifted development to our neighbouring friendly nations.
Through its extremely competitive launch services, India today launches satellites not only of developing countries but also of developed countries.
The heavens and stars are always very attractive for children .
Our space program gives children an opportunity to think big and move beyond the boundaries which were so far considered impossible.
This is a vision of watching the stars for our children as well as inspiring to find new stars.
My dear countrymen, I always say that those players who have played and all the young and young players have come forward in Khelo India this time.
About 6,000 players participated in 18 Games at Khelo India Youth Games in Pune in January
When the local ecosystem of our sports will be strengthened, that is, when our base will be strengthened then our youth will be able to perform the best of their capabilities in the country and the world.
This time players from every state have performed well at their respective levels in Khelo India.
The life of many medal winners is very inspiring .
They live in a parking shed with their family
At the same time, Maharashtra's Under-21 Women's Kabadi team's captain Sonali Helvi Satara is a resident of
He lost his father at a very young age and his brother and his mother encouraged the skill of Sonali .
It is often seen that daughters do not get so much encouragement in sports like Kabdi .
Despite this Sonali chose Kabadi and performed excellently .
Abhinav Shaw, 10 years of Asansol, is the youngest gold medal winner in Khelo India Youth Games
Akshata Baswani Kamati, a farmer's daughter from Karnataka wins Gold in Weightlitting
He credited his victory to his father and his father is a farmer in Belgaum.
When we are talking about the creation of India then it is the New India of the resolve of youth power.
These stories of Khelo India are telling us that the people of big cities are not only contributing to the creation of a New India but also the youth from small towns, villages and towns, young sporting talents.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard about many prestigious beauty contests.
But have you heard about the toilet brightening content
Hey, more than 50 lakh toilets have also participated in this unique content that has been running for the last nearly a month.
The name of this unique contest is clean beautiful toilets.
People are making their toilets clean as well as making them beautiful by making some paintings. You will also get to see all the photographs social media from Kashmir to Kanyakumari Kutch to Kamrup.
I call upon all Sarpanches and Village Heads to lead this campaign in their Panchayats.
Please share photos of your clean beautiful toilets on social media with MylatGhar
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we had started a memorable journey together to make our country clean and free from open defecation.
In collaboration with the people of India, India is moving towards open defecation long before 2nd October, 2019 to pay homage to Bapu on his 150th birth anniversary.
This memorable journey of Swachh Bharat has also contributed a lot to the audience of Mann Ki Baat and that is why you all are happy to share that more than 5 lakh 50 thousand villages and 600 districts have declared themselves Open Defecation Free and Swachhta Coverage 98 in rural India and nearly nine crore families have been provided toilet facilities.
My little friends, the days of exams are coming.
Anshull Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, has written on MyGov that I should talk about examinations and am careers
Anshull ji, thank you for raising this issue
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is Ham Season
