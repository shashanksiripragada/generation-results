Mann Ki Baat October 2019
My dear countrymen, you are greeted.
Today is the holy day of Diwali.
Today, Diwali is being celebrated in many countries of the world.
The specialty of the festival is that not only Indian society but also the governments and citizens of various countries, the social organisations and Diwali celebrate with joy and joy.
So there is a subtle world of India.
Friends, Tourist Festival has its own attraction for festivals in the world.
In our country, every region has its own diversity, and people from other countries are specially interested in them.
Therefore, in India, the role of Indians living outside the country in promoting festival tourism is very important.
My dear countrymen, we have decided to do something different to this Diwali in the last Mann Ki Baat.
I said, Come together, let us celebrate Diwali this time the women's strength and achievements of India, that is, we can honour the Laxmi of India.
Look, soon the innumerable inspiring stories in the society appeared very much.
Write on the Namo App, the sculpture of Warangal, my mother is my strength.
When my father died in 1990, my mother took responsibility for five children.
Today, we have five brothers engaged in good work.
My best wishes to your mother.
Geetika Swami, who is an actor in the film, says that she is the daughter of the bus conductor, Major Kushbu Kanwar Bharat Lakshmi, led by the Al-Wiman section of Assam Rifles.
The poet Tiwari has his daughter Bharatlakshmi and his own strength.
They are proud that their daughter is a good painter.
The girl got a good rank in the CAT exam.
On the other hand, Megha Jayan writes about an old age of 92, who has been providing free drinking water to Gwalior Railway Station for years.
Meghazi, the generosity and compassion of this Bharat Laxmi is very inspiring.
Many such stories have been shared by people.
You must read, inspire and share your closest things...
The emotions of that poem, and the words of that poem, are now written in the fifteenth century.
How great words, how great emotional, how good thought is in this poetry of Kannada.
Painida Permegondanu Himavantan Penindida Bhrigu Perchidanu Penindida Janakrayanu Jasulidanu, the mountainous king Himawan, because of his daughter Parvati, Bhrigumuni, because of his daughter Laxmi, the King of Jana King became famous because of his daughter Sita.
Our daughters are our pride.
The greatness of these daughters is a strong personality for our society and a bright future.
Dear countrymen, on 12th November, 2019, the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
I've never forgotten my visit to the Gurudwaras of Vanquer and Tehran.
I have a lot of things related to Shri Guru Nanak Dev, who can share with you, but it will take several episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
He stands firm on many evils like touch.
Shri Guru Nanak Devji sent his message far away from the world.
He was the most traveller at that time.
Everybody's heart was fainted by his luck and humility and the behavior of the common man when he went to various places.
The great religious journey of Guru Nanak Dev ji is said to be Udasi.
With the message of harmony and equality, he went to the north, south, east and west, and saw people, saints and sages directly everywhere.
The famous saint Shankardev of Assam is also considered to be inspired by him.
Rajgir related to Buddhism went to pilgrimages like Gaya.
In South India, Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji has gone to Sri Lanka.
During the journey to Beedar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water there.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Jira Saheb in Beedar, which is dedicated to Guru Nanak Devji.
During such a journey, Guru Nanak ji travelled in north India in Kashmir and in the environment.
This has established a strong link between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji went to Tibet and the people there considered him a guru.
He's a worshipper in Uzbekistan, who has gone.
During his visit, he has also visited Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
He embraced the minds of millions of people, followed by his suggestions with great respect, even today.
A few days ago, diplomatic delegates from around 85 countries went to Amritsar via Delhi.
There he visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar and celebrated the 550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Devji.
There, these diplomats also got the opportunity to visit the Golden Temple and know about the Sikh tradition and culture.
Thereafter, several ambassadors shared their pictures in the community and wrote with great pride about the best experiences.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am sure you will remember on October 31.
Today, Korta is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the steel man of India, on the lines of unity in this country.
Sardar Patel had a surprising ability to unite the people and was also fighting emotionally with those who had different opinions.
Sardar Patel was watching and learning every small thing deeply.
He was the personality of analysis in the true sense.
In addition to this, the organizational capabilities were also enhanced.
He has been skilled in formulating projects and improving war strategies.
While reading and listening to Sardar Saheb's style of functioning, I understand how deep his preparation was.
Thousands of people came from all over the country to participate in the General Congress General Assembly in Ahmedabad in 1921.
Patel was responsible for all the arrangements related to the Mahasama Mela.
He used this opportunity to improve the water supply system in the city.
Nobody's got a problem with water.
He was associated with the farmers and asked them to build Khadi bags.
The farmers made a bag and sold it to the representatives.
The delegates don't have the fear of stealing shoes because they kept shoes in these bags.
On the other hand, Khadi sales also increased significantly.
Our country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for his contribution to the Constitutional Constituent Assembly.
He spoke of the importance of ensuring fundamental rights, thereby ensuring that there is no possibility of any kind of difference in caste and capitalism.
Friends, We know that as the first Home Minister of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has made a decisive endeavour to unite the nations and make history decreasing.
It was Sardar Vallabhbhai's specialty to remember everything.
After the partition of India in 1947, our neighbour's eyes fell on Lakshadweep and they shipped there with the flag of that country.
As soon as the attention was noticed, Sardar Patel, without losing a short time, started a drastic step.
He directed the brothers of Arkot Ramaswamy and Arkot Laxmanaswamy and others to take the people from Thiruvananthapuram to Lakshadweep and to highlight the Tricolour Flag on Lakshadweep first and wish to fly the Tricolour Flag on Lakshadweep.
Soon, the Tricolour Flag was blown there and the neighbourhood of Lakshadweep's neighbourhood looked at the ground.
After this incident, Sardar Patel advised the brothers to ensure that all necessary assistance is available for the development of Lakshadweep.
Today, Lakshadweep is playing an important role in the development of India.
This is a very attractive tourist spot .
I hope you and these beautiful islands and coasts will visit.
Dear countrymen, on 31st October 2018, I had dedicated the Statue of Unity to the nation and the world in memory of Sardar Patel.
It's the highest statue in the world.
The Statue of Liberty in America has doubled the height.
The highest statue in the world is proud of every Indian.
The heads of every Indian are proud.
You will be happy to see more than 26 lakh visitors of the Statue of Unity within a year.
I am sure the people there have started the farming of dragon fruits, which will also change the main source of livelihood of the people there.
Friends, This Statue of Unit can be a study for all the states and for the tourism industry for the country.
We have witnessed how a place is developing as a world famous tourist destination within a year.
There are people from the country and abroad.
Several arrangements are developing on their own in one after another, including travel facilities, housing, guides, environment friendly arrangements.
The government is also playing its role.
Friends, On the last day, Time Magazine will be an Indian who is not proud to have given the Statue of Unity a great place in the 100 great tourist destinations of the world.
I hope you're going to see the Statue of Unity by changing your time from your precious time.
However, my request to all Indians who have spent time for the journey is to go to at least 15 tourist destinations and stay at night.
Friends, As you know, every year since 2014, we celebrate the National Unity Day on 31st October.
On this day, we have a message to save the unity, integrity and security of our country at all costs.
On 31st October, the Organisation for Unit is being organised every time.
This will include people from all sections of the society and from all levels.
This is a symbol of the country's unity, which goes to the same direction and wants to achieve the same goal.
Similarly, there is a special interest and zeal among the people in Marthon.
The Run Phone Unit is also a beautiful opportunity for it.
Run is beneficial for mind, mind and body.
Therefore, not only the body but also the unity of the mind and the cultural India and the unity of India to new heights.
That's why you live in any city, you can find out where the Fore Unit is going next.
I hope you and you will surely run your fitness for the unity of India on October 31.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel laid the foundation of the unity of the country.
Dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and aware of strengthening the unity and mutual harmony of the country.
If we look at ourselves, we can see many examples of consistent efforts to enhance mutual harmony.
However, sometimes the problems of the society, its contributions and the eradication of memory are regular.
A lot of people from different kinds went to the ground.
All kinds of parties have been playing sports to achieve their own way from the environment.
What kind of language has been spoken to make the environment warm
Efforts have been made to replace different voices.
We recall what some advocators and some advocacy have said to be self-employed, what kind of illegitimate things have been said.
Honourfully respected the dignity of the court and did not allow anywhere to create an environment that warms the society and enhances pressure.
These things must always be remembered, which gives us a lot of strength.
Those days, these moments give us a sense of duties.
This is an example of how great the heaven of unity is giving to the country.
It was a big blow to the country.
I pay homage to that great man today.
My dear countrymen, if you hear a story from home to home today, if you can hear a story from every village, from the north to the south, from the east to the west, from every corner of India, then it is about cleanliness.
Every individual, every family and every village has been inspired to share their comfortable experience of cleanliness because this effort is an effort of 125 crore Indians for sanitation.
The rights of its consequences are only 125 crore Indians.
But it's also a pleasant and attractive experience.
I'm listening to you.
The world's highest battlefield, the temperature is 50-60 degrees mines.
In the air, there's only a place named Oxygen.
In such a negative environment, it is a great adventurous thing to live in the middle of such challenges.
In such a completely opposite environment, our brave men are not only boundaries with their breasts but also undertaking a programme called Swachh Siachen.
We know these Siachen ice rocks are the source of rivers and clean water.
Therefore, the cleanliness campaign here means that the people living in the valley should ensure clean water and they use water in rivers such as Nubra and Shiok.
Dear countrymen, the festival is an opportunity to awaken the curiosity of ourselves.
If Deepalik is buying something specially, and bringing something from the market is going on at least in the family.
I once told you to try to buy local goods.
If we get the things we need in our village then we don't need to go to Taluk.
If you get to Taluk, you don't need to go to the district.
As much as we can try to buy local goods, Gandhi will become a great opportunity for himself.
We have to buy something that our khadi nets have been made with the hands of our weaver.
I urge you to buy local goods with the best wishes of Diwali.
Look, we will be able to play an important role in fulfilling the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
But sometimes due to carelessness there is burning.
There may be cracks.
I urge you to regulate yourself and celebrate the festival with enthusiasm.
My best wishes.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Batt, September 2018
No Indian will be proud of our Armed Forces and our soldiers.
Every Indian will always be enthusiastic to express his joy and support to our soldiers, whether in any region or in any caste or in any language.
Yesterday, 250 crore people of India were celebrated with pride as the day of the tradition of our armed forces.
We recalled the Surgical Strake in 2016, and that day our soldiers responded to those who were proud of the war against terrorism against our nation.
Our Armed Forces exhibitions have been organized in different parts of the country with the vision of more and more citizens, especially the younger generation, to know what is our strength.
We are talented and we want to know how our soldiers save their lives and save the people.
The day like Parakram Mountain reminds the youth of the pride of our Armed Forces.
It inspires us to ensure the unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of heroes.
Our army is sure to respond to those who are trying to free the atmosphere of peace in our country.
India has always been committed to peace and dedication.
In the 20th century, over one lakh of our soldiers sacrificed great sacrifices for peace in the two world wars.
We must remember that we had no connection with that war.
It was in the mercenaries of our soldiers for peace.
Even today, India is one of the most armed countries of United Nations peacekeeping forces.
Our brave soldiers have been playing an important role in establishing peace in the world by wearing blue helmets for decades.
My dear people, the things in the sky are different.
We celebrate Air Force Day on 8th October.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the air warriors and their families who have served for the country.
When the invaders from Pakistan began a sudden attack in 1947, the Air Force only ensured that Indian soldiers and war equipment came to the battleground to protect Srinagar from the invaders.
The Air Force also responded in 1965 to the enemies.
Nobody knows about the 1971 freedom struggle.
In 1999, the role of the Air Force in evacuating Kargil from cross-borders has remained unsuccessful.
At Tiger Hill, the Air Force attacked the enemies camps in the night and ruined them.
I am gratitude to the Air Force for commendable efforts made by our Air Force personnel, whether it is a rescue operation or a rescue mission of accidents.
India can proudly say that in the armed forces, not only men's strength, but also women's power.
He was also worried about how to save Tommy.
You know Abhilas Tommy is a very brave hero.
He is the first Indian to travel the world with a small boat without the help of a modern technology alone.
In the last 80 days, he continued his journey in the ocean to participate in the Golden Global Race in the South Indian Ocean, but the terrible ocean cyclone caused him an accident.
However, the valour of the Indian Navy has been fighting for several days in the sea.
He was in the midst of the sea without eating and drinking anything.
I wasn't ready to agree to defeat life.
A wonderful example of courage, determination and cruelty - when I had saved aspiration from the sea, I spoke on telephone.
His courage, valour, determination, courage and victory will definitely inspire the younger generation of our country.
Dear countrymen, everyone knows what is the significance of October 2 for our nation.
On October 2 this year, there is a great significance.
For two years from now on, we are going to organize various programmes across the world on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have inspired the entire world.
Later in 1945, when the freedom struggle was strengthened, he revised the ideas and prepared a new edition.
His thoughts have been placed in front of the people about the rights of the revered Bapu farmers, the villages and the workers and many issues such as cleanliness and education.
This is also called Gandhi Charter.
Possibly Bapu was a gathering.
It was Baba's specialty to join people and combine them, which was his habit.
It has been experienced by everyone as the greatest characteristic of his personality.
He convinced every individual that the person is the greatest and ever-needed person for the country.
His greatest contribution to the freedom struggle is that he has made it a massive commemoration.
As per the call of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle, the people of all sections of the society have dedicated themselves.
Gandhiji says that I'm giving you a mantra.
You'll feel that you're unconscious, and you're unconscious.
My dear countrymen, this mantra of Gandhiji is as great as it is today.
Today, the growing middle class in the country should consider one thing based on their economic strength and growing efficiency.
Can we remember the worshipped father for a minute when we go to buy something
Can you remember that mantra of the priest father
Can you imagine what citizen of the country is accomplished by what I buy
Whose face will enjoy
Who can be directly or indirectly benefited by you buying it
I'll be very happy if the poorest of the poor gets benefitted.
This is Gandhiji's mantra, this is Gandhiji's message and I am confident that a small step in the life of the poorest and weakest person will make a big change.
Friends, Gandhiji said that if the campus was cleaned then it would have been possible that he couldn't even know how it was.
But it happened, India got freedom.
Likewise, we can see how our country is contributing to economic growth, economic empowerment and strengthening the poverty against poverty.
But I believe it would be the true patriotism of today's era.
It is said that Lal Bahadur Shastri used to keep the old and dressed clothes of Khadi, because somebody's hard work was lost in it.
He said these khadi clothes are made very hard and should be used in every corner of it.
This feeling of tea and affection for the people of the country was full of every corner of the small and long great man.
After two days, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Scientists with Poojaya Bapu.
As soon as the name of Scientific Ji comes, the people of India will be brilliant in our minds.
His generous personality is always proud of the people.
Besides, he looks very humble but he was a strong personality like a mountain inside him, the specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri ji.
The mirror of his Jai Jawan Jai Kisan shows his unique personality.
He gave a mantra to the soldiers and farmers of the country to reach the peak of success in the narrow reign of nearly one and a half years of narrow rule as a reflection of his selfless penance towards the nation.
People from all over the country are associated with this effort of the 15th Atiti.
If you don't have phones on this topic, you cannot even have such a heart-to-to-facility.
I want to thank you specially for the phone.
The concluding Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will commence on 2nd October 2018 with the commencement of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Baba.
My dear countrymen, there is a book in Sanskrit that is Swarajya Swasthya.
In the Constitution given by Babasaheb Ambedkar, several provisions have been made to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission was constituted on 12th October, 1993.
Within a few days, the Commission is completing its 25 years.
The Human Rights Commission has not only defended human rights but also enhanced human dignity.
The former Prime Minister of our country, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has clearly stated that humanity is not an unprecedented concept for us.
During this 25-year visit, this institution created an atmosphere of idea and faith among the people.
I believe that this is a very negative event for the best democratic values of a healthy society.
Today, Human Rights Commissions have been set up in 26 states along with national human rights activities.
As a society, we need to understand the rights of humanity and bring it to work, this is the basis of Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas, Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vikas.
My dear countrymen, if the birth anniversary of Jaiprakash Narayan is coming in the month of October, then don't remember that the birth centenary year of Rajmata Vijayaraj Sindhi begins.
These great personalities are very inspired by us and bow down to them.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the next Manki Baat will be spoken in detail, but for a few years, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, on 31st October, the Run for Unity is being organized in all small towns, villages and streets in India.
This year too, there will be an opening unit in our villages, streets, cities and cities.
This is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he worked for the unity of the nation throughout his life.
On October 31, we should focus on our efforts to cover all sections of the society and all components of the country on the lines of unity.
Thank you.
Mann Ki Baat August 2018
Today, Rakshabandhan is celebrating all over the country.
My best wishes to all the people on this holy day.
Raksha Bandhan is believed to be a symbol of mutual love and faith of brothers and sisters.
This festival is a great example of social harmony for centuries.
In the history of the country, there are a number of stories that enlighten the people of two different countries and religions on the lines of faith.
In a few days, Janmashtami celebrations have started.
Best wishes to all the people of Rakshabandhan and Janmashtami.
Friends, Besides Rakshabandhan, Sanskrit Day is celebrated on the occasion of Shravan Purnima.
I congratulate all those who have been involved in developing this great legacy and reaching the common man.
We are very proud that Tamil is the oldest language in the world, and from Vedic times to today, cultural language has played a big role in the spread of wisdom.
You will be happy to know that the residents of Matur village of Shimoga district of Karnataka are still talking to each other in cultural languages.
Therefore, in any minute, micro emotions or subjects can be explained properly.
At the same time, it is very easy to understand because it is linked to our soil and our tradition.
For instance, it is said to convince the importance of the Guru in life - Akmapi Learning Guru, Shishya, Prabodhyet Prithvivya, Nasti Tadddavya, Yad-Datwahyanri Bhavet.
He recalled Sarva Bharati Radhakrishnan.
His birth anniversary is celebrated as Teachers Day all over the country.
I extend my best wishes to all teachers in the country on the coming Teachers Day.
At the same time, I congratulate you for your dedication to science, education and students.
Friends, Our farmers who have worked hard for the years come with new expectations.
Rainfall provides relief to plants, trees and dry reservoirs in the severe summer.
But sometimes the storm and the devastating floods come along.
At some places, there is more rain than rains.
We have already seen that the terrible flood in Kerala has affected the lives of the people in a very serious way.
Today, in this calamity, the entire country is with Kerala.
We're sympathetic to those who lost their own.
Though the loss of lives cannot be solved, I would like to assure the sad families that 250 crore Indians are on their shoulders during this sad moment.
I pray that those injured in this natural calamity will recover as soon as possible.
I am sure that Kerala will blossom due to the enthusiasm and indomitable courage of the people.
It is unfortunate that the losses that are being removed from the accidents are unfortunate.
But we can see how many scenes of humanity at the time of danger.
Everyone is doing something in their own way from Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari to make the lives normal where there is an accident in Kerala or any other state in Hindustan or district or region.
In every age, every workforce plays its own role.
Everyone is making a contribution to the hardships of the people of Kerala and to share their sorrows.
We know that the Armed Forces personnel are leading the rescue operations in Kerala.
They tried their best to save the people of the flood.
My dear countrymen, this time we were examining the suggestions received from Mann Ki Baat.
The topic written by more people across the country was Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the beloved of all of us.
Kirti from Gaziabad, Swati from Sonipat, Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Dream Banerjee from West Bengal, Ahresh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar and many others have written the Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov on the various steps in the life of Atal ji.
Saddened when the country and the world heard the death anniversary of Atal ji on August 16.
14 years ago, the Prime Minister was elected leader of the nation.
In a way, he had been away from active politics for the last 10 years.
The news didn't take place, and didn't appear in public life.
The gap of 10 years is very big, but after August 16, the country and the world have seen that the period of ten years in the minds of the common people of India has not made a minute gap.
The kind of affection and respect to Atal ji, the sorrow that spreads all over the country, shows his broad personality.
India will always be contributed to Atal ji in the name of the 99th Constitution Amendment of 2003.
This change has made two major changes in Indian politics.
First, the size of the Cabinet in the States has been fixed at 15 of the total number of seats.
Secondly, the limit determined under the Prevention of Criminalization Act has been changed to one-third to two.
At the same time, clear guidelines have been made to disqualify the parties.
Over the years, there has been a political culture that has been formed in India for a large number of years and the formation of big cabinets was not divided by departments but to enjoy political leaders.
Atal ji changed it.
He waited for money and resources at this step.
And more efficiency.
This transformation was the vision of a person like Atal ji and our political culture and healthy habits have grown.
Atal ji was a foolish patriot.
During his tenure, there was a change in the presentation of the budget.
Earlier, the budget was presented at 5:00 in the evening following the tradition of the British, as it was the time for the Parliament to begin in England.
Atal ji's presentation of the budget in 2001 was from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.
One more freedom - the Indian Flag Code was built during the reign of Atal ji and it was authorized in 2002.
Divisions involve national flag hoisting at public places.
It's a good thing and good news for democracy.
It will be a good tribute to Atal ji for a healthy democracy, for a good democracy, to develop good habits, to constantly strive to strengthen democracy and to take forward discussions with an open mind.
Reiterating his commitment to fulfil his dream of a developed and prosperous India, I pay homage to Atal ji for all.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament ended a few days ago.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha (Productivity) is 118 and the Rajya Sabha is 74.
Besides the interest of the party, all the members have passed 21 Bills in the Lok Sabha and 14 Bills in the Rajya Sabha as a result of their efforts to make the Monsoon Session effective.
This year's session of Parliament will always be remembered as a conclave of social justice and goodwill for the youth.
During the session, important bills for the benefit of youth and backward communities were passed.
For decades, the need for the formation of the OBC Commission was increasing like the Scheduled Tribes Commission.
In order to ensure the rights of Backward Classes, this time, the country has successfully decided to form the OBC Commission and gave it constitutional authority.
This step will become a step ahead of the goal of social justice.
The Amendment Bill has also been passed in the session for ensuring rights of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
The law will protect the welfare of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
In addition, it will prevent the criminals from injuring them, and will fill confidence within the constraints.
There is no unjust and cultural society in any way against women's power in the country.
The country is not ready to tolerate the guilty.
Therefore, the Parliament passed the Penal Code Amendment Bill and ensured strict punishment.
You might have read in the paper a few days ago that the person who has been adulterated with an adult child has been asked for a two-month trial in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh completed the trial in five days and sentenced the culprits.
The court of Rajasthan also took such a quick decision.
The Act will play an excellent role in preventing crimes against women and girls.
Without social change, economic progress is incomplete.
However, it could not be passed in this Rajya Sabha session and I would like Muslim women to assure that the entire country stands firmly to justice them.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the MPs of the country on this occasion.
Friends, Crores of people are now focused on the Asian Games in Jakarta.
Every day in the morning, in the press, in the television, in the news, in the social media, the Indian sportsperson has won a medal.
The Asian Games are still running.
Congratulations to all the medal winners for the country.
Our girls are very well-known among the medal winners for the country, this is a very positive sign.
The young sportspersons of the medal are 15-16 years old.
It is also a good sign that most of the medal winners live in small streets and villages and have achieved this success through hard work.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners in the Asian Games and wish the rest of the sportspersons to show good performance.
My best wishes to everyone on National Sports Day.
Namaskaram Bhavnaji, I respect the thoughts of the child.
We have seen the construction of stones, wooden houses and buildings, but can you imagine the construction of a magnificent, large and magnificent temple on a mountain that was a single rock about 1200 years ago Perhaps it is difficult to imagine.
However, the Brihadeshwar temple in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, where this unbelievable coordination of architecture and engineering can be seen.
The Westerners who are known as Rani Ki Wave, built in the 11th century in the place of Pan in Gujarat, will surprise anyone.
The land of India was an engineering laboratory.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
M.
He is a priest in that part of the country and the rest of the country remembers him with great respect and sovereignty.
In his memory, September 15 is celebrated as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, engineers of our country have shown their unique personality all over the world.
Now, when we celebrate Engineers Day, we have to think about the future.
We have to do workshops there.
Nowadays the Disaster Management has become a big deal.
The world is facing natural calamities.
In this situation, what form should be structural engineering
How can we prioritize manufacturing without garbage
We have to think about many such things when we celebrate Engineering Day.
See you again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
The landscape and diversity of India sometimes shows the pleasures of rain.
But why do we blame the rain
V.
In Thailand, the football players took 12 children's team to the cave during their coaching.
It'll take a few hours to go inside and get out of the cave.
Because they couldn't find any other way, they took shelter on a small rock inside the cave - that's not one or two days, for 18 days.
If the children see death in front, you can see how the moments will be when they have to live directly every moment.
On the one hand, they were straightening the accident, on the other hand, human values were manifesting together human beings in the world.
People all over the world are praying for safely evacuating these children.
But when the last good news came, the world was calm and happy.
But I feel like seeing this incident in another way.
Everyone participated in the mission for a team.
I think it is a matter of learning and understanding of the restraint of everybody.
In this initiative, a young man of the Thailand Navy had to sacrifice his life.
It is surprising that the world is surprised that even in such a difficult environment, the water-filled cave has no hope with such courage and forgiveness.
It shows that miracles happen when humanity is united.
It was a special feature of Neeraj jis poems to shout hope, faith, determination and confidence.
Everything we have said to the Indians is strong and inspirational.
It's dark.
I pay homage to Shri Neeraj Ji.
Namaste Prime Minister, my name is true.
I have been a first year student in Delhi University this year.
At the time of our school board exams, we spoke about the tension and education of your exams and what is your message to students like me
The months of July and August are very important for the farmers and for the youth.
Because it's called the Peak Season of Colleges.
This is the time when millions of youngsters like truth go from school to college.
In February and March, exam papers and answers, there is a time to play holidays in April May, and to wait for a result, to decide further directions in life and choose a career.
Children come from the shadow of their parents to the shadow of professionals.
I am confident that my young friends will be very enthusiastic and happy from the beginning of life.
For the first time, we got out of the house, we got out of the village, we got out of a safe environment and we had to be controlled.
So many youngsters have left their homes for the first time to give a new direction to their lives.
Many students must have joined their colleges and some will be ready to join.
I want to tell you to be calm, enjoy life, know the joy of the soul in life.
There is no way to learn but through books, but there is a habit of finding new things.
The price of old friends is very big.
The childhood friends are not foolish, but the finding, building and maintaining of new friends is a matter of consciousness in their own way.
Learn something new, get new skills, learn new languages.
Now, while talking about the season, a student from a very poor family in Madhya Pradesh, Ashram Chaudhari, was watching the news of how he had won and won the challenges of life.
There are so many students who have been inspiring for all of us in such a way that they are from the poor family and from the challenging environment, from their hard work and dedication.
Father DDC driver Prince Kumar in Delhi, Abhay Gupta, who is studying under Street Light in Footpath in Kolkata, and daughter of Afrien Sheikh, father Afrien Shaikh in Ahmedabad, is greetings and gratitude to the daughter of the school bus driver, Khushi in Nagpur, the daughter of the school bus driver, Kartik in Haryana, the father's guardian, Kartik in Haryana, and the father-in-law of Jharkhand.
If we look around, we can see many examples like this.
Any good event in any corner of the country gives me energy and inspiration.
I was interacting with the Indian youth at Sanjos city, once known as the Technology Hub in America.
I told them how they can use their talent for India and do something in time.
I urge the brain drain to convert brain drain into brain gene.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji have made a different effort by adopting this challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji together prepared a Smart Gaw App with their professional skills.
This app not only connects the people of the village to the world but also makes them know any information and information on their own mobile.
The villagers of Taudhakpur village in Rai Barreli, inspired the people to use this app, the village head, the district magistrate and the CDO.
This App is a way to bring a digital revolution in the village and it is easier to record, track and monitor all the development works in the villages.
The App has all the phone directory, news sections, events lists, health centres and information centres in the village.
This App is very beneficial for the farmers and the farmers of the App's Grameen Feature and the Fact Rate is in a way used as a market for their produce.
If you look at this event, you will see that the young man lives in the United States in his lifestyle and thoughts in the United States and leaves India several years ago, but he knows from every corner of his village, understands the challenges and possesses an emotional relationship with the village.
But sometimes due to lack of time, sometimes because of the distance, sometimes because of the environment, the thin layer of the cheek is closed on it, but if a small canal touches it then all things appear once again, it takes it to the past.
Santoshji, thank you for your phone call.
Of course, Parampur Vari is a very wonderful pilgrimage.
Friends, Asha Ekadashi is being celebrated this time on July 23.
Parampur is a sacred city of Solapur district of Maharashtra.
Approximately 15-20 days before the ASHA Akademi, the pilgrims go out on foot with the teeth of Parampur.
Millions of newspapers are participating in this journey called Vari.
Pilgrims reach there for the darshan of Vithoba and Vithoba, called Vithoba and Panduranga.
God leaves the poor, the deprived and the afflicted.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have immense respect and devotion.
It is a different experience of going to the Vitthoba temple in Pamppur and its greatness, beauty and spiritual enjoyment.
Once I get the opportunity to tell the listeners of Manki Baat, I must participate in Parpur Bari once.
Innumerable pilgrims like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still informing the common people of Maharashtra.
The tradition of this saint is inspiring every corner of India to fight blind respect.
It is a message of affection, affection and brotherhood from all the behaviours related to them.
There is a mantra of fighting the society with respect to blind respect.
The worldman was a person full of courage and confidence.
He had the power and understanding of the British rulers to mislead them.
He was scared by the British to try to impose treason trigger three times within twenty years.
It's not a little thing.
I would like to present a funny event in front of you about Lokmanya Tilak and one of his statues in Ahmedabad.
In October 1916, when he reached Ahmedabad, about a hundred years ago, more than 40,000 people came here to welcome him and during this journey Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel got the opportunity to talk to him.
Lokmanya Tilak had greatly influenced Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.
Naturally, the British dissatisfied with it and the Collector continued to admit it.
However, Sardar Saheb was Sardar Saheb and he remained firm and had to leave his position, he was determined to establish the statue of the Lokmanyatilak.
The statue was finally constructed and inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 1929.
The Ganesh Festival has been started as a result of the efforts of the Lokmanya Tilakar.
The Ganesh Festival was celebrated with traditional respect and festivals and became a strong medium of social awakening, social awareness, equality and equality among the people.
It was a time to unite to fight the British in the country.
It shows that our ancient heritage and our brave men of history still have interest in our younger generation.
Today, you can see Ganesh Mandaps in many cities and streets.
This is a good opportunity for our youth to learn about leadership and organizational understanding and develop its capabilities.
This time, from the idol of Ganesh to the decoration of decorations, it should be environment friendly and there should be competition of environment friendly Ganesh festival in every city.
I'll definitely bring all this to the people.
Lokmanyatilak has made the people self-confidence, becomes a mirror, Swaraj is our birth rights and will achieve it.
Even today, it is time to say that Swaraj is our right to live.
Every Indian should have good results of good governance and development.
This is to build a New India.
On the same day, 50 years after the birth of Tilak, i.e. on 23rd July, another son of Bharatamba was born.
He sacrificed his life assuming that we should breathe the climate of freedom.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
Any young man will be inspired to hear these lines and many youngsters like Sarfaroshi Ki Tamana Ab Hamare Dil Me Haidekhana Hai Jor Kitana, Baju-e-Kat Mae Hai have been inspired by Ashfaq Unah Khan, Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azad's courage and his enthusiasm for freedom inspired many youngsters.
Azad lost his life, but he never bowed his head to foreign rule.
A few days ago, the Junior Under 20 World Athletic Championship held in Finland created history by winning the gold medal of the brave women and farmer daughter Hima Das of India at the 400m race.
Answering to me the fear of our second daughter Ekta, I got e-mail by telling me that preparations for the Asian Games are going on from Indonesia.
Email writes Unity: The most important moment in the life of an athlete is the Tricolour Flag and I am proud that I have achieved this.
Unity, we're all proud of it.
The name of unity is bright.
In Tunisia, World Para Athletic Grand Price 2018 won Unity Gold and Bronze medals.
I salute the fear of unity, Yogeshi Kuttya and Sundarsingh in the name of your courage.
In the month of August, the patriotic devotion of all of you to be healthy, I extend my best wishes to you on the occasion of several festivals that have been held for centuries.
Once again, you can gather in Mann Ki Baat.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2018
A few days ago, a cricket match was held in Bangalore.
You can clearly understand that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
The two teams performed well in this game.
Bowler Rashid Khan from Afghanistan also showcased a good exhibition this year in the IPL.
I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, tagged me and said, "The people of Afghanistan are proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I am grateful to my Indian friends for preparing a platform for our sportspersons to showcase their talent.
Rashid Khan represents the greatest sportspersons in Afghanistan.
The Indian team has done something that is a model for the whole world.
At the time of buying Indian team Trophy, the first time he called the Afghan team to participate in the International Competition and took photographs together.
My best wishes to the teams of India and Afghanistan.
I am sure we will continue to participate in sports with each others vibrant sportsman spirit.
My dear countrymen, this fourth Yoga Day, which was held on 21st June, presented a unique sight.
I see the whole world being united.
In the high snowy peak of Ladakh, the soldiers of India and China conducted Yoga together.
Yoga is working to break all borders and unite people.
Thousands of enthusiasts from over 100 countries have made this occasion a big festival without caste, religion, region, color and men.
It is natural that people from all over the world have participated in Yoga Day programmes so enthusiastically.
It is a matter of pride that the country is proud that 250 crore people have practiced Yoga in our country's security guards and water-skies.
Some of the heroes performed Yoga in the inter-wave and some performed Yoga in the snowy mountains of Siachen.
Our warriors of the Air Force, in the middle of the sky, practiced Yoga at a height of 10,000 feet from the earth and established everyone.
They swim in the sky and did Yoga, but it's not on the plane.
Yoga was conducted in schools, colleges, offices, parks, high buildings and sports places.
Yoga has united people from all over the world across caste, religion and regions, and for centuries we have believed that Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.
Our sages, sages and other saints have shown the focus on any subject in the literature of Yoga.
More and more people will make it part of their lives.
My dear countrymen, many have written to me on MyGov and Narendra Modi App to tell you about the doctors Day coming to Mann Ki Baat this time on July 1.
It's okay.
Remember the doctor only when we get a problem.
However, it is a day that will be accomplished by the achievements of our doctors and it is an opportunity to thank them for their service and dedication to the society on this occasion.
The role of the doctor is not confined to the treatment of the disease.
Today, the doctor has medical expertise and has a great experience about how it affects our lifestyle and the common lifestyle.
With their talent and skills, Indian doctors have made their personality all over the world.
Heads of the medical sector are also known for hard work and resolving the problems related to diagnostic treatment.
Through Mann Ki Baat, I extend my best wishes to all our doctors and friends on the occasion of Dr.
Dear countrymen, we are fortunate to be born in this land of India.
India has a prosperous history without a month or day without any historical event.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
I'm coming to Magahar on 20th.
Do you know why he went to Magahar
There was a belief that those who died in Magahar had no heaven.
On the other hand, those who die in Kashi will have heaven.
Magahar was considered absurd but Saint Kabir didn't believe it.
In today's era, they are the same source of inspiration.
That is, the true spiritual saint knows and understands the pain of others.
The guy who doesn't know the pain of others is ruined.
At that time, there was an adversity and struggle in the world and he was a message of peace and harmony.
Together with the world mind, he worked to overcome the differences.
His words are true even after centuries.
Similarly, Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev is a guru.
He has shown guidance to millions of people and has been a source of inspiration for centuries.
He taught Guru Nanak Dev to eradicate caste differences in the society and see humanity as a whole and to change them.
Guru Nanak Dev used to say, 'Serving the poor and the poor is God's service.
In 2019, Guru Nanak Dev's 55th Prakash Parv will be celebrated.
I wish all of us to be partners with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
I urge all of you to think about how Guru Nanak Dev's 55th Prakash Parv is celebrated throughout the society and throughout the world about new ideas, new ideas, new ideas, new ideas and ideas, preparations and inspire us to celebrate the Prakash Parv with great importance.
There is a history related to Punjab.
The horrific event that was embarrassed by the entire humanity in Jallianwala Bagh has been a hundred years in 2019.
Dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar from Rohini in Delhi has written on the Narendra Modi Mobile App and Dr.
Shyamprasad is the birthday of Mukherjee.
In this programme, he has written to the people to tell me about Shyam Prasad Mukherjee.
Ramanji, for the first time, thank you very much.
Dr.
In 1937, after accepting the invitation of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the Convocation of Calcutta University in Bengali language.
It was for the first time that somebody in the Calcutta University was speaking in Bengali language at the Convocation during the British rule.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
In a way, he laid the foundation stone for India and industrial development and built a strong platform.
In India's first industrial policy announced in 1948, his ideas and visions have been marked.
He had a dream of achieving industrial self-reliance in all fields and to be skilled and prosperous.
He wanted SMEs to focus on handicrafts, textiles and hut industry.
All India Handicrafts Board, All India Handloom Board and Khadi-Village Industries Board were established between 1948 and 1950 to provide them financial assistance and institutional mechanism for proper development of housing and small scale industries.
Dr. Harsh Vardhan said that Indias defence manufacturing is also needed to be transformed.
The most important thing for Shyam Prasad Mukherjee was the integrity of India and for that he had to sacrifice his life at the age of only 50.
Come on.
People spoke of their imaginations, sadness and achievements.
In far-flung villages, girls are providing services from pension to passport to the elderly of the village through public service centres.
A sister from Chhattisgarh is doing ice cream manufacturing industry with seed fruit.
Like Ajan Prakash in Jharkhand, lakhs of youngsters of the country are providing medicines at affordable prices to nearby villages.
A young man from West Bengal was traveling for employment two-three years ago, and today a industry itself is successful.
Not only that, it gives ten to five.
School students from Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa are working on important issues such as waste processing in the school's tincture lab at their young age.
There are some in the society, they don't talk of disappointing things, they don't talk of failures, they don't try to convince them, they don't find peace without finding ways to unite.
In such an environment, when the common man comes with ideas and new enthusiasm and events in his life, it is not the government's best.
Even the events of a small child in such a small village can be inspired by 125 crore people.
With the help of technology, when I spent time with the beneficiaries through the video bridge, it was very comfortable and inspiring and there was an inspiration to do something.
There is a new joy and new enthusiasm to give life to the poor in the poor.
I'm very grateful to the people.
40-50 lakh people connected with this video bridge and gave me a new strength.
We can also feel the smell of goodness.
Last day, one thing came to my notice, it's a very different experience.
He worked successfully to increase the income of the farmers by formulating schemes related to farmers.
In a way, the farmers have a big role in the entire network from crop production to marketing, as well as ensuring double profits by ensuring the participation of the farmers, there is a need for good seeds to improve crops.
The seed bank has been built for that.
Women look at things in this seedbank, and women are also connected to it.
I knew something, I knew something, some knew it, some knew it, some knew it, but millions of people do some good things.
My dear countrymen, GST has been a year since then.
One Nation One Tax was the dream of people, and today it has been really transformed.
People from different political ideas are sitting there, people from different states, people from different priorities and states, but the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken unanimously.
Before the GST, there were several types of taxes in the country and according to this arrangement only one kind of taxes is in the country.
GST is the success of honesty and it is a festival of honesty.
Earlier, the complaint related to taxes in the country was raised by Inspector Raj.
IT, Information Technology and Information Technology have been replaced by the Inspector in GST.
Everything from return to refund is going on online through information technology.
GST was perhaps the largest tax reform programme in the world.
In India, such a huge tax reform has been initiated, it is because the people of the country have adopted and the success of GST has been ensured through Jan Shakti.
Generally, it was believed that such a big reform, such a huge population in such a large country would take 5-7 years to achieve complete success.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
Namaskar.
Navika Sagar Parikrama - Yes, I want to tell them something about them.
These six daughters of India, their group, have visited the world on the INSV land in the sea for more than two and a half days and returned to India on May 21.
The entire country warmly welcomed them.
Last Wednesday, I got the opportunity to see these daughters and listen to their travels.
Once again, I congratulate the world for enhancing the courage of those daughters and for enhancing the strength of the Navy and for enhancing the honour of India, especially the Indian daughters are not very bad.
Nobody has adventure.
If we pay attention to the development of humanity then we will see that progress has been made from the pregnancy of some courage.
Development is in the lap of adventure.
On May 16, 5 tribal children from a Ashram School in Maharashtra Chandrapur, Manisha Dhrute, Pramesh Ale, Umanta Madavi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Soyam reached the highest peak in the world.
The children of Ashram School have been trained in August 2017 at Vardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling, Leh and Ladakh.
These youngsters were selected under Machine Shaurya.
They took Everest as per the name and made the country proud.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all those associated with Chandrapur school and to these little kids.
The next time, the 16-year-old Shivangi Pathak was the youngest Indian girl from Nepal to Everest.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all those brave brave, especially the daughters.
It tags each other and challenges them.
Everyone is involved in this Fit India Movement.
Films, sports persons, ordinary people of the country, soldiers of the country and teachers of the school participated in it and listened to it all around.
If we fit, India and Fit...
Indian Cricket Team captain Virat Kohli has also challenged me and I have accepted his challenge and it is a good thing.
Such challenges will fit us and encourage others to be fit.
My dear countrymen, you have heard about sports, sportspersons and something I say in Mann Ki Baat several times.
Last time, the heroes of the Commonwealth Games spoke to us through this programme.
Chhavi Yadav ji, thank you for calling on the phone.
It is true that sports playing in every street of the past, which were part of the life of every child, are decreasing today.
These games were particularly part of the summer.
Sometimes in the afternoon, sometimes in the night and after the dinner, the children were playing for hours very slowly.
Outdoor and Indore.
The unity behind the diversity of our country can be seen in these sports.
The same game is known in different places by different names.
I'm from Gujarat.
A game in Gujarat is known as Chomal-Isto.
It plays with 8:8 square square square bords using dung or pimples.
This game was mostly played in all the states.
In Karnataka, it was called Chaukabara in Madhya Pradesh, Pachkali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Damam Game in Tamil Nadu or Tyam Game in Rajasthan.
But when you play, you understand that people in every country don't know the language, yes, yes.
We're gonna say we're playing this game.
Who will be those who don't play kids and kids in childhood.
Children and colony play in villages and towns.
Various names were called in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it was called Godibila or Karra Bila.
Orissa is called Gulibadi, which is called Vithidalu in Maharashtra.
Some games have their own climate, season.
It's like a season to fly.
When everybody blows up the sword, everybody plays, the different characteristics of ours are unforgettable.
The big ones look serious, but when they play, the child hidden in them comes out.
Traditional sports, along with physical ability, encourage our strategic thinking, concentration, awareness and spirit.
At the same time, we also know our culture and heritage.
Several sports make us aware of the society and the environment.
Calling people, we can create a great historical collection of our traditional sports.
This time theme is to defeat plastic waste - Beat Plastic Pollution.
I urge all of you not to use polythene and low quality plastics by understanding the spirit of this theme, and to reduce the impact of immunity on our health, on the nature of plastic waste and on wildlife.
The World Environment Day Wed-India 2018 website will see and know a lot of views given in a very attractive manner and try to implement them in a daily life.
When it's very hot, when the rain doesn't end, when it's terrible, everybody starts telling us like specialists like global warming, climate chaining.
But what's the matter with me
These are basically climate change, and the result is.
Our culture and tradition taught us not to fight with nature.
We have to live in harmony with nature, we have to live with nature.
Mahatma Gandhi argued for it all in life and in every step.
Today, India speaks of climate justice, India has played a key role in the Cop 21 Paris Treaty and we have united the world through the International Solar Alliance.
How to move forward in this matter
What can you do with a new one
It's rainy season.
There are reports that preparations are being made to celebrate International Day of Yoga all over the world on June 21.
The world has again understood the Yoga-Yoga for Unity for unity for the last few years.
By doing yoga, we always have the courage to wait like our father.
If all these qualities are friends then Yogi is successful in all kinds of fears.
I once again urge all the people to promote our heritage of Yoga and build a healthy, prosperous and well-being nation.
Dear countrymen, today is 27th May and the first Prime Minister of India is the memory of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
Prayer to Panditji...
The memory of this month is linked to another person.
In May 1957, Indians gave their strength to the British.
In 1857, Veerasavarkar wrote without fear that it was not luxury but the first fight for freedom.
Savarker's life was full of specialties.
Besides, he was a great poet and a social reformer and always gave importance to harmony and unity.
Our dearest description of Savarkarji has been made by our dear Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Savarkar carried poetry and revolution together.
He was a sensitive poet and a brave revolutionary.
If there is a zeal to do something then there is a determination to do it then it can be achieved between all the obstacles.
This is not just a matter of secrecy, but you can see it in every corner of India.
If you look around, you can see how people defeat resistances.
Even now, when we go to a tea shore, while enjoying the tea there, you must have noticed some neighbouring discussions and discussions.
These discussions can be politically connected, socially, films, sports and sportspersons, the problems of the country.
You will be surprised to know that he is the light of education in the lives of more than 70 children.
He opened a school called ASHASHAN for children living in the streets and streets, so that the poor teakers spend 50 of their income.
He arranges for education, health and food for all children coming to school.
I'm D.
I congratulate Prakash Rao for his hard work, dedication and a new direction to the lives of the poor children.
He's abandoned the darkness of his life.
There will be a lot of things like this in your neighborhood.
There will be countless events.
Come on, let's encourage good.
The moon is waiting for a few days.
Everyone feels that Eid will be celebrated with great enthusiasm, especially the children will get good gifts.
Id hopes that we will strengthen harmony and friendship in our society.
My best wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thanks to all of you.
And the next month's Manki Battle can be together.
Mann Ki Baat, Telephone 2018
The Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th to 15th April.
71 countries including India participated in this event.
In such a big event, thousands of sportspersons from all over the world will imagine what happens to be the environment there.
Who can be left out in an atmosphere with enthusiasm, zeal, ideas, hopes and determination to achieve success.
India has shown a record improvement in shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, table tennis and badmintons.
India won 66 medals with 26 gold, 20 silver and 20 bronze.
This success will be proud of all Indians.
Everything's drowned in the same emotion.
Words will be sorry to express that emotion.
But I'd like to hear you from the players.
It was my dream to be a sportsperson of India and Manipur.
Do you know that all the restaurants who went to India this time have won medals
Manika Batra won medals in all her participants.
She is the first Indian woman to win the Gold for India in Personal Table Tenny.
India has got the highest medal shooting.
The 15-year-old shooter Anish Bhanwala is the youngest sportsperson to win Gold for India at the Commonwealth Games.
Sachin Chaudhary is the only Para Power Lifter in the Commonwealth Games medal for India.
This time, the medal winners are more women.
Whether it is squash or boxing, white lifting or shooting, women were surprised.
The last fight in the Badminton was two Indian sportspersons Saina Nehru and P.
Sindhu was in the middle.
Everyone was eager to get two medals in India even though it was a competition.
The sportspersons participated in the games went from different parts of the country to small towns.
They have the role of their strong friends in every situation.
Last month, in Mann Ki Baat, I had called upon the people, especially the youth to fit India.
Come along with Fit India, I urge you to lead Fit India.
I am very happy that people join it with great enthusiasm.
Shashikanth Bhosle has written his own picture in the swimming pond, My Weapon Is My Body, My Almont Is Water, My World Is Swimming...
For me, travel and trekking are Fit India.
I am very happy to see the well-known people inspire our youth to fit India in a very attractive way.
A video has been shared in Akshay Kumar Kalakaran.
You must see all of you, in which he was exercising with Wooden Beed.
He says that this exercise is very good for the muscles of the stomach and outside.
There's another video in the process.
He's playing Volleyball with people.
Many youngsters have shared their experiences related to Fit India efforts.
I think such initiatives are very beneficial for all of us and for the entire country.
One more thing is to say that Yoga is the name of the Incredible Fit India Movement.
Yoga has a special significance in the Fit India programme and you must have started preparations.
The significance of International Day of Yoga on 21st June has now been accepted by the entire world.
You're ready now.
Not only alone, your city, your village, your colony, your school, your school, your school, everybody, everybody, every old man, every woman, everybody should try to connect with Yoga.
Today, it is not necessary to say in India or in the world that how Yoga is beneficial for the complete development of the body, mental development and mental balance.
You've seen my animated video is very popular.
They've shown a very minute teacher through animation.
You'll get the benefit of that.
I'd like to tell you something by inviting you for a new job.
Many youngsters spend their time to learn something new recently.
Otherwise, internship provides a new experience in its own way.
Outside the four walls, it is an opportunity to experience life in a new way by escaping from papers, pens and computers.
My young friends, I invite you to a special internship.
The three Ministries of the Government of India, the Ministry of Sports, Human Resource Development and the Ministry of Drinking Water Resources, have started a Swachh Bharat Summer Internship 2018 together.
If students of the college, NCC youth, NSS and Nehru Youth Centre volunteers want to do something for the country, if they want to learn something for the society and the country, if they want to join the change of the society and if they want to become a causer then it is an opportunity for those who want to do something seriously in the society with a positive energy.
This will provide support and strength to cleanliness and it will be a pleasure to do something before the celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October.
The awards will be given at the national level to the best members who participated in this event, those who have done good work in the college and those who have done good work in the university.
Not only this, the UGC will give two credit letters to those who are very well-finished.
Once again, students, students and youth are inviting them to internship and take advantage of this.
You can go to MyGov and register Swachh Bharat Summer Internship.
I hope our youth will come forward in this campaign for cleanliness.
I'd like to know about your efforts.
Tell me what you know, know about the events, send pictures, send video.
Use this holiday for a new experience.
We urge people to see them all and we can see how many people do good things and how good things are going on in every corner of our country.
Last day I saw the story of the youngsters who have been selfless for the education of the poor children.
Together with these youth, a big programme has been started for the education of the street children and children living in the habitations of Delhi.
They stopped the condition of children who were starving on the roads or doing small jobs, so that they came down for this dynamic activity.
Youth and teachers associated with this programme have been making a great effort for social transformation by changing their busy life for two hours.
Brothers and sisters, Similarly, some farmers from the mountainous region of Uttarakhand have been inspired by the farmers across the country.
They have not only changed the fate of the region by their unanimous efforts.
Ragi, Chaulai, gram or barley are mainly cultivated in Bageshwar in Uttarakhand.
Due to being a mountainous area, the farmers did not get the price worth it.
This biscuit in the presence of iron is very beneficial for pregnant women.
These farmers have formed a cooperative group in Munar village and started a bisket-building factory.
After seeing the courage of the farmers, the administration linked it to the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit is now reaching not only in Bageshwar district but also in about 50 Anganwadi centres, Almora and Kaisani.
The annual turnover of the group has not only reached Rs. 10-15 lakhs by the efforts of the farmers but also by providing employment to more than 900 households, it has reduced the population from the district to the outskirts.
Do you think water conservation should be a social responsibility
I'd like to think about how to protect every rain.
We know that water conservation is not a new issue in the minds of Indians.
The subject of the book is not the subject of language.
Our ancestors have lived this for centuries.
They gave priority to the importance of each drop of water.
They searched for new solutions to keep every drop of water safe.
There are huge inscriptions in Manar Kovil, Chiranmahadevi, Kovilpatti and Navakottai and many ponds are like tourist destinations today.
However, do not forget that these huge collections of water are the living examples of our ancestors' efforts.
The UNESCO World Heritage Centre, known as Rani Ki Bawadi in Adalaj and Patan in Gujarat, is worth seeing.
These ponds are in a way water temples.
If you go to Rajasthan, you must go to Chandbawadi in Jodhpur.
This is the largest and most beautiful Bawadi in India, which is in the water-free region.
It is a good time to store rain water during April, May, June and July and we will be benefitted according to what we are preparing before.
In the last three years, everyone has done something in their own way in water conservation and water management.
In 2017-18, 55 of total expenditure of Rs. 64,000 crore has been spent on water conservation, i. e.
Over the last three years, such water conservation and water management have resulted in more than 150 lakh hectares of land.

Today, it is the world's most needed human value.
Buddha's inspiration is immense in the social philosophy of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.

I convey my best wishes to all those who believe in Lord Buddha and the principles of Karuna all over the world.

But I was most influenced by Meghalaya and the farmers there.
This state, which is very slightly detailed, has seen a great deal of work.
Our farmers in Meghalaya have produced records in 2015-16 as compared to five years before that.

Today, all the departments and Ministries are working together for a healthy India, whether it is Ministry of Swachhta or Ministry of AYUSH or Ministry of Women and Child Development or State Governments, for affordable healthcare along with defence routes.
Disease resistance is the cheapest and easy healthcare.
As much as we are aware of disease resistance, it will benefit the individual, the family and the society.

We must ensure that this time we will do Yoga ourselves and inspire the entire family, friends and everyone to do Yoga.
You must inspire children, youth and elderly citizens in new attractive ways to do yoga.
There are several programmes related to Yoga throughout the year on TV and electronic media.
Can you create a awareness about Yoga as an initiative from now on Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga.
I'll share the video with you so that we can learn asanas and pranayama together.

Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
Years ago, Dr.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of making India an industrialisation.
For him, the industry was a good medium of providing employment to the poorest of the poor.
Today, when we successfully take the Make in India initiative in the country, Dr.
With his vision, the Smart City Mission and Urban City Mission have been launched in the country today, it should be possible to provide good roads or water facilities or education or digital connectivity to big cities and small towns of the country.
Baba Saheb had great faith in self-reliance and self-reliance.
He wanted no person to be in poverty forever.
At the same time, he was convinced that his poverty cannot be eradicated only because he gave something to the poor.
Today, initiatives like Mudra Yojana, Startup India and Standup India are giving birth to our youngsters.
He emphasized the importance of water consumption for the development of the country, various River Valley Authorities, various commissions related to water, all are born in the vision of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Today, efforts are being made to reduce history for waterways and ports in the country.
He emphasized the importance of working together between the Centre and the States for the development of the country in the federalism and federal system.
He showed us that it is not necessary to be born in a large or prosperous family in higher heights, but those born in poor families in India can see dreams and try to realise those dreams and achieve success.
Baba Saheb was playing Ambedkar.
Accordingly, there will be special programmes across India on issues such as Rural Development, Poverty Welfare and Social Justice.
I urge all of you to participate in these programmes with enthusiasm.

My young friends have asked me a lot of questions related to science, and they write something.
We see the colour of the ocean blue, but we understand from our experience that there is no colour of water.
Have we ever thought why the water of the river or the sea looks colorful
The same question came to the mind of a young man in 1920s.
This is the question that a scientist was born in modern India.
Now, when we talk about science, the first thing is Bharat Ratna C.
One of his findings is famous as Raman Effect.
It is said that this is the same day that he found the truth of light skating and that's why he received the Nobel Prize.
This country has given birth to many great scientists in the field of science.
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandrabose and Hargovind Khurana and Satyendranath Bose are proud of India.
The famous 'Boson' party has been named after Satyendranath Bose.
Next time, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai and inaugurated the Wadhwani Institute of Artificial Intelligence.
It was very pleasant to know about the miracles in the field of science.
Artificial Intelligence helps in manufacturing robots, boots and other specified objectives.
Now the machines are making their own mind more smart through self-laning.
This technology can be used to improve the lives of the poor and the poor.
I asked the scientific community how artificial intelligence can help in ease of living of disabled brothers and sisters in the programme on Artificial Intelligence.
Would we be better aware of natural hazards through artificial intelligence
Can farmers help in the field of agricultural production
Does Artificial Intelligence provide access to healthcare to everybody facilitate ease and treat diseases in modern ways
Last day, with the Prime Minister of Israel, ICRET was given an opportunity to participate in the inauguration of the programme in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There a young man said about developing a digital device.
I think a lot of such things can be used for artificial intelligence.
Scientific technologies are one that can be called Value Neutral.
Any machine will do what we want.
But what we want to do with the machine depends on us.
Thomas Alva Edison, who discovered the lighting bulb, failed several times in his test.

Fortunately, I am in Aravalli, the workplace of Maharshi Aravind today.
As a revolutionary, he challenged the British regime, fought against them and raised many questions to British India.
The idea of repeating questions is important to know the truth.
This is the real inspiration behind scientific inventions.
Why, don't be quiet until the questions are answered.
On this occasion of National Science Day, I convey my best wishes to scientists and others associated with science.
Friends, I get a lot of messages on all issues such as security and extremism during the times of trouble, people write something related to it to me.
From Pune, Shri Rabindra Singh and Shri Narendra Modi have commissioned the mobile app on the safety of jobs.
He wrote that the security norms do not exist in our country, where the factories and construction works are underway.
Next March 4 is the National Security Day of India, he added that the Prime Minister should also talk about security in the Mann Ki Baat programme to make people aware about security.
When we talk about public safety, two things are very important, initiatives and preparations.
One is needed at the time of accident - Safety During Disaster - the other is necessary in daily life - Safety in Everriday Life .
If we are not aware of security in everyday life, if there is no such awareness then it is difficult to happen when there is a danger.
We must have written on the boards on the way: If there is no awareness, the accident will certainly lose a wrong loss, happiness and laughter and ensure security without leaving the world so soon.
I would like to tell you that the Fire Brigades in the cities of Fire Brigade should go to schools once a week or once a month and showcase in front of the children.
So, there will be two benefits, the Fire Brigade will have a careful habit, and the new generation can know about it.
Talking about the dangers, India is a geographical and climate-rich country.
This country has witnessed several disasters like natural calamities, chemicals and industrial accidents.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is at the forefront of facing dangers in the country.
The NDMA will soon arrive in various accidents such as earthquake, floods, cyclone and landslides.
Twenty-three years ago, the heatwave was due to thousands of people lost their lives every year.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to hot winds has declined to almost 220.
If we prioritize security, we can achieve security.
There are innumerable people in the society, there are social organisations, there are aware citizens and I congratulate all those who have reached the rescuers in the last minute.
The number of such unnamed heroes is not less.
Our Fire and Rescue Services, National Disaster Response Forces, Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces etc. reach the dangers and help the brave people without losing their lives.
We have to make a society aware of the accident.
We look forward to values in our culture, we often talk about security values, but we also have to understand the values of security.
We have to turn it into a part of our life.
In our ordinary life, we have travelled hundreds of times in a plane, and in the air hostess in the air, we see warnings about safety at the beginning.
We've heard it a hundred times, but if someone asks us where every thing is, where's the life jacket
That's why our ears on the plane have a habit of hearing, but we don't think these warnings are with me too.
This is what happens in every field of life.
We shouldn't think security is for anyone else.
If all of us are aware of our security, then the spirit of security of the society will also be included in it.
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, with the objective of Swachh Bharat, the villages had given importance to the topic of 'West to Wealth' and 'West to Energy'.
The objective of the Gobar Dhan Yojana is to clean villages, replace livestock and ruins of agriculture, composta and biogyas through which wealth and energy are produced.
The number of four times in India is the highest in the world, where approximately 300 million fodder and their silver production is about 3 million tonnes per day.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen, this thing is also being progressed.
The Gobardhan Yojana will benefit the rural areas and will help in keeping the village clean.
I invite you to participate in this mass movement called Clean Energy and Green Job and move forward to convert the waste into a wealth of your village and to convert salt into silver.
My dear countrymen, we have so far heard about many festivals like Festival, Food Festival, Film Festival.
However, as a unique initiative in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the state's first luxury festival was held.
The objective of the festival organised in Raipur was to create awareness about cleanliness and to create awareness about the unique methods of utilising the waste of the city actively and reuse of salt.
During this festival, various programmes were held and the absorbed people participated in it.
Several festivals were organized in other districts with inspiration from the programme in Raipur.
Everyone has done their own way and shared new ideas on Swachhta, discussions and poems.
The importance of waste processing and cleanliness was presented in a new way in this festival, which congratulates the people of Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the government and the rulers of Chhattisgarh.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on March 8.
Several programmes are organised in our country and around the world.
On this day, the Nari Shakti Puraskar is conferred on those who have done comprehensive work in various fields.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development beyond women's development.
On this occasion, I remember Swami Vivekananda's words.
He said that the idea of full womenhood is a complete freedom and this idea of Swamiji's 25 years ago reflects the concept of women's power in Indian culture.
Today, it is our duty to ensure equal participation of women in all fields of social and economic life, which is our responsibility.
We are part of the tradition that is recognized by men and women, the children were known as Yashoda-Nandan, Kausalya-Nandan and Gandhari-Puthan.
Today, our women's strength shows soul and self-confidence through their actions.
They progressed themselves and took the country and the society forward and brought it to a new goal.
Our vision of New India is an equal partner in the overall development of the country, ultimately women-powered, powerful and holistic.
A lot of examples can be taken forward for what women power can do and if you look at the environment then you can see such stories inspiring life.
I got to know something from Jharkhand.
Under the Swachh Bharat Yojana, 15 lakh women in Jharkhand should remember that this number is not very low - 15 lakh women have organized a Swachh Bharat Mission for a month.
These women in Jharkhand have shown that the Swachhta movement in ordinary life can transform the Swachhta culture into the nature of the common man.
Brothers and sisters, two days ago, in three villages of Elephanta Islands, we saw in the news that 70 years after independence, the people of Elephanta Islands were enjoyed.
You know that Elephanta Island is in the sea 10 km away from Mumbai.
This is a very attractive centre for tourism.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that the villages and caves of Elephanta will see the light of electricity.
This is not only electrification but also a new beginning of development.
May a light in the lives of the people, pleasure in life... and a moment more joyful and enthusiastic than this.
Dear countrymen, we celebrated the night of Shiva on the last day.
Now the month of March is the time to call crop-rich farming, wheat, gold and other crops, sowing mangoes. This is the specialty of this month.
This month is a month of love for everyone because of Holi celebration.
On March 2, everyone will celebrate Holi with joy.
Friends, Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat 2018
For the first time in history, the rulers of 10 countries participated in this festival.
He commemorated the commemoration of the Kalpana Chaula, which has carried out space travel, on February 1.
Despite the accident in the Colombia Space Port, Kalpan has inspired millions of youngsters across the world.
We lose Kalpana Chaula at such a young age, which is a matter of sadness for all of us.
It is a matter of great pleasure to see that these women are moving fast in every field and enhancing the pride of the country.
In ancient times, the respect that women have received in our country, their place in the society and their contributions are surprising all over the world.
There is a long tradition of Indian scholars.
Now tell me about Bei Bachao, Bei Padhao.
In ancient times, Rachikpe says in Skandapurana - Dasputra, Samanya, Dasputra Kadhyan, which is the result, Martya, which is available, Kanyakaya.
I mean, a daughter is equal to ten sons, and you will get honour in a daughter.
This shows the importance of women in our society.
That is why women have been given the status of strength in our society.
This lady power binds the entire country, the entire society and the entire family on the lines of unity.
Whether it is the panditya of the scholars of the Vedic times of Lopamudra, Gargi, Mitrai, the knowledge and devotion of Akamahadevi and Meerabai, the ruler of Ahlyabai Holkar or the courage of Rani Lakshmibai, the women's power inspires us.
Increase the dignity of the country, Shri Narendra Modi said.

Make a book on these women I have taken, so that everyone in the country should know about the strength of this woman and inspire you and their work in their lives.
This is available for e-books in the Narendra Modi web site.
Women's power plays an important role in the positive changes in the country and the society.
When we talk about women empowerment, I would like to tell you about a railway station.
You might have thought of the relationship between railway stations and women empowerment.
The Maunga station in Mumbai is the first station in India for all the workers.
Empowerment is a form of self-sufficiency.
The Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh is a Maowad-affected area.
The Maoists have built a horrific atmosphere full of violence, attacks, bombs, guns and pistols.
In such a terrible area, tribal women are getting themselves sufficient by running e-Oriksha.
In a short span of time, many women have been associated with this.
With this, it will also strengthen the environmental conservation.
The district administration has played an important role in the success of these women, from providing Grands to Training.
For centuries, there will be constant efforts in our society individual and social ways for social evils and evils.
Just a few days ago, this kind of beginning took place in Bihar.

Through this drive, he awakened the social witness against the evils of child marriage and women's system.
The state has resolved to fight against evils such as women and child marriage.
All youngsters, mothers and sisters, full of enthusiasm and zeal, have become participants in this festival.

The objective of the scheme is to enhance healthcare as well as enhance livelihood.
The trees sold at Jan Aushadhi Kendras are 50 to 90 lower than branded trees.

I am glad that people living in different countries and people from roots in India serve those countries as well as maintain their strong relations with India and this time the European Union has sent me a calendar.
Our Indian diaspora lives in different countries of Europe, some work with cyber security, some are dedicated to Ayurveda, some of them through their music, some poems embrace the minds of the society.
January 30 is the memorial day of the revered father of our new path.
We serve as a martyr's day and we pay homage to the great martyrs who have sacrificed their lives for the defence.
They're not just theories.
My dear countrymen, I conclude my words by conveying my best wishes to all of you for 2018.
Mann Ki Baat, 2017
This is the last day of Mann Ki Baat this year, which is the last day of 2017.
This year I shared a lot of things with you.
Years will change after a few hours, but the sharing of these ideas will continue.
On the occasion of Christmas, we all remember the great lessons of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ gave great importance to the spirit of service.
We see the essence of service in the Bible.
Gurudev Ramkrishna Paramhansar used to say, "Life with Shiva".
An extraordinary life filled with the courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh ji is an inspiration for all of us.
In this endeavour, he had to lose a lot personally.
In the beginning of this year, it was a very lucky opportunity for me to participate in the Prakash Festival organized in Patna Saheb on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
We will decide with our heart to learn lessons from the great lessons and inspirational life of Guru Gobind Singh.
January 1, 2018, i.e. tomorrow...
Tomorrow is a special day for me.
But when I say that it is special, I repeat that it's really special.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters and the voters of New India in the 21st century.
All this India is encouraging to welcome you as voters of the twenty-fourth century.
You will be proud to be a voter of the 21st century.
Your vote will be based on New India.
The strength of the vote is the greatest strength in democracy.
Voting is the most capable of bringing about a positive change in the lives of millions of people.
You don't just have the right to vote.
You can also be the creators of the twenty-fourth century by thinking about how India should be in the twenty-fourth century and what your dream should be about India in the twenty-fourth century.
Youth in New India is a matter of enthusiasm, innovation and energy.
The dream of New India is fulfilled by our energetic, skilled and powerful youth.
When we talk about New India, it says of a free India from casteism, casteism, terrorism and the poison of corruption.
India free from waste and poverty.
Everyone gets equal opportunity, the New India that is fulfilling the aspirations of everyone.
New India is the strength of peace, unity and harmony that leads us.
My youngsters should come forward and analyze how a New India will be formed.
How can we realise our concepts before 2022
How can we build a India that our freedom fighters dreamt of
Mahatma Gandhi had transformed the freedom struggle into a mass movement.
My young friends, we have to organise a mass movement to create a magnificent and divine India of the 21st century.
The creation of development, the creation of progress, the mass movement for a skilled and powerful India.
Today, many opportunities have been opened for the youth.
From skill development to innovation and entrepreneurship, our youth are moving forward and winning.
I would like to imagine how the youth of this New India can get information about the schemes that open up such opportunities and as soon as 18 years of age, they will be able to know about this world and these schemes and create a system that will benefit.
There is nothing impossible for a person full of positive thinking and enthusiasm.
There's an article in English, Pesimism Leads to Weekness, Optimism to Power.
The statements and reactions that came were really encouraging.
It was a pleasant experience.
Some of them shared a positive impact on their minds.
Some shared their personal achievements.
My name is Fish Bhatia.
I live in Myur Vihar, Pocket 1, Phase 1, Delhi.
My daughter M.
B.
My name is Jyoti Rajendra Wade.
I'm talking from a place called Bodel.
According to my husband's suggestions, the amount of insurance was received for one rupee per month.
He died in an accident.
Then we know what our situation is.
My name is Anand Jadhav.
Our distinct villages are going through the National Highway since 2017.
My name is Satish Bewani.
There was a shortage of water in our area and for the last 40 years we have been dependent on the pipeline of the soldiers.
Now put a special pipeline.
It was our biggest achievement in 2017.
There are many people who do such things at their own level to bring about positive changes in the lives of people.
In fact, this is the new India that we are building together.
Next time, I got to know about the stories inspired by Pasaya Amju and Bashir Khan Khatak in front of the Administrative Service from Kashmir.
He was at the forefront of the Kashmir Administrative Service Examination to be freed from the toxic destruction of terrorism and hatred.
You will be surprised to know that in 1990 terrorists had burnt his legacy house.
His family had to leave the land of their heritage as much as terrorism and violence were there.
He chose a different way for himself and served people.
Saving from the opposite environment, he created the story of success.
Today, he is inspiring not only the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also the entire country.
Anjo has also proved that the environment is so bad, but with a positive step, it has proved that it will liberate the carpets of disappointment.
Last week I had the opportunity to meet some girls in Jammu and Kashmir.
There was enthusiasm, enthusiasm, energy, dream and determination.
As long as I spent with those children, I got inspiration from time to time.
This is the strength of the country, these are my youth, these are the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is natural to talk about the sabarimala temple of Kerala when not only of my country but also of the world's famous religious places.
In this world famous temple, millions of devotees come every year to get the blessings of Lord Ayyapaswamy.
How big a challenge can it be to keep so many devotees coming to such an important place without waste
If there are mountains and jungles then do you have to say specially
A police officer named Vijayan, started a programme called Punya Punnan, and a self-confidence of awareness has been started in terms of waste generation.
Any devotee has come and made a habit that the journey will not be completed without doing any physical work in the matter of cleanliness.
There's no bigger in this campaign, no smaller.
Every devotee believes that it is part of the worship of God and keeps away for some time for cleanliness, works and works to remove waste.
Every morning the vision of cleaning the waste here is very surprised and all the pilgrims participate in it.
Whether it is a big celebrities or a bigger economy or a big officer, everybody is a part of the programme of Punya Pujan like ordinary devotees, we are moving forward after cleaning.
There are many examples before us.
In such a sanitation mount in Sabarimala, Punya Puja is a part of the pilgrimage of all the devotees.
There, with a strong dragon, the vision of sanitation is progressing together.
My dear countrymen, on 2nd October 2014, we took a pledge to complete the incomplete mission of Bapuji, the revered Bapu Ji, Swachh Bharat and Swachh Mukt Bharat.
Bapuji had worked for this thing all his life.
In rural areas and urban areas, there has been a widespread change in the cooperation of the people.
The Worlds largest Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be conducted between January 4 and March 10, 2018 to assess the achievements made on the quality of sanitation in urban areas.
This survey will be conducted between 40 crore people in more than 4,000 cities.
They'll talk to the citizens and know their response.
Analysis of the use of Swachhta App and upgradation of various services centres will be done.
It will be tested whether cleanliness in the city has been made in the city to become the habit of the people and to make the city a habit of the people.
Don't let the government do cleanliness.
All citizens and citizen organisations have a great responsibility.
I urge all the people to participate in the Swachhta Survey in the coming days.
Try not to be behind your city, your streets and villages.
On the basis of this survey, cities will be ranked - if your city is more than one lakh people, in the rankings of the country, if there is less than one lakh population then it should be your dream to get the highest position in the local rankings.
Come, with this commitment, once again reminding Bapu Ji, we can use the best initiatives with the vision of Swachh Bharat.
My dear countrymen, some things may seem very small but as a society, there is a far-reaching impact on our personality.
Today, I would like to share such a thing with you in this programme of Mann Ki Baat.
For decades, Muslim women were injustice, but no one had even talked about it.
There are no such laws in many Islamic countries.
But Muslim women in India had no right to go to Haj without men.
I have suggested to the Minority Affairs Ministry to ensure that all women applying to go alone will be allowed to go to Hajj.
Generally, the elections are being held by hate for the Haj pilgrimage and I would like to give them an opportunity to abstain from this hatred and to give them an opportunity to go alone.
The development journey of India has moved on the basis of their talent on the strength of our women's strength.
I am confident that our women and men should have equal rights and equal opportunities and we should continue to work together on the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, January 26 is a historic celebration for us.
However, 26th January, 2018 will be remembered specially.
Leaders from 10 ASEAN countries will come to India to attend the Republic Day celebrations this year.
On Republic Day, it's not one time, it's ten chief guests.
This has never happened in the history of India.
2017 was special for ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN completed 50 years and completed 25 years of Indias collaboration with ASEAN in 2017.
It is a matter of great pride for all of us to join these great leaders from 10 countries of the world on January 26.
Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals and in a way our country is the country of festivals.
It doesn't happen even a day that hasn't been associated with the festival.
We've celebrated Christmas now, the New Year is going to be here.
May the coming New Year bring you happiness, happiness and prosperity.
We can move forward with new innovation, new zeal, happiness and new commitment.
The month of January is the time when the sun moves to Uttarayan, the Makar Sankranti is celebrated this month.
This is a festival related to nature.
All the festivals like Sankranta in Rajasthan, Magha-Bihu in Assam and Pollution in Tamil Nadu are special in their own way and they have their own importance.
All these festivals are celebrated between January 13 and January 17.
All the names of these festivals are different but the basic elements are the same.
Once again, many best wishes for the New Year 2018.
Thank you very much, dear people.
Mann Ki Batt, September 2019
At the age, they are very older than us, they are witnesses to each step in the country and every period of time.
Before leaving for a foreign trip, I got the opportunity to talk to Didi on the phone.
It was a lovely conversation with Anujan Chechi.
I don't usually talk about personal conversations like this.
Modi ji- Ladadi ji, Prama.
I'm talking to Narendra Modi.
My best wishes to Modi ji and Didi on his birth anniversary.
May the health of Didi be good, let us all see the blessings of Didi.
Before going to America, he was calling for a call to Didi.
I was very happy to hear that Lataji-Modiji's phone will come.
Will you go back to me
Everyone at home...
Lataji, I think of the blessings of my parents and the blessings of the listeners.
You don't know what you are.
I know the film of India is changing as soon as you come.
Modi ji yes.
My mother was very happy with this affection of Modi ji and Didi.
I am very grateful to Modi ji-Didi always remembering me.
Once again, I extend my best wishes on the birthday.
Modi ji, when he came to Mumbai this time, it was good to see him.
Modi ji, but I'll be late.
Modi Ji should come home and eat some Gujarati food from Didi's hand.
Lataji, of course.
I'm lucky to think of it.
Modi ji - Pramanam Didi.
Lata ji Prama.
My best wishes to Modi Ji and Didi, Lataji-Namaste Namaste.
Modi ji-Namaste.
My dear countrymen, from today onwards, the time of celebrations has come up with new enthusiasm, new energy, new zeal and new determinations.
Now for weeks, there will be a glimpse of festivals throughout the country.
Everyone from the family will join the festivals.
It's called the darkness in the bottom of the call.
Perhaps, this scripture is not just a word, but an order for all of us, a vision, an inspiration.
On the one hand, a lot of houses are lighted, on the other hand, look at the darkness in some of the nearby lanes in front of them.
When this darkness is over, it is a little lighting, it is a real pleasure for these festivals.
They search for people from their homes, collecting clothes, sweets and foods and sending them.
This time, in this season of festivals, can you try to darken the bottom of the light with a dryness and determination
The sniffing of the face of many poor families will double your joy in the festivals, your face will be more bright, your light will be more bright, your Diwali will be more bright.
Can we welcome Laxmi this time in a new way
In our culture, daughters are considered Lakshmi because daughters bring fortune and prosperity.
There will be many daughters in our midst with their hard work, dedication, intellectuality, family, society and nation.
Can you organise a programme to honour these Laxmis in India on the occasion of Diwali
There will be many daughters and daughters who do extraordinary things near us.
Our society should recognize such daughters, respect them, pride in their name.
Together, we can inspire all of us as the great mass movement of 'Selfie with Daughter' has spread all over the world.
Similarly, this time we will be organising a public meeting of Bharat Ki Laxmi.
Promoting Laxmi of India is to strengthen the path of prosperity of the country and the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, I have already said that through the Mann Ki Baat programme, I have got the opportunity to interact directly and indirectly with many people who do not know and know.
A student from Arunachal, how far away the last day, Alina Thyang wrote a very interesting letter to me.
My country is Roying in Arunachal Pradesh.
This time when my exam results came, people asked me if I had read the book Exam Warriors.
After that, my experience was very good.
If I had read that book before the exam, I thought it was very good.
In addition, this little friend has given me a job.
But I have an appeal to you to help me.
I'm sure I did it.
I'll definitely try to write things in my words, in my own way.
Once again I express my gratitude to this little friend of Arunachal Pradesh and student Alina Tayang.
Look.
This time, as we discussed the success in the Open, the speech of the Honble Honble Daniel Medvedaw was also discussed and there was a good propaganda in social affairs.
I've also spoken and played the game.
In the 23-year-old Dan, Madwedev's luxury and his talent attracted everyone.
Of course it attracted me too.
Shortly before this speech, he defeated Grand Salam Jetha for 19 times and Rafael Nathal, historian of Tennis.
If someone else was on this occasion, he would have become sad and disappointed.
His words were welcomed by the audience with joy.
He also appreciated the Champion Nadal in Dan and how Nadal inspired millions of youngsters to play tennis and how difficult it was to play with him.
The zeal of a person who failed in the same game and the humility of victory was worth seeing.
If you don't listen to the words of Medveda in Dan, you must see all of you, especially to the youth.
In this, people from all sections and age groups have a lot to learn and have a great moment over the kingdoms of victory.
The kingdoms aren't big.
Life must be a success.
It has been said in our country's sciences in a very beautiful way.
The thoughts of our ancestors are surely greetings.
In the scriptures, it has been said: Vidya Vinaya Upatha Haritna Chetansi Kasya Manujasyamani Kanjana combination is the world-class devotion that if a person unites qualification and wisdom then his mind cannot be successful.
In fact, this young sportsperson has conquered the minds of people all over the world.
My dear countrymen, especially young friends, I'm going to tell you again for your good.
Debates will take place, but there will be a lot of consequences to prevent some things from growing before it grows.
When it grows very big, it's very difficult to stop some things after it grows very wide.
But in the beginning, if we stop it very carefully then many can be protected.
It is because of the nicotine in which the intoxication of tobacco is incurable .
Its consumption in childhood affects the growth of the brain.
But today I want to tell you about a new subject.
You may be aware that e-cigarettes have been banned in India recently.
Different e-cigarettes from ordinary cigarettes are an electronic device in a way.
A kind of chemical smoke forms when nicotein substance is hot in e-cigarette.
Like other cigarettes, it mixs aromatic chemicals to prevent foul smell from it.
He's trying to stop others from smoking smokers at home even if his father is a chean smoker, I wish that children don't have a habit of smoking cigarettes and beedies.
He wants not to smoke cigarettes at home.
He knows that the body is suffering from smoking and tobacco.
But the matter of e-cigarette is quite different.
People don't know so much about e-cigarette.
It's very unaware of the accident, so sometimes e-cigarette gets access to the house as it's just finished.
You know if someone smokes near us, we can know it with a smell.
Even though cigarette packs in his pocket, it can be known by the smell.
But this is not the case of e-cigarette, so many children and youngsters are pridefully seen walking in their books, offices, pockets, sometimes roaming around their hands and becoming victims of them.
The younger generation is the future of the country.
This new way of intoxication is prohibited by e-cigarette in the country to not destroy our youth, to prevent the dreams of the families, to not destroy the lives of the children, to prevent this disease from spreading the roots in the society.
I urge everyone to leave the habit of tobacco and not misconception of e-cigarettes.
You remember Fit India, huh
Fit India is not meant to go to the gym for two hours in the morning and evening.
Fit India has to stand away from it.
Our Bharatamba, our country is a multi-dimensional Vasundhra.
Several humanitarians are roaming on this planet.
India was the birthplace of abnormal people like that, the land of work.
They are dedicated themselves to others except for themselves.
Such a great personality is being honoured in Vatican City on October 13.
This is a matter of pride for all Indians and Pope France will announce Maryam Thresia as holy on 13th October.
Sister Maryam Thresia, the work done for the betterment of mankind in their narrow lifestyle of 50 years, is an example all over the world.
My dear countrymen, India is proud not only of the fact that while we celebrate Gandhi 150, 130 crore people have taken a pledge to get rid of the single use plastic.
India is looking forward to the world in terms of environmental conservation, so the entire world's eyes are now visible to India.
I am sure you will be part of the public meeting to avoid unemployment plastic on 2nd October.
People play their role in each other in their own way.
But a young man in our country is doing a very different movement.
When I turned my attention towards his work, I made a phone call to him and tried to know and understand his new way.
He said that it can be beneficial for the country and the people.
Mr.
When I heard the word Plogging first, I had a new word.
Perhaps this word can be used abroad.
However, in India, Riputaman Dalvi has made a big propaganda.
Come on, let's talk to him.
130 crore people will take one step in this regard and once used, our India will take up 130 crore steps in the field of elimination of Unified Plastic.
Riputman ji, once again thank you very much.
My best wishes to you and your team and this new resolution.
I'd like to remember one thing before.
However, it was time for some people to start training and plan some programmes.
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 15th August I told you from the Red Fort to travel to 15 places in India by 2022.
Please plan to stay at least one night or two nights at least 15 places.
You see India, understand, feel.
My dear countrymen, once again my best wishes to you all for the various festivals of India with diverse diversity.
Yeah.
On the occasion of Deepawali, it should be kept in mind that people do not have any danger or fire.
We need precautions too.
Together with enthusiasm, we can celebrate festivals with new dreams and new resolves.
Once again, my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
Namaskar to my dear countrymen.
Just a short while ago, I got the opportunity to interact indirectly with children from Karnataka.
They urged the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country in a programme organized by the Times Group on the occasion of Vijay Karnataka on Childrens Day.
And they published the letters they chose.
I was very happy to read those letters.
These little children also know the problems of the country.
They also know about the discussions in the country.
Congratulating the Kirti Hegde, Digital India and Smart City schemes from Uttarkanada, the child says that our education system has to be transformed and today's children don't like classroom reading, they like to know about nature.
If we give children information about nature, it may be beneficial for the protection of the environment in the future.
Reeda Nadaf, a child from Lakshmeshwar, writes that she is proud of being a soldier's daughter.
Any Indian who is not proud of our soldiers
And it's very natural to be proud of the military's daughter.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi writes that the school is 5 kilometers away from the house, so we have to leave home early and return home late night.
So she says she can't spend time with friends and she says she wants to be a school next.
But I liked that the newspaper had done what it wanted to bring to me, so I could read the letters.
I have a good experience.
My dear people, today's 2611.
November 26 is our Constitution Day.
This is the same day in 1949 that the Constituent Assembly accepted the Constitution of India.
The Constitution came into existence on January 26, 1950, so we celebrate the Republic Day that is, Republic Day.
The Constitution of India is the soul of our democracy.
Today is a day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They worked for about three years to build the Constitution of India.
Those who read this discussion feel proud of what the thoughts of those dedicated to the nation were.
Can we imagine how hard they made to build the Constitution of our country with diverse diversity
When the country is free from the slavery of the slave, how much will they have expressed their integrity and long vision.
It's not an area of untouchable life, it's not a matter of nature.
Equality and sympathy for everyone is the face of our Constitution.
It is our duty to follow the Constitution in terms of literature.
Be it citizen or ruler, we must move forward with the feelings of the Constitution.
The message of our Constitution is that no one should suffer any kind of damage.
Seventeen separate committees were formed based on important issues in the Constituent Assembly.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar was chaired by the drafting committee of the Constitution.
He was playing a great role.
On 6th December, we remember and remember him as usual on his Mahanirvana Day.
Baba Saheb's contribution in making the country prosperous and strong is unforgettable.
On December 15, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel is the holy day.
Sardar Patel became a steel man of the country from the farmer's son and he made an extraordinary right to coordinate on a road in the country.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the Constitutional Constituent Assembly.
He was chaired by the Advisory Committees for the welfare of basic rights, fundamental rights, Minority and tribals.
The brave citizens, the police and the security officers remember and salute all those who lost their lives.
This country can never forget their sacrifices.
Terrorism is taking a terrible shape today in every part of the world as a daily event.
We have suffered a lot in India for the past 40 years due to terrorism.
Thousands of innocent people lost their lives.
Terrorism is challenging humanism.
This is the land that has given the message of non-violence and affection to the world through Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak and Mahatma Gandhi.
Terrorism and terrorism are making a cruel effort to weaken and segregate our social relations.
Therefore, the need of the hour is to be more aware of human powers.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Navy Day and Navy Day on December.
You all know that our culture has grown on the banks of the rivers.
This country has an unprecedented relationship with our land and the oceans.
If we look towards history, the rival naval force was considered the most powerful naval force in the past 800-900 years.
In the growth of the Cholasam empire, their naval forces played a major role in making them the economic superpower of that time.
Several examples of the initiatives and exploration journeys of the Chola Navy can be seen in collaboration.
Very few people know that most of the world's naval forces have been granting women in the war naval for a long time.
However, many women had played an important role in the Chhola Navy, 800-900 years ago.
Women were also involved in the war.
The Chola rulers were well aware of the construction of ships.
When we talk about the Navy, anyone can forget his ability to build Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and his naval forces.
The Konkan coast was in the country of Shivaji Maharaj.
Several forts like Sindhudurg, Murud Jamjira and Golden Fort related to Shivaji Maharaj were either on the sea shore or surrounded by sea.
The Maratha Navy was waiting for the security of these forts.
There were large ships and small boats in the Maratha Navy.
Their naval forces were very capable of attacking any enemy and protecting the country from enemies.
How do we remember Kanhoji Angre when we remember the Maratha Navy
He brought the Maratha Naval Force to a new level and built the Maratha Navy camps at various places.
After independence, our Indian Navy has shown its valour on various occasions, whether in the departure of Goa or in the war of India-Pakistan in 1971.
When we talk about the naval force, the war is in the eyes, but the naval forces of India have come forward with the same enthusiasm in humanitarian affairs.
The ship Sumitra helped save the people immediately and handed over many people involved in fishing to Bangladesh safely from the sea.
In May-June this year, when there was a huge flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our Navy arrived there and helped the government and the people there.
On November 21, when a trade ship was robbed in the West Galf, INS Trikund came to help.
Our naval forces have been proud to take healthcare to Fuji, to provide immediate relief and to provide humanitarian assistance to the neighbouring country at the time of accident, and we Indians are always proud and respected to our security forces.
Whether it is the Armed Forces or the Navy or the Air Force, every Indian salutes them in the name of the courage, valour, valour, valour, valour and sacrifice of our soldiers.
They sacrifice their youth for the nation to live comfortably and peacefully for 100 crore people.
The Army Flag Day is celebrated every year on 7th December.
It is a day to pride and respect the soldiers of the country.
I am glad that this time the Ministry of Defence has decided to organise a programme from 1st to 7th December and the programme is to come to the citizens of the country and inform people about the Armed Forces and make people aware.
Children and elders should wear the flag throughout the week.
There must be an effort to respect the army in the country.
They can call the soldiers in schools and colleges and get information about the army.
Our new generation can make it a good opportunity to learn about the army.
This opportunity is to contribute funds for the benefit of all the soldiers of our Armed Forces.
This fund is being used through the Military Welfare Board for rehabilitation of the families of the soldiers who have been martyred in the war, for the help of the injured soldiers.
We can also contribute to their good.
I would like to tell our farmer brothers and sisters something.
Soil is a great part of the earth.
All we eat is related to this soil.
In a way, the food chain is connected to the soil.
Imagine what happens if there is no soil produced in this world.
I'm afraid of thinking.
We have already thought about this in our culture, so we have been aware of the importance of the earth since ancient times.
On the one hand in our culture, there is a natural endeavour to be with agriculture, with soil, devotion and gratitude and on the other hand scientific schemes to keep nutrition from soil were part of life.
Two things were important in the lives of the farmers of this country - devotion to soil and scientific conservation of soil.
We are privileged that the farmers of our country are associated with traditions and interested in modern sciences, try to take appropriate decisions.
I have heard about the farmers of Tehu village in Bhorand Block in Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
Crop has been reduced and the income has also been reduced and the production capacity of soil has gradually reduced.
Some farmers in the village understood the seriousness of this situation and agreed to suggest how many chemicals, other crops, micro nutrients and bio-forestation should be provided by their soil testing at the right time.
You will be surprised to know what has happened due to the advice of the soil health check-up.
In addition, the quality of soil has also increased.
If you want to think about crops, then the farmers have started feeling that if you want to think about the Mother Earth and prepare to protect the Mother Earth, the Mother of Earth will save us.
Our farmers have created more than 10 crore soil health cards across the country to know the soil well and to harvest it accordingly.
We have devotion to the Mother of Earth, but have you thought how much harm is the health of the Mother Earth with chemicals like urea
In all scientific ways, the use of urea has proved to be serious harm to the earth.
Can our farmers and children of our soil take a decision to use the urea used in the farming sector in 2022 after 75 years of independence
We have started feeling global temperature and climate change.
There was a time when the winter started before Diwali.
Now, in the beginning of December, the cold has gradually moved.
The 8-year-old unspeakable kid made Visil his weapon.
After 5 o'clock in the morning, he climbed to the houses of the village and woke up people and started teaching them that they should not urinate in the open space.
This child who went to 30-40 houses every day and taught about cleanliness, the village of Kumhari was free from open defecation.
The younger child Tushar inspired in promoting cleanliness.
Our divine brothers and sisters are determined, talented and courageous.
We've got to learn something for a minute.
Today they work well in every field.
In the field of sports or in any competition or in any social initiative, our disabled people are not behind anyone.
Our divine sportspersons have won four medals in Rio Olympics, and you all remember the blind T20 Cricket Champions in the World Cup.
Different kinds of competitions are being held across the country.
Last day, the fifteenth National Para Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Our young brothers and sisters from different parts of the country have participated in this event and showcased their skills.
One of them is Giger Tucker from Gujarat and 80 percent of his body does not have muscles.
As a result of his skill, he was chosen by the Sports Authority of India 2020 Paralympics.
He is one of the 32 Para swimmers trained at the Centre for Excellence in Gandhinagar.
My salute to Jigar Thakur... and I congratulate him.
Today, Divyangjans can reach any area and focus on opportunities.
Our endeavour is to make everyone capable of the country and create a society inclusive of all.
After a few days, Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi will be celebrated.
A prophet Hasrat Mohammad Saheb was born on this day.
My heartfelt congratulations to all the countrymen.
This suggestion is very good, but I think it's very good to add and change something to this suggestion.
The elders of our village will always say.
Forget grief, don't let you forget happiness.
Can't you make your role in this
Come, let us share good things in the Narendra Modi App, in the MiGOV or in the social media in Positive India.
Remember the events that inspire others.
If you remember good things, you'll have a sense of doing good.
It's the energy to do good.
We can see the strength and consequences of this united unity.
There's a lot of chance to say.
PM on 29th October, 2017
In the Chhath Puja, the sun and water are important but bamboo and mud-made utensils and pottery are essential related to its worship.
In this festival of faith, the message of worshiping sunrise and sunset is full of unique culture.
The world will respect and worship those who are born.
But Chhath Puja is a message to those who are certain.
The importance of cleanliness in our lives is also associated with this festival.
Before the sixth day, the entire house is cleaned and people are actively involved in the shores of rivers, lakes and ponds, priesthoods such as cleaning of ghats.
Suryavandhan or Chhath Puja, Environmental Conservation, Disease Reduction and Achievement are celebrated.
It is natural for anyone to feel proud of this great tradition of India.
You might have been happy to hear that there was so much business in a store of khadi and handicrafts.
During Diwali, the sale of Khadi Gift Copper has been recorded at around 680.
The total sale of Khadi and artisans has shown an increase of about 90 over the previous year.
Today, it shows that the youth, women and people of all ages love Khadi and Handicraft.
I can imagine how much wealthy families, poor families, how many families have been working in handlooms.
He says we should remember our brave security personnel.
We're also supposed to bring sweets home to the soldiers.
With the brave security personnel in the border, I have got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali once again.
This time, I have been unforgettable to celebrate Diwali with security personnel in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
Our security forces respect all the soldiers of our security forces for the war, dedication and sacrifice of the country, for the sake of the country.
If we get the opportunity, listen to their prideful stories to know the experiences of our soldiers.
Many of us do not know that the soldiers of our security forces are playing an important role not only in our borders but also in establishing peace all over the world.
The Peace Keeper of the United Nations is enhancing the status of Hindustan all over the world.
On the last day, on 24th October, the UN Day was celebrated throughout the world.
Everyone remembers the efforts of the United Nations to establish peace in the world and their active role.
We believe the Vasudhaiva family, that is, the whole world is our family.
Due to this belief, India has been actively participating in various important steps of the United Nations since the beginning.
India has always given priority to women equality and the declaration of human rights of the United Nations is a living example of this.
It was proposed in the earliest continent that every man was born free and equitable and as a result of the efforts of India's representative Hansa Mehta, it was acknowledged that every man was born free and equitable.
Looks like it's a very simple change, but it's a healthy idea.
The greatest contribution of India to the United Nations is the UN Peace Mission.
India has always played an active role in the UN peacekeeping missions.
Some of you will be the first time to know this.
Over 16,000 Indian security personnel have served in the UN peacekeeping missions.
Now about 7,000 Indian soldiers are connected to the peace processes of the United Nations and India is the third place in the world.
By August 27, Indian soldiers have served in nearly 50 missions of 71 peace destinations across the world of the United Nations.
These missions were in various parts of the world, including Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Kongo, Cyprus, Liberia, Laban and Sudan.
In Kong and South Sudan, more than 20,000 patients have been treated and rescued by Indian Army hospitals.
The security forces of India not only saved the people of different countries but also captured their minds through public harmony.
Indian women have also played a lead in establishing peace.
No one knows that India is the first country to send women police teams to the United Nations Peace Mission in Libya.
This move of India has become an inspiration for the nations across the world.
After that, all the countries started sending their women police teams.
You will be surprised to hear that India's role is not only in peace but also in about 85 countries.
Our brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha have conveyed the message of peace and harmony all over the world.
Peace Mission measures are not simple.
The soldiers of our security forces have to work through inaccessible areas.
We have to live among different people.
We must know and understand different environments and different cultures.
You must change yourself with the local requirements and environments.
Today, when we remember our brave United Nations Peacekeepers, who can forget Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria, who fought for peace in Kongo, Africa, and sacrificed his service.
Remembering him, all Indians will be proud of their chests.
In 1989, at the age of 75, he served him as the Operation Forces Commander in Namibia and served the country's independence institution.
General Timeya Cyprus, the Chief of the Indian Army, led the United Nations Peace Force and sacrificed everything for peace.
As India is a peaceful messenger, there has always been a message of peace, unity and harmony throughout the world.
We believe that everyone should live with peace and harmony and move towards a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our holy land was brightened by the great men who have selflessly served humanity.
We were one of the extraordinary people, Sister Nivedita, who called Bhagini Nivedita.
Though Margaret Elizabeth Nobel lived in Ireland, Swami Vivekananda named him Nivedita.
The word Nivedita was completely dedicated.
Then they dedicated themselves to the name and made the name unemployed.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
They were ready to sacrifice their lives with the influence of Swami Vivekananda and dedicate their lives to the poor.
Sister Nivedita's heart was hurt in the attacks in British rule.
Not only did the British slave our country, but they tried to make us mentally slave.
They have been striving hard to create an absurd feeling among us by showing our culture.
Bhagini reinstated the pride of Indian culture.
The revolutionary woman of the famous nationalist and Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati is famous for women empowerment.
Its inspiration is said to be Bhagini Nivedita.
Jagdish Chandrabos, a great scientist of Bhagini Nivedita, worked in collaboration with him.
They helped in propagating Bose research through articles and conferences.
Indias unique beauty is spirituality and science in our culture.
Sister Nivedita and Jagdish Chandrabose are strong examples of this.
Hundreds of people died when the terrible plague spread in Kolkata in 1899.
Cleanliness work has been started in the runways and roads without considering their own health.
Sister Nivedita, a woman who came out to serve the poor, had lived a pleasant life.
Inspired by this sacrifice, people came forward to collaborate in service matters.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, my best wishes to all children on our first Prime Minister, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru on his birth anniversary.
Children are the greatest heroes and heroes in the construction of a New India.
Your anxiety is true that the diseases that had been afflicted with the diseases of old people and the diseases that had been suffering from the evening of life have been seen in children nowadays.
It is surprising to hear that children are also afflicted with diabetes .
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are a lifestyle disorder.
The main reason for such diseases is the deficiency of physical activity in lifestyle like physical activity and change in food habits.
The society and the families have to pay attention to this.
If you think about this, you can't see anything special.
It is necessary to make small things properly, and make them habitual and make them their own habits.
Instead of climbing up and descending on the lift children make a habit of climbing up and walking stairs .
After dinner, try to take some children to the whole family.
Yoga for Young India, Yoga for Youth India.
I'm saying that I'm habitual. Any old man can make it easier.
It's simple because it's simple to learn ineffective, it's simple to say that wherever it can be done, it's simple.
It doesn't need special equipment or plains.
Several studies are being carried out in terms of the benefits of Yoga in controlling diabetes.
We need to make Ayurveda and Yoga a part of life without seeing Ayurveda as a medium of medicine.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends and sportspersons have conveyed good news in the past.
Our sportspersons have served the country in different sports.
In Hockey, India won the Asia Cup Hockey crown through good sports.
Our sportspersons played a good game, that is why India was able to become Asia Cup champions after 10 years.
Earlier, India won the Asia Cup in 2003 and 2007.
My best wishes to the entire team and the sports staff who helped them.
After Hockey, India has heard a good news in Batminton.
Batminton Star Kidambi Srikanth made Indians proud to win the Denmark Open Crown by showing the best sports.
Super Series Crown Crown was won after Indonesia Open and Australian Opening.
I convey my best wishes to our young friends for this achievement and enhancing the pride of India.
Friends, FIFA Under 17 World Cup competitions were held this month.
All teams from all over the world came to India and showcased their skills in the football field.
I had an opportunity to see a game.
The sportspersons and audience were very excited.
The World Cup competitions were successfully conducted and all the teams showed their best sports.
The young sportspersons of India have not been able to win the crown in India.
The festival was enjoyed all over the world including India and the tournament was attractive and attractive for football lovers.
Football's future is bright.
Once again, I convey my best wishes to all the sportspersons and those who have worked with them.
Some of them send photographs of the missions of children, some of them are the story of the collective efforts of the youth.
There, a team of non-governmental organisation called Ecological Protection Organization (EPO) went out to clean the fort of Chandrapur.
During this two-and-a-half-day work, people continued to work as a group without fatigue.
I am amazed to see the picture and I am surprised to see the surrounding hygiene that you will be disappointed and disappointed to realise the dream of sanitation and that you will see the youth of the Ecological Protector Organisation, their sweat, their zeal, their zeal and their vision in that vibrant picture.
If you see it, you'll be disappointed and trusted.
This grand effort for cleanliness is a wonderful example of beauty, harmony and harmony.
My dear countrymen, we will celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on 4th November.
By eating together, people have a sense of unity and equality.
Guru Nanak Dev ji gave three messages to the meaningful life - to conquer the name of God, to study and help the needy.
Guru Nanak Dev had created Guruvani to say to him.
In the coming year 2019, we are going to celebrate the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev.
Come, let's try to move through his message and the path of his teachings.
My dear countrymen, after two days, on 31st October, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We all know that he has laid the foundation stone for modern integral India.
We can learn a lot if we travel through the extraordinary life of that great son of India.
His expertise was bringing thoughts to work.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the threshold of the work that surpasses India on a road.
He asserted that millions of Indians should be brought under the bottom of a nation, a Constitution.
His ability to make a strong decision gave him the ability to overcome all obstacles.
He had set a goal, he was moving forward and moving towards that goal.
He could have done this thing to unite the country.
Everyone was equal to a nation in his imagination.
I would like to say that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has said and always inspires us.
These words of Sardar Saheb are inspiring and attractive to our vision of New India even today.
That is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
I urge you all to participate in this festival of mutual understanding that you too are for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holiday of Deepawali, with a new will, with a new determination, all of you will be able to drive your daily life again.
I wish all the people of the country to fulfill their dreams.
It has been three years since the start of the Mann Ki Baat programme that you understand through the skyline.
Today is the thirty-sixth episod.
When I talk about Mann Ki Baat, I can talk about those who send their minds from all corners of the country, but I get a lot of treasure.
I'm more inspiring.
Some things are about reforming government matters.
Sometimes there are individual complaints, sometimes it attracts attention to social problems.
Whenever I say Mann Ki Baat, I remember one thing that Acharya Vinoba Bhave said.
Today, after three years, I am sure that social scientists, universities, researchers, media experts etc. will make this analysis.
I am sure that this discussion will be beneficial for Mann Ki Baat in the future and it will get a new spirit and a new energy.
Mann Ki Baat said we should take it as much as we need when we eat, don't be funny.
However, letters came from every corner of the country, social organisations and youth.
After that, many people have come forward to do such work for cleanliness.
Besides, not only in India but also in the world, the Selfish with Door has become a major initiative.
This is not just a matter of social media.
Every girl has become a new self-confidence and a new pride.
Every parents started feeling like taking their own daughter's selfie.
All the girls started feeling that they have significance and importance.
Last day I was discussing with the Department of Tourism...
I told those who left for tourism wherever they went, they wanted to send photographs in touch with India.
Millions of photographs and pictures of all corners of India have become a big economy for those working in the tourism sector in a way.
I am aware of Mann Ki Baat that the small events are creating a huge mass movement.
It's been three years since the events of the last three years have come to light.
The country is moving through the right path.
This is a big capital for any country, a big power.
I salute people with my heart.
Once I spoke of Mann Ki Baat Khadi, Khadi said that Khadi is not a cloth, but an ideal.
Young people see the interest of tail Khadi at home, the swords, the swords and the swords.
Khadi's sales have increased, so the poor houses are directly linked to employment.
Khadiq Rebate is being given from 2nd October and it is very expensive.
This will provide strength to the poor in our country and we will do it.
Due to the increase in interest of Khadi, the people working in Khadi sector have increased the zeal of thinking in a new way in the tail and the people associated with Khadi in the government.
How to bring new technologies, how to enhance productivity, how to bring solar-cathery
The ancient heritage has been destroyed for 20, 25, 30 years... to think about how to revive it.
We have been involved in various kinds of work.
Several people have created employment opportunities.
The Khadi Village Entrepreneurship Division in Pampore, Kashmir has revived its training department and has a lot to contribute to the region.
The resumption of this training centre will help the new generation to build new products for innovative construction and weighing.
Ordinary people and others have been awarded Khadi products as gifts.
In a natural way, we can be able to realize how a thing gets encouraged.
My dear countrymen, we all decided in Mann Ki Baat last month to celebrate the Swachhta Festival in the country on 15 days before Gandhi Jayanti.
Cleanliness will connect with the minds of the people.
Our Honble President started this and the country joined it.
Today, the elderly people, men, women, towns and villages have become a part of the Swachhta Divas.
I express my gratitude to the Honble President.
People from all sections of the country have considered it as their own, and everyone is associated with it.
Be it the sports sector, the film sector, the education sector, the schools, colleges, universities, the farmers, the workers, the officers, the government employees, the police, the soldiers and the services are associated with this.
There has been a change in the public places to prevent others from polluting public places, where the workers have started feeling a little pressure.
It is heartening to note that in the first four days of the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign, more than 75 lakh people have joined the work related to more than 40,000 initiatives.
This time we've seen another thing, we've been cleaning up somewhere, others' attention is not to be cleaned up by awareness.
But if cleanliness is a habit, then it should be an emotional change.
This time Fisheries also took place along with Swachhata Hi Seva.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the lecture related to sanitation.
Thousands of children came in colorful pictures.
I don't forget to thank the media persons when it comes to cleanliness.
They have taken this mass movement very purely.
They have joined themselves in their own way and contributed immensely in creating a vibrant environment.
A few days ago, somebody paid my attention to the work of 18-year-old Bilal Dar in Srinagar.
Shri Nagarjun Bill Dar has been ambassadors to his brand in terms of hygiene, while talking about Brandy Ambassador, you will think he will be a hero in the sports sector.
On seeing plastics, polythenes, bottles and other shoes, Bilal takes it away and makes a little income.
Bilal's corpus ration gave a vehicle and gave a uniform and he goes to other places and tells people the lessons of sanitation, inspires people and stands behind it until they see the results.
Bilal Dar is a young child in age, but he is an inspiration for all those interested in cleanliness.
I congratulate Bill Dar.
My dear countrymen, we should acknowledge that the history of the future is born in the womb of the present history and when I talk of history, it is natural to remember the great men.
This month of October, we have a number of great men.
In the month of October, from Mahatma Gandhi to Sardar Patel, who had shown us the path to the twenty-fourth century, led us, led us and suffered many hardships for the country.
This is the centenary year of Nanaji and Deendayaljisa.
What was the central point of all these great men
There was a common thing to live for the country, to do something for the country.
Gandhiji, Jaiprakashji and Deendayalji were away from the corridors of power but permissively lived with life and worked for them.
Deendayal Upadhyay and Mahatma Gandhi were talking about the human beings standing at the last end of the society.
Sardar Sab united the country.
We have to move forward to unity.
Have experienced the diversity of this India, touch it, smell it.
You will see that these diversity of our country will work as a big school for the development of your personality.
On holidays, the days of Diwali... we have a habit of traveling somewhere in the country.
The journey of tourists is natural .
But it is a matter of concern that we don't see our country, we don't know the diversity of the country, we don't understand, but it is a matter of concern that it is liked to travel abroad soon after the impact of colour.
The people of western India don't know what is in eastern India.
How many diversity is our country
Keep in mind that when Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and our former President Abdul Kalanji had travelled in India, they had a new inspiration to see, understand, live and die for them.
All these great men travelled all over the weight.
At the beginning of their work, they tried to know and understand India.
Efforts have been made to convince India.
As a student, can we try to understand and embrace our different states, different communities, people, their lifestyles, their traditions, their dresses and their food habits to learn their concepts
The value addition to tourism is not just because we are looking at it, but as a student, we are trying to understand it and become a part of it.
On my own experience, I would have got the opportunity to visit more than 500 districts of the country.
I might have got the opportunity to live in more than 450 districts.
Today, when I demonstrate this responsibility in this India, I am very beneficial to experience those journeys.
I facilitate understanding things.
I appeal to you that you have experienced the unity of the diversity of this vast India as a milestone, not as a milestone but as a treasure for our immense power.
It has a dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat.
How many types of food items are there .
You will never have to repeat every day when you eat the whole life.
This is the great strength of our tourism sector.
On this holiday, not only go out of the house, but don't want to leave for a change, go to know and understand something.
Inclusion of India and inclusion of diversity of millions of people.
Your life will be enriched by these experiences.
The limits of your thoughts will expand.
Who's a greater guru than experience
It is usually time for travelling from October to March.
People are traveling.
I am confident that if you go this time, you will take this call forward.
Sharing your experiences wherever you go, share pictures.
Please send photographs on Hash Tag Incredible India.
Please send photographs if you can intervene with the people in the moving place.
Not only buildings, but also of natural beauty, pictures of the life of the people there.
Write a good article about the journey.
Send to My Gavi, send it to Narendra Modi App.
I am sure that the seven best tourist destinations in your state have been discovered by all Indians about those seven places or seven things will be good for promoting tourism in India.
If possible, you should go to the seven places.
Can you give you some information about it
The Government will acknowledge the films about such good places, make video and promote them.
You can also be an inspiration to promote tourism through the time from October to March.
I invite you for that.
My mind has a deep impact.
I'm a man like you.
You must have noticed one thing that happened last day and people have seen a divine example of women's power and patriotism.
Its abnormality is that the husbands of freedom and funds are sacrificed by serving Mother India.
Would we imagine what the mindset would be without life at this young age
But Sacrificial Colonel Anand Mahadiq's wife, Swati Mahadik, directly committed to this terrible situation and joined the Indian Army.
He was trained for 11 months and changed his life to realise the dreams of the husband.
His wife fund took a firm decision and joined the army.
It is natural for all people to feel respect for these valours.
I convey my best wishes to the two sisters.
They are a new inspiration and curiosity among millions of people in the country.
My best wishes to the two sisters.
Dear countrymen, there is a great opportunity for our younger generation between the Navratri festival and Diwali.
FIFA Under-17 World Cup is walking in our country.
I'm sure the football will be all around.
The interest of every generation in football will increase.
My dear countrymen, this is Navratri.
It's time to worship Durgambay.
The whole atmosphere is smelling pure and pure.
All around is the atmosphere of spirituality, festival and devotion.
It is believed to be the festival of Shakti Sadhana.
On the 75th anniversary of India's independence in 2022, we will move ahead with a five-year framework to realise the dreams of freedom lovers, the determination of 250 crore people, the hard work, the hard work and the determination.
Thank you very much.
English rendering of the text of Prime Ministers Speech by Akashwani via Akashwani to the people of India on 27th August, 2017 at 11.
My dear countrymen are greeted with respect.
On the one hand, when the country is immersed in festivals, on the other hand, on hearing the news of violence from any part of Hindustan, it is natural to be disturbed in the country.
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi and is the country of Sardar Patel, who lived for the unity of the country.
Over the centuries, our ancestors have accepted the values of public life, non-violence and mutual respect, that is part of our mind.
We have been saying Ahimsa Paramodharma since childhood.
In the name of faith, I said from the Red Fort that it will not allow violence, whether it is religious belief or political belief or faith in traditions.
There is a provision for justice for every individual in the Constitution which Babasaheb Ambedkar gave us.
Those who take the law, those who laugh in the way of violence, whether individual or society, this country will never be allowed, no government will be allowed.
Everyone will have to head before the law.
The law will determine the responsibility and punish the culprits.
Our country is full of diversity and these diversities are not confined to food, lifestyle or dresses.
We can see diversity at all levels of life.
Our festivals also have diversity.
Our cultural heritage for centuries old, it will be seen that there will be no day of celebration in 365 days, even if we look at cultural traditions, social traditions and historical events.
If we look at all our festivals, we can see that there is no festival connected to the time of nature.
Everything is directly linked to nature.
Our festivals are linked to farmers and are directly linked to those who are engaged in fisheries.
Today, when I talk about festivals, I first want to tell you Michami Dukadam.
Yesterday, the festival of 'Savatsari' was held in the Jain community.
In the Jain community, the festival of tourism is held in the month of Bhadra.
The last day of the festival is the anniversary of the festival.
This is a really surprising tradition.
The festival of Sanvasari is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
It is called 'Shamavani' festival and on this day there is a tradition of congratulating each other as 'Mishami Dukadam'.
In our scientific scientific sciences, 'Shama Veerasya Bhushan', that is, 'Shama Veerunu Bhushan'.
The sorry man becomes heroic.
Mahatma Gandhi always used to say, "It is the specialty of a strong man.
Referring to the significance of forgiveness in the Merchant of Venezy, the Shakespeare wrote, "Mersey Is Times Blast, It Blast Him to Give Him to the Text", which means the forgiveness and forgiveness of God.
My dear countrymen, this is the time when Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in every corner of India.
Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations take place for ten days.
This festival is also a symbol of unity, equality and cleanliness.
My best wishes to all the people of the country for the Ganesh festival.
It's time for the festival of Ona in Kerala.
Onam is one of the colorful festivals of India, a major festival of Kerala.
This is of social and cultural importance.
Onam shows the rich cultural ties of Kerala.
This festival gives a message of love and harmony in the society and reflects new enthusiasm, new aspirations and new faith in the minds of the people.
Now this festival has become an incentive for encouraging tourism.
In Gujarat, Navratri Festival and Durga Puja Festival in Bengal have become attractive in a way.
Our festivals are also an opportunity to attract foreigners.
We should think of what we can do in this regard.
Idul Suha will also be celebrated in the gathering after a few days.
Besides being a symbol of devotion and faith, we have to make it a symbol of cleanliness in a New India.
My dear countrymen, the descriptions of modernization are changing.
Several types of tests are being conducted in every family.
See how big change is, how pleasant it is.
As I said, the whole country is full of intellectual awakening.
I'm very happy to know about somebody's new inventions.
Someone said that an engineer collected some specific soil and added it and trained to build a Ganesha idol.
When you offer the Ganesh in the water of a small bag, it melts quickly in the water.
He didn't stop so much.
Three years ago, the Swachhta Abhiyan will start and it will be three years on 2nd October.
Its benefits have begun to be seen.
Toilets were 39 per cent, now 67 per cent.
More than two lakh thirty thousand villages have been declared free from defecation.
Many people lost their lives.
But after the flood, when the water was flooded, the waste was spread all over the place.
We can create an environment of sanitation throughout the country.
After construction of toilets, you can join the portal with your own name and the name of your family helped.
In this, you can write in different languages, there is no age.
You can make a short film on your own mobile.
A 2-3-minute short film that inspires cleanliness can be produced.
In any language, it can be a quiet picture.
Work yourself as a partner in this.
You will see how bright this Gandhi Jayanti Day will be on 2nd October.
After the 15-day long waste-building, after the Swachhta Maan Seva programme, we will be happy to pay homage to the respected Bapu on 2nd October when we celebrate Gandhi Jayanti.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to convey a special contribution to you.
I look forward to your message as much as you're waiting for Mann Ki Baat.
I'm looking forward to every thing you say, because I have the opportunity to learn something.
There's an opportunity to change the things I've done.
Your little things are beneficial to think about many things with a new vision.
"Prime Minister, I'm speaking incomplete from Pune.
Once I went to the mall with her shopping.
She spent Rs.2,000 for a sari, spent Rs.450 for a pizza.
But the auto driver, who had to go to the mall, disputed about five rupees.
Buying vegetables in the return route, the price paid for 4-5 rupees in the name of it.
I feel so bad.
We give money at large places without questioning the price, but they describe the brothers and sisters who depend on us for a few rupees.
They disbelieve.
You must tell me about this in Mann Ki Baat.
Madam, I am grateful for making a great message through this heart-spoken phone call.
I am sure my people will certainly leave it if this habit is done in the face of the poor.
My dear young friends, on August 29, the sports day will be celebrated all over the country.
This is the birthday of Major Dhyan Chand, a great hockey sportsperson, who showcased the light in Hockey.
His contributions to Hockey remained intact.
This is because of the desire to connect with younger sports in our country.
Sports must be part of our life.
If we think of our young country in the world, we should see our children in sports.
Sports means physical fitness, mental alertness and personality enhancment.
What do you want more than this
Sports is in a way an important medicine for the unity of minds.
Young friends, the Ministry of Sports has prepared a sports talent search portal to explore and talent them.
Any child in the country who has made some achievement in the field of sports, can apply a video if you want to individual identification in it.
The portal will be uploaded tomorrow by the Ministry of Sports to select growing sportspersons.
I am happy to tell the youngsters that the FIFA Under 17 World Cup is going to run in India from 6th to 18th October.
24 teams around the world are going to make India their homes.
The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of those six girls working in the Navy inspires us all.
These six girls left the sea in a small bottle called INS Tarini.
It is named Navika Sagar Parikrama.
They will return to India after months of visiting the world.
These six children will drive courageously in the midst of waves in the sea and this is the first time in the world.
My best wishes and blessings to these girls.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, we all celebrate Teachers Day.
He was the President.
But he said he himself was a teacher.
He was a scholar, a diplomat, a President of India, but he was an enthusiastic teacher in every sense.
I salute him.
Excellent scientist, Albert Einstein said that it is the Supreme Art of the Teacher to awaken Oy in Creative Pression and Knowledge that is enjoying creativity and knowledge among his students.
This time when we celebrate Teacher's Day, don't we take a decision
Can you organise a mission like a mission
Teach to Transform, Education to Mpower, teaching to Ed to Ed to Ed, learn to strengthen and lead.
Can this mission be carried forward with this determination
Anyone should take a determination for five years, find a way to achieve it and feel happy to achieve it in five years and succeed in life.
For this, make our schools, our colleges, our teachers and our educational institutions an environment.
When we talk about change in our country, the teacher will be remembered in the society as he remembers the mother in the family.
Teachers have an important role in making changes.
One thing that has been possible to transform anybody's life through a comprehensive effort must have happened in the lives of every teacher.
If we work together, we can contribute to transforming the nation.
We can move with the mantra of teaching for transformation.
Prayer is the Chief Minister.
My name is Dr. Ananya.
I live in Mumbai City and work for the India Research Centre of Harvard University.
As a researcher, I am particularly interested in financial inclusion schemes and social schemes related to it.
I would like to ask you to say that after three years of the Jan Dhan Yojana launched in 2014, India is more secure and more robust, can it be said that empowerment and facilities are available to our women, farmers, workers and villages
With a dream in mind, this movement was started on 28th August 2014.
Tomorrow, on 28th August, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be extended for three years.
Thirty crore new families have been linked to this and the bank accounts have been opened.
It is more than the total population of many countries in the world.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, our poor have invested around Rs.
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana are giving birth to a new faith in the lives of those poor people today.
When the poor suffered, some families got Rs. 2 lakhs in a few days due to insurance of one rupee when they lost their lives.
They will be inspired by this scheme and hundreds of examples have come to me about how many changes in the lives of a person, how new energy fills up and how new faith fills up.
They can inspire the new generation by introducing such people.
My dear countrymen, I once again convey my best wishes to Michami.
Thank you very much.
The specialty of the human mind is that the rainy season attracts the heart very much.
As a result of changing climate and environment, there are very negative conditions.
Over the past few days, in some parts of India, particularly in Assam, North Eastern States, Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Bengal, people have suffered calamities due to heavy rains.
The State Governments are also making possible efforts to help the flood affected people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and citizens working with service motivation make immense efforts to help people in this environment.
Soldiers, Air Forces, NDRFs, Armed Forces etc. from the Government of India are working with lives to help flood affected people.
Due to floods, the life of the people becomes very bitter.
The NDRF team was appointed.
Climate warnings are almost available due to the development of technologies and the progress in environmental science.
As per the climate indicators, the timeline of our actions can be determined by slowly transforming our actions into a habit and we can avoid great destruction.
When I prepare for Mann Ki Baat, I see that the citizens of the country are preparing it more than me.
I heard your speech on Chartered Accountants Day, and it was very impressed with me.
Similarly, Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been started last month.
I am glad to hear that there is a dearth of things. In the north-eastern regions, in the far-flung hilly areas, a person living in the jungles, I was afraid of the bills, and now I started to understand things.
From one place to another, it sees how much time is reduced and how much the buses in the highways are.
Pollution is decreasing due to the speed of trucks.
It's gonna go a long way.
This has created a new belief throughout the country by the speed that has transformed in a simple manner, the speed that has transformed from one way to the other, the new registrations have taken place.
Once again, I am confident that economists, managing experts and technologists will see India as a model in the world over for implementing GST.
A case study will be set up for all the universities in the world.
Because such a huge change has brought us to the peak of success because it has been successfully implemented in such a large country with the participation of millions of people.
The world will definitely learn about it.
All States have a role in implementing this GST and all States have responsibility.
All decisions, States and Central Governments have been taken together.
The greatest dream of 'One Nation-One Tax' has been successful.
I have been able to see how the officers from the village to the centre worked with dedication and how much a friendly environment was created between the government and the traders and the consumers and how much was the role played in increasing their faith.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries, all the departments and officers of the Union and State Governments.
GST is an excellent example of the success of the social power of India.
It's a history.
In a way, this is the initiative of social reform.
I once again salute millions of people of the country for making such a big effort successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is the month of the revolution.
On August 15, 1947, the country became free.
In the month of August, several events are related to the freedom struggle.
This year we are going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the uit India Movement.
Our new generation should know what happened on August 9, 1942.
From 1857 to 1942, people gathered together with the freedom struggle, tried and suffered.
We are inspired by the magnificent India of history.
The people of India united against the British rule.
According to the call of Mahatma Gandhi, millions of Indians were dedicated to fight life with the mantra of 'Work or Death'.
Millions of youngsters of the country have started their studies and books.
They went off after listening to the voice of freedom.
On 9th August, Mahatma Gandhi had issued the call of India Chhodo, but all the big leaders had been jailed by the British rule, which was the second generation led by Dr.
Mahapurushans like Lohya and Jayaprakash Narayan were the leading leaders.
Everything behind this success was the population, the ability of the people, the determination of the people, the fight for the people.
This effort, which took place from 1857 to 1942, led this movement to its domination in 1942.
Within five years, in 1947, the British had to leave India.
I'd like to connect you to the mathematics.
In 1947, we got freedom.
Today is 2017.
For nearly 70 years.
The governments have come.
There were successes.
Hopes awake.
There were decisive years to achieve the determination from 1942 to 1947.
We have come forward for five years to achieve the goal of our commitment from 2017 to 2022 and we can celebrate the 15th of August 2017 as an opportunity for our commitment.
Millions of decisions.
We can try to achieve millions of decisions.
We have to take a pledge in this regard.
2017 must be our dream year.
We must be part of the vision of this August month.
Today it is not necessary to work or die but to join the dream of a New India, to work with the mind and body to achieve success, to live with this dream, to work with this dream.
In the next five years, we will have to make a decision to be witnessed.
Youth organisations, student organisations and non-governmental organisations can organize social discussions.
Let's bring new ideas forward.
Where do we go as a nation
What can be my contribution as a person
With technology, move forward with video, post, blog, articles and new ideas.
Make this goal a massive.
uit India quiz is also being started for the youth in the Narendra Modi App.
This problem is an attempt to connect the youth with the glorious history of the country and introduce freedom fighters.
You must give it a comprehensive propaganda and bring it to the people.
This time, I invite you, surely tell your suggestions on the MyGov App or the Narendra Modi App.
I will read it myself and try to tell them in time as long as I get it on August 15.
I'm supposed to finish it in 40-45-50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I want to tell you one more thing today.
The economy of India has a socio-economic philosophy.
We don't see it costly.
Our festivals and festivals are not only an opportunity to enjoy.
Our festivals and festivals are the efforts of social reform.
It connects the individual and the society.
Thousands of jobs are linked to this festival, such as rakhi manufacturers, rakhi sellers, sweets sellers.
This is why the families of our dear brothers and sisters live.
We burn lamps to Diwali - it is not just a celebration of light, it is not just a celebration or adornment of houses.
It is directly linked to the poor families that build soil clay bars.
But today, when I talk about festivals and the economic level of the poor associated with them, I would like to talk about the environment as well.
Whenever I think that the people of this country are aware and more active than ever.
For the last one month, citizens have written letters to me about the environment.
They urged Ganesh Chaturthi to give priority to the environment friendly Ganesh and people to plan to love Ganesh with soil.
I'm driven to the citizens of this kind of awareness.
This time I'm saying this before.
I'm sure you'll be with me.
This will help its artisans and poor artists and they will get jobs through the creation of statues.
The poor's belly filled.
Come, let us connect our festivals with the poor, connect the poor with the economic conditions of the poor, let us make the joy of our celebrations a financial celebration of the poor and we should try this.
I extend my best wishes to all the people of the country for the various festivals and festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly watching the girls of our country, whether in the country's education sector, in the economic sector, in the social sector, in the sports sector, in the field of sports.
We, the people of this country feel proud of our daughters.
Last day, our girls showed great performance in the Women's Cricket World Cup.
The pressure on their faces was a manifestation.
I've evaluated things in another way.
I said, look, hopes are very high in this period of media.
Whether you win the game or not, you have won the minds of 125 crore people.
The younger generation of the country, especially our girls, are actually working very hard to enhance the talent of our country.
Once again I congratulate the younger generation of the country, especially our daughters, and extend my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, I remind you of the August Revolution, remind you of August 9 and remind you of August 15.
2022 reminds me of the 75th anniversary of independence.
Make every countrymen pledge and make every countrymen plans for five years to realize the dreams.
We have to take the country to new heights, reach and reach.
Come on, let's go together, let's do something.
We can progress with the belief that the future of the country will be bright.
Climate changes.
Climate is comfortable due to heavy rains in various parts of the country.
Cold winds have been relieved from heat during the last few days.
Whatever the busyness in life, however stress in life or in public life, the rainy season changes our mindset.
Today, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is being celebrated with great respect and happiness in various parts of the country.
Now in many parts of the world, Lord Jagannath's Rathotsav is being celebrated.
Those who learnt about Baba Saheb Ambedkar knew that he praised the temple and traditions of Lord Jagannath because they included social justice and social equality.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
In English, a few people might know the word Jagrnat, which means that no one can stop.
Looking at the meaning of this Jagarnat's neighbourhood, this word appears to be from the chariot of Lord Jagannath.
We can understand how the world has made this chariot of Jagannath in their own way.
Everyone celebrated the holy month of Ramsan with rituals and rituals.
It's here now.
On this occasion of Eid-ul-Fitr, I convey my best wishes to all.
The month of Ramsan is the month of holy donation, the month of happiness sharing.
In this holy month of Ramsan, I remembered an inspirational incident in the village of Mubarakpur in Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
The families of our Muslim brothers and sisters coming to nearly 3500 live in that small village and in a way the sisters of the Muslim family are more than the population there.
At this time, the villagers decided to build a toilet together.
This amount of Rs. 17 lakh will be spent on the other needs of the village.
I congratulate all the villagers of Mubarakpur for making this auspicious occasion of Ramsan an opportunity for the welfare of the society.
Everything they do is inspire.
The most important thing is that they made Mubarakpur Open Defecation Free.
Three states of Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala were already declared Open Defecation Free States.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana were also announced.
I express my gratitude to the government, officers and the common man of these five states.
Then the habit of body and mind will change.
Cleanliness is the same.
Some bad habits are part of our habits.
Last day, a very good thing came to my notice, and I would like to tell you.
The event is in the Vijayanagar district of Andhra Pradesh.
What was the goal
Construction of 10,000 toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats within 100 hours.
My dear countrymen will be happy to know that in 100 hours the work of construction of toilets has been completed successfully by ordinary people and administration.
71 villages have been defecated.
In and through the knives, through the airways.
Recalling the period of Tripura, Shri Prakash wrote that the date of June 25 was reminded of the Black Age of the history of democracy.
This awakening towards democracy is commendable.
Democracy is not only a system but also a culture.
Itenal Observations is the Press of Liberty - the value of freedom is constant awareness.
Continuous awareness is required in the context of democracy, so things that hurt democracy should also be remembered.
And then we must move towards the good things of democracy.
On June 25, 1975, it was an unforgettable dark night for a democracy.
In a way, the administration was turning the country into a prisoner.
Strike the opponent's voices.
Shri Jaiprakash Narayan, along with the dignitaries of the country, was imprisoned.
The just system couldn't escape from the terrible shadow of the situation.
The newspapers were completely neutralized.
Today, the students of the press sector and those associated with democracy are constantly trying to increase the awareness of the people towards democracy by reminding them of that black period.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also in jail.
Atal ji had written a poem in a year after the announcement of an insurgency, which was described in that poem as the mentality of that time.
My dear countrymen, every Hindustani is proud of the world today.
The 21st June, 2017 became a global event.
From the sea to the mountains, people welcomed the sun rays in the morning.
Any Indian who is not proud of this.
Yoga was not before, but when Yoga was linked to the practice of Yoga, Yoga became a glimpse of the world.
Most of the countries of the world have made Yoga Day an opportunity.
In China, people took Yoga at a height of 2400 metres from the sea level in the world heritage site Machu Pituville, Peruville.
People participated in the shadow of Eiffel Tower in France.
The programme was organized at 70 places in a small country like Singapore and a week long programme was organized.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval for the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and the United Nations.
The Yoga session with Yoga Masters was organized at the United Nations Headquarters.
Officials of the United Nations and diplomats from all over the world participated in this event.
This time, Yoga has once again created the world record.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 50,000 people have created a new world record by doing Yoga together.
I also had the opportunity to participate in the Yoga programme in Lucknow.
Our Armed Forces, including BSF, ITBP, CRPF, CISF, have made Yoga a part of work with their duty.
Some TV channels have also propagated it.
The Honble Prime Minister said that in the recent past, he had said that instead of giving a gift to the people at various places, good books should be given a gift to memories.
This was started during your reign in Gujarat, but in the next few days, the use of Buck is more visible.
Can't you do anything
Can't you do anything to implement books instead of books all over the country
Khadi said it would be Khadi's hand to get a boost.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this program was going on, but after leaving, it left the habit.
But in this programme of Kerala, I was once again awaited.
Now a report has begun to be given below.
We can gradually turn it into a habit.
Boy's age is too low.
You're gonna leave after buying it in your hands.
Welcoming Khadi's calendar, however, the poor families are benefitted.
The cost and cost will be less, and it will be used properly.
It has been so many years, but the queen of Elizabeth has kept the calendar given by Mahatma Gandhi.
Several types of letters are available, many kinds of people are burning.
Last day, when you read a letter, I'm sure to tell you about it.
In the southern part of Tamilnadu, a family from Madurai, Arulmozhi Shravan, gave me a letter.
You know what it was.
Considering the study of children, he spoke of something being done in economic matters and said that the family could have some financial assistance.
I took loans from the bank under the Mudra Yojana and started the work of buying some goods from the market.
Government departments will look after the registration of e-Gems.
It's very interesting to write them to me.
They say, "I got money under the MUDRA scheme, started business and added the list of what I can give in e-Gam and I got the order from the Prime Minister's Office, from the PMO.
It was a new news for me.
They pointed out what they bought in the PMO - the purchase of two thermos was Rs. 1600.
This is the empowerment.
This is the opportunity to boost the start-up of the industry.
It has transparency, empowerment, which has entrepreneurship.
Government e-Marketplace-JAM.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand we are proud of Yoga, on the other hand we can also be proud of our capabilities in space science.
Today, India is not only on earth but also on the environment.
Two days ago, 30 NANO satellites were launched with ISRO-Cartosat-2 Series.
The satellites consisted of India and 15 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
This NANO Satellite launch of India will help in agriculture, agriculture and natural resources.
We remember that ISRO Jisat 19 successfully launched a few days ago.
This was the largest satellite in India's launch satellites so far.
The newspapers in our country compared it to the weight of the elephant.
From this, we can imagine what our scientists are doing in the field of environment.
On June 19, 1000 days of Mangalyaan Mission were completed.
When we successfully discovered the Mangalyaan Mission, the mission was targeted for a total of 6 months.
In recent years, India's Badminton sportsperson Kidambi Shrikanth enhanced the pride of the country by winning the Indonesia campaign.
T.
Usha's Usha School of Athletics has got an opportunity to connect with the inauguration of the Synthetic Track.
As much as we are connected to sports, sportsmanship is also increasing.
Sports play an important role in personality development.
The importance of sports is very high in overall personality development.
There is no shortage of talent in the country.
If children are interested in sports in our family, they should be encouraged.
We all have to dream for the next Olympics.
Once again, my dear countrymen, the rainy season and the continuous festival, together, gives a new experience at this time.
Once again I convey my best wishes to all of you and tell you some other things in the next Mann Ki Baat.
English rendering of the text of Prime Ministers Speech by Akashwani via Akashwani to the people of India on May 28, 2017 at 11 a.m.
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramsan started.
On the arrival of the holy month of Ramsan, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of India and the world, especially the Muslim community.
Prayers, spirituality and donors in Ramsan are very important.
We are a nation that believes in God, denounces God, idolaters and opposes idolaters.
The art of living together has been enlightened by all the ideals, all the ways of worship and traditions of all kinds.
Religions, castes, ideals and traditions are the message of peace and unity.
This holy month of Ramsan will help us move forward in the path of peace, unity and harmony.
Once again I convey my best wishes.
I am glad that many people have experienced me.
He showed me the zeal to tell you directly.
You can't read everything, you can't hear the messages of everyone, and you've got so much information.
But I looked together... some tried to learn music, some tried to learn a new rhythm, some tried to learn some new things in the YouTube, try to learn a new language.
I'm glad that a phone call wants to hear you.
I'm talking to Diksha Katyal.
I've left the habit of reading.
But I decided to read something on this holiday.
When we started reading about the freedom struggle, how many struggles India had to fight for independence and how many sacrifices have been made and how many freedom fighters have been in jail for years.
I inspire Bhagat Singh, who laid down a lot of sacrifice at a young age.
Therefore, I urge you to send a message to the new generation in this regard.
It is a matter of happiness that the new generation wants to know our history, our freedom fighters and those who have sacrificed their lives for this country.
Innumerable great men sacrificed their youth in prisons.
During the freedom struggle, the last great men in the jails have done a lot of literary work.
Their heights have strengthened the freedom struggle of India.
Years ago, I went to Andaman Nicobar once.
The cellular prison went to see.
It's the birth anniversary of Veera Savark.
Veer Sarkar wrote a book Masi Janmathe in jail.
The poets wrote the wall of the prison.
He was locked in a small cell.
A Light and Soundo Show is inspiring.
Those from all the states of India, who spoke all languages, had sacrificed their lives in this cellular jail in Andaman.
My dear countrymen, June is the first Monday of 5 months.
What does it mean to connect with nature
Connectivity with nature is to maintain a good land.
Where is it better than Mahatma Gandhi's words
Mahatma Gandhi had often said, "We should also remember the unsighted world" (One Mast Care Abode A World One Wind C) that is, we should also think of the unprecedented world where we have to maintain it.
Nature has a power...
You might have experienced that when you get tired then how much energy will be if you pour a glass of water on your face .
If you open the windows of the house when you get tired, open the doors and breathe in the wind passing through.
When we are in touch with these five elements that are being built by the body, our body has a new energy and a new energy.
We've experienced all this, but we don't care, it doesn't shut the cord in a trunk.
Now, when you come in contact with nature, you must be sure that there is no new catastrophe inside you.
Therefore, the global initiative to connect with the nature of June 5 should be the initiative of each one of us.
We are enjoying the quality of awaiting our ancient environment.
If we look forward to the environment, it will benefit the future generations.
Besides the Arthavemeda, this is the greatest guidance of the environment and remember that it was created thousands of years ago.
Mother Bhoomi, the tribe is called Prithvian.
In the Vedas, it is said that the humility of ours is because of our land.
The earth is our mother, we're children.
In our country, many festivals and many rituals are related to the environment.
Be it educated, non-educated, urbanized, rural people or tribal communities, the love for nature is a part of social life.
We have to describe it as new words, and describe new laws.
Some magnificent news from the states are playing.
In most of the states, as soon as the rainy season begins, there is a big initiative in terms of trees.
Crores of trees are planting.
School children, social organisations, government organisations and governments.
This time, we have to encourage trees and contribute to them.
June 21 is coming and June 21 is a special day all over the world.
This day is celebrated as World Yoga Day.
In a short span of time, the fame of June 21 Yoga Day has reached every corner of the world and connects people to each other.
On the one hand, many elements in the world are deformed, while India is making a big contribution to the world.
Through Yoga, the world has been able to switch on a trail.
Today, as the body connects mind, mind and soul, Yoga connects the world itself.
Two days ago, I wrote a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world about Yoga.
Last year, I have announced some competitions related to Yoga and some awards have been announced.
Some steps have been taken slowly in this regard.
I got some suggestions about this and I congratulate those who sent these suggestions.
I've got a very funny curse.
Grandpa, grandmother, grandmother, grandmother, parents, mother, sons and daughters, together with three generations, do yoga and apply their pictures.
This meeting of today and tomorrow will be an opportunity to give a new dimension to Yoga.
Yesterday, this film will be a picture of tomorrow, and it will be a pleasant promise of tomorrow.
I invite you all.
There are still about three weeks to be World Yoga Day.
This is a kind of healthcare scheme.
I invite anyone to be part of it.
When you took me the responsibility of being the chief servant, I got the opportunity to talk to the Red Fort in Delhi for the first time on August 15 and I talked about cleanliness.
Since then, I have been visiting different parts of India.
Some people do what Modi's doing, where's Modi going
I am grateful to him for seeing this thing.
If you hear this phone call, you'll understand.
Prayer Modiji, I'm talking to Naina from Mumbai.
Modi ji, wherever you go, I look regularly on TV and collective television that people pay special attention to cleanliness.
People have collectively adopted cleanliness as a mission in Mumbai or Surat.
Not only in the elderly but also in the children, there has been awakening about cleanliness.
Children who blame the filthy people on the road are rotten everywhere.
The media also gives great importance to it and I went to Kutch in Gujarat a few days ago.
It is a matter of great pleasure that cleanliness is related to my journey too.
There may be a habit of making all the rest of the preparations to welcome the Prime Minister, but now cleanliness will be a big thing.
It's a pleasure and inspiration for everyone who wants cleanliness.
When Modi ji decides his journey, ask those who invite me, what level will cleanliness be at the place where he invites me
How many tons of mattresses will dedicate you to me and I'll decide whether to come or not.
The idea is very good, but I have to think.
Instead of giving gifts, it has to be an enterprise to say that it will create more than 200 slabs.
How many people can be saved from the disease.
What a great humanitarian thing
Look at the wealth of these slopes as waste, look at it as a resource.
It's not just a waste.
If we start seeing these mattresses as wealth then new ways of waste management will come forward.
Youth associated with start-ups will come up with new schemes and new tools.
With the help of the State Governments, the Government of India has decided to start a big initiative in terms of waste-building energy with the help of people's representatives in cities.
On 5th June, the World Environment Day will provide conservative storage for collection of waste and waste in nearly 4,000 cities in the country.
There are two types of furnaces, one green and another blue.
The waste of kitchen, the skin of green vegetables, the food items, eggs and leaves are liquid wastes and they should be kept in green plants.
All these are beneficial in the fields of agriculture and reminds of what it is to do in the greenery .
The second is to include unnecessary papers, iron ore, glasses, clothes, plastics, polythenes, broken dubbers, rubber items, etc. in a way.
Versova Residents Volunteers took over the responsibility.
Brothers and sisters, Today it is a matter of great pleasure to tell you that the Reasi Block in Jammu and Kashmir has been a free defecation free area related to Swachh Bharat.
I congratulate all the people of Riyasi Block and the rulers there.
I congratulate the mothers and sisters there.
My dear countrymen, for the last fifteen days, in the newspapers, in the TV channels, in the social media, the present government has been counting everywhere.
Three years ago, you took me the responsibility of being the chief servant.
Several surveys have been conducted and a lot of opinions have been held.
I see all this as a very healthy thing.
This three-year activity has been changed in every way.
People from all sections of the society analyzed this.
This is a very good way of democracy.
The governments should be responsible in democracy and the government should give the people the account of their functioning.
I thank those who have discovered different and great ideas.
The active evolution strengthens democracy.
This analysis is very important for a nation awakening.
My dear countrymen, I am also an ordinary citizen like you and as a common citizen, the impact of good and bad service can be affected by any ordinary citizen.
As I said, as an ordinary citizen, the impact of my mind is important.
Two days ago, Honble President ji, Honble Vice President ji, Honble Prime Minister, Honble Speaker ji and others released a study book on Mann Ki Baat, as a person, this event is very exciting as a citizen.
He was grateful to the President, to the Vice President and to the President of India, to give importance to Mann Ki Baat, who was in such a high position and gave importance to him.
In a way, Mann Ki Baat gave a new dimension.
Some friends also discussed me during the work of Manki Bath.
He said that he wants to prepare a sketch on all the topics that had spoken in Mann Ki Baat, and Akbar gave a art form to Mann Ki Baat to show his love without buying a rupee.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahib.
My dear countrymen, the next time when Mann Ki Baat comes, the rains will come all over the country, the climate changes, the results of the examinations will come, the new study life will start... when the rain comes, there will be a new dryness, fragrance and fragrance.
In this environment, we can move forward by expressing love for nature.
My best wishes to you all.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at Akashwani via Akashwani, at 11 a.m. on 30th April 2017.
Namaskar to my dear countrymen.
The zeal of the children, the aspirations of the youth, the experience of the elderly and the experience of the elderly...
Commonly, it's advisory to others. It's the nature of people.
On the train, when someone coughs on the bus, the next person says, do it, do it.
It's our nature to advise, suggest.
At first, when suggestions were received about Mann Ki Baat, the voice of advice was heard and something was found to learn.
But when we tried to minutely analyze it, it was really nervous.
Most of those who say this, and those who try to get to me are actually doing something.
They work in accordance with their intellect, strength, capability and environment to do good.
When I noticed this, I thought these suggestions were extraordinary.
Last time in Mann Ki Baat, I was sorry to waste food.
This is an example of how things are going on in collaboration with society.
Today is the end of the month of April, the last day.
May 1 is the founding day of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Nature itself has changed all the rules of sports.
The warmth in our country in May-June has to be felt this time in March.
While accepting initiatives from people for Mann Ki Baat, many have sent suggestions about what to do during this summer.
Everything is prevalent, not new, but repeating it at the right time will be very beneficial.
Many friends starting Kartik are worried about birds.
They said it was to keep water in the balcony and terrace.
Small children in the family are very enthusiastic.
Once they take care of why they have to keep water, they're putting the utensils, they're gonna go ten times a day.
Keep in mind whether the birds are coming.
We think it's a game, but it's really a good experience of awakening an earthquake in the minds of the children.
He lived up to 103 years.
On the occasion of his 100th birth anniversary, Bohra Samaj has taken a big initiative to save the bruises through the Burhani Foundation.
I got the opportunity to start it.
They distributed around 50,000 diamonds to the world.
The Guinness Book of World Records got the place.
Sometimes the journalists, milkmans, vegetables, post-mans, etc. have forgotten to ask if we want summer and water when they come home.
Young friends, I want to tell you some things.
Many of our younger generations are happy to live in a very pleasant situation.
Parents are very safely enriching them.
But I would like to tell you how your holidays would be.
New places, new experiences, new capabilities...
Sometimes watch some things on TV, or read in the book, or listen to the experiencers... and feel the same thing yourself.
Experiments should be solid, you should get out of the cool breeze.
If we are from the middle class family, we are from the happy family.
You can't see the joy of sports in life ever before.
Have you thought that when children living in the society get the opportunity to play with you then how big change will be there in their lives.
This experience will teach you many things.
Go to the forests.
Sometimes summers will be organized, personality development pillars will take place...
Several development issues will be taken up.
Everyone will be busy with technology in their world.
Social life is a culture, it is a power.
Another thing I said is about skill, you don't want to learn something new.
Today is the time of competitions.
It will be hard to buy the highest number of markets and some coaching classes will go on vacations and the next test will be in danger.
But keep in mind whether the inner humanity is incomplete, whether it is away from human properties.
Can we focus a little more on skill development
You have to spend some time with yourself from technology.
Learn some musical instruments, learn 5-50 words of a new language, whether it is Telugu, Assamese, Bengali, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi.
Try to learn something you don't know, you'll have some advantage.
New places, new towns, new villages...
But wherever you go, look like a gyjasu, understand, talk to the people, ask them... it's a different pleasure to see them there.
Try and decide the place yourself.
Don't lose time for too much travel.
You want to spend three-four days in one place.
Then go to another place and stay there for three to four days.
It can learn a lot of things.
Share the pictures where you're going.
Share your experiences using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Indian government has given you a good opportunity.
The new generation has almost been freed from the outlook.
They don't need money.
They are starting to believe in digital transactions.
Did you think you could do this to make money
There is a scheme of the Government of India.
Bheem App you're downloaded.
Ten rupees will be invested from the government to your account.
One day, if you mix 20 people, you can earn 200 rupees by evening.
Businessmen and students can be earned through this.
The project is up to 14th October.
You have played an important role in building a Digital India.
You will be a guardian of New India.
Holidays and monetary opportunities.
Introduce yourself to digitally.
Our country usually has an atmosphere of hatred with the VIP culture.
However, now I have realized that it is so deep that the government has decided that no matter how big a person is in the country, the red light will not move on the vehicle.
In a way, it became a symbol of VIP culture.
It is learned from the experience that the red light was in the vehicle, but it has been accomplished in the minds of the people and intellectually a VIP culture.
Now the red light has gone, so no one can claim that the red light on the head has gone.
I got a very funny phone call.
People realize that they're afraid of the red light.
The government wants to talk about the prohibition of the Red Beacon Light.
I read in the newspaper, every Indian is a VIP in the line.
I feel so proud.
Thank you for that.
When it is called EPI instead of VIP, it means Everi Person's Is Important, everybody has the importance.
Let's work together.
My dear countrymen, I always want to recall our history, our culture and our traditions.
It will give us energy, inspiration.
This year, we are celebrating the 1000th birth anniversary of Ramanujacharya.
We've been finished in other things to remember for the most centuries.
The centenary may be very important for other countries in the world.
The people who were considered untouched by their own ways and behaviour.
Thousands of years ago, he asked them to enter the temple and successfully entered the temple.
How lucky have we been born in our society to free the evils of our society from all ages.
On the occasion of Ramanujacharyas 10th birth anniversary, we can inspire to awaken the idea of strength in organizing social unity.
The Government of India will release a stamp on 1st May to remind Swami Ramanujacharya.
He salutes Swami Ramanujacharya with respect and dedicates tributes.
My dear countrymen, there is another significance on May 1 tomorrow.
Very few people must know that we are contributing to Baba Saheb for the benefits and respect received by the workers today.
The contributions of Baba Saheb to the welfare of the workers are memorable.
Today, when we talk about Baba Saheb and Ramanujacharya, we remember the great Karnataka saint and social reformer Jagat Guru Basaveshwar of the 12th century.
Yesterday, I got the opportunity to attend a function.
I got the opportunity to release his speeches.
In the twelfth century, he was deeply contemplating about his teachings and teachings in Kannada.
In Kannada, he said, Kaya Kave Kailas.
This means that through your hard work you can reach Kailas, the grandeur of Lord Shiva.
I mean, you can get heaven by doing work.
I'm often supposed to win.
On the importance of jobs, the dignity of labour speaks of Dattopant Thangdi ji, the founder and thinker of the Indian Mussoorie group, I often remember.
Today, it is natural to remember Dattopant Thangdi while talking about labourers.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will celebrate Buddhism.
People from all over the world associated with Lord Buddha will celebrate it.
In India, Ashoka's life is an excellent example of the journey from war to Buddha.
I am fortunate to observe the United Nations Vesak Day in this great festival of Buddha Purnima.
This time it's going on in Sri Lanka.
On this auspicious occasion, I will have the opportunity to pay homage to Buddha in Sri Lanka.
He will get an opportunity to renew his memories.
Dear countrymen, efforts have been made to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' (Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas) in India.
Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas is not only in India but also in the global context.
Especially for our neighbouring countries.
India South Asia Satellite Launch will be launched on May 5.
The capacity of the satellite and its related facilities will help in fulfilling the economic and developmental priorities of South Asia.
It will be helpful in formulating a framework of natural wealth, in the field of tele-medies, in the field of education, in the matter of deeper connectivity of technology, in the matter of people-to-people contacts.
This is an important step in India to enhance cooperation with the entire South Asia.
An invaluable gift.
This is a great example of our commitment to South Asia.
March 26 is Bangladeshs Independence Day.
A historic battle against injustice and a wonderful victory for the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh.
Today, on this great day, I extend my best wishes to the brothers and sisters of Bangladesh on Independence Day.
Rabindranath Tagore - his memories are traditional for us.
Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore also created the national song of Bangladesh.
An interesting thing about Gurudev Tagore was not only the first Asian to receive the Nobel Prize in 1913, but also the British gave him the status of Nighthood.
However, in 1919, Rabindranath Tagore was a group of great men who were killed by the British in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.
It was the event that had deeply influenced the mind of a child at the age of 12.
The child who was laughing at fields and sports in his childhood gave a new inspiration to the brutal massacre of Jallianwala Bagh.
The 12-year-old child, who was in 1919, is the inspiration of all of us and our beloved, martyr Bhagat Singh.
On March 23, the British weighed Bhagat Singh and his friend Sukhdev and Rajguru.
We know that even at the time of death, there was no joy in serving Bharatamba on the faces of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
All the dreams of life were dedicated to the freedom of India.
These three heroes inspire all of us even today.
We cannot describe the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
As the British empire, these three were afraid.
The British had the idea of what they were about.
That's why they killed those who were determined to weigh on March 24.
They did it unusually without anyone knowing.
Then they brought their body to Punjab today and the British burnt fire without any knowledge.
A few years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I felt like a specific emergence on the earth.
I will definitely tell the youngsters of the country that if you get the opportunity, you will definitely go to the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh's mother and Badukeshwar Dutt.
Freedom, its intensity, its propaganda was a growing period.
On one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for the armed revolution.
In the freedom struggle of India, Gandhiji's thinking and his style were seen in Champaran.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and went to a small village in Bihar in 1917 and inspired the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Satyagraha of Champaran on the basis of the form of Mahatma Gandhi in our minds.
A man, who came back to Hindustan in 1915... just two years...
It was just a beginning.
We can imagine how much he would have suffered at that time and how much he would have worked.
Champaran Satyagraha was an opportunity to recognise Mahatma Gandhi's organisational capabilities and the ability to know the people of the country.
Mahatma Gandhi through his behaviour organised the poorest of the poor and the illiterate people in front of the British empire to fight, motivate and fight...
This wonderful power is that Champaran Satyagraha shows us, through which we recognise the glory of Mahatma Gandhi.
However, if we talk about Mahatma Gandhi a hundred years ago, then Champaran Satyagraha is a big study for any person who starts a public life.
This is the very foundation of a New India that will change the wishes of 150 crore people to change.
New India is not a government imagination, but a democracy party's performance.
New India is the call of 125 crore people.
This is the imagination of how we want to build a magnificent India together with 150 crore people.
There is an idea, a spirit, a imagination, an aspiration among the hundred and fifty crore people.
They're doing it like a quiet servant, like a penance.
There are many people who go to hospitals and help patients.
As soon as you know, there are many running for blood donation.
If someone's hungry, there's somebody who thinks about giving them food.
Let's say our country is Bahuratna Vasundhara.
The imagination of the service of the people is in our veins.
If we look at it with social consciousness, how much power will be formed if we look at it.
When you talk about New India, you should think about it, analyze it and look at it through a different vision.
If 250 crore people are determined, the dream of 150 crore people of New India will be fulfilled in our sight by taking steps one after the other.
Through this budget, the government does not want to take the money through schemes.
If we decide to pursue the transport laws, if every citizen decides that my duty will be fulfilled with utmost responsibilities, if every citizen cannot use petrol or diesel a day a week...
These are small things and you will be able to see the dream of this New India in this country of 250 crore people.
This means that every citizen should follow his citizenship and duties.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you.
Over the past few months, people in our country have been participating in the Digital Revolution of Digital Payment and are insisting on how to transfer money without money.
Even the poorest of the poor are trying to learn this, and gradually people are moving towards transactions without currency.
After the cancellation of notice, various types of digital payments have been made.
It's just two and a half months since the launch of BHIM App, but more than one and a half million people have downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
25 billion people, if they wish, don't wait for a year.
It's only for six months.
We can do this in a day-to-day life.
It is a great service to the country that you cannot imagine and you will be the brave soldiers of the fight against black money and corruption.
Digidhan Melas have been organized to teach people and to create awareness among the people.
100 programmes will be organized across the country.
80-85 programmes have been conducted.
There were prize schemes.
Approximately 12 lakh people have received gifts to consumers.
Seventy thousand people received gifts to traders.
Everyone is determined to move forward with this method.
14th April, 2018.
The Digidhan Mela is scheduled to end on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb on 14th April.
It's a big event to complete a hundred days.
There's an arrangement for mega hatred.
We can inspire BHIM App on the remaining days of Baba Saheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
Please play a vital role in reducing the payment of money.
My dear countrymen, I am glad to get different kinds of opinions from people of Mann Ki Baat every time, but the need for cleanliness is increasing every time.
Greetings to the Honble Prime Minister, the first time I congratulate you for winning this election with great majority.
I want to tell you my motherfucker.
I want to tell you how much people need to understand cleanliness.
I'm passing through a river every day, in which people put a lot of slabs, polluting the river.
Brothers and sisters, look at a child studying in class 11th, how much pain is that the river gets dirty.
The child's got angry with the snakes on that river.
I see this as a good symptom.
Since the commencement of the Swachhta Abhiyan, there has been a new awakening in the country.
The hatred of waste is also increasing.
Be it awake, be it a vibrant partnership, be it a people, it has its own importance.
I want to tell all those who listen to my Manki Bath Gayatri that the message of Gayatri is to be a message to all of us.
Everything you see fills in the plate, you can't eat the whole thing.
It's not a matter of telling anyone.
In our homes, when mothers call children, they say, sons or daughters, take them all over.
Secondly, it is economically beneficial for the family to benefit a little from it.
It is a good thing to think for the society, but it is beneficial for the family.
I am not compulsory in this regard, but I urge you to be more awake.
I know the youngsters who do great things in this regard.
They've made a mobile app for this.
If you know this kind of diet somewhere, people call and eat that food and use it properly.
This effort is the youth of our country.
In all the states of India, we will see people like this somewhere.
We can inspire them not to eat their life and food.
As much as you can eat.
Look, it's the way to change.
Those who are aware about health always say - keep your stomach empty and keep the plate a little empty.
On April 7, when you talk about health, it is the World Health Day.
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) has been set up by the United Nations by 2030.
This time, the United Nations is focusing on depression on World Health Day on April 7.
We also know the word depression, but some people call it depression.
According to an estimate, more than 35 crore people in the world are suffering from depression.
The creation of a psychological environment begins to get rid of it.
The first mantra is to open it than to stop depression.
Tell friends, parents, brothers and teachers what your mindset is.
Sometimes loneliness, especially children living in the hostel, are more difficult.
Our country's natural nature is that we live together and grow together, a large family, each other's middle age, which reduces the possibility of depression.
Otherwise, all of you don't come out together, remember if I don't come and say I'm alone.
For those who can speak to him openly, make him an opportunity to sit with him.
Smile and inspire him to talk to him, bring him out if you're in trouble.
It's a good way.
Disease of depression becomes the cause of physical and mental disease .
As diabetes is the master of all kinds of diseases, depression frees all the ability to fight, fight and decide.
If you don't have to open your mind in front of yourself, then seek help from someone with a service-seeker.
Help me, share your sorrows.
If you try to understand the sadness of someone else, if you do with the passion of service, you will have a new self-confidence.
You can reduce the weight and disappointment of your mind if you are serving selflessly because someone is connected to others.
Yoga is also a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga helps in many ways to eradicate stress, to eradicate mental stress, to enjoy happiness.
21st June is International Day of Yoga.
Last day, the central government had taken a big decision.
The number of women working in our country is increasing day by day and we should welcome that their participation is increasing.
The responsibility of the family and the financial responsibilities of the household have to be shared, all these are the reasons why the newborns have to work injustice.
Therefore, the central government has taken a big decision.
India has taken such a big decision for our sisters.
Dear countrymen, April 5 is the holy day of Ramnavami, on April 9th is Mahavir Jayanti, on April 14th is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
May the lives of these great men inspire us, let us inspire ourselves to pledge for a New India.
Two days later, Chaitra Skill Statue, Year Edition and New Year are coming and many congratulations to all of you on this new year.
This is the beginning of cultivation after spring and it is the time for the farmers to get the results of their hard work.
In different parts of our country, this New Year is celebrated in different ways.
The New Year is being celebrated in the name of Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Andhra and Karnataka as New Year, Ugadi, Chedi-Chand for Sindhis, Navreh in Kashmir, Sanvatsar Pooja in Awadh region, Jud-Sheedal in Mithila in Bihar and Satwani in Magadha.
India is such a diverse country.
My best wishes to you all on this New Year.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering at Akashwani via Akashwani, at 11.
After the leafying season, new leaves have started coming in the trees.
Flowers burst.
Gardens and gardens are green.
The color of birds starts attracting the heart.
Not only flowers, but also shining fruits are seen in the branches of trees.
The fruit of the summer mango flowers begin to appear in the spring itself.
Amir Khusro's skins have been very funny about the changing moments.
Amir Khusro writes: Fool Rahi Sarasom Sakal Ban, Ambava Phute, Tesu Fulekoil Bole, Dar-Dar, when the skins are enjoyed, when the skins are enjoyed.
Vasant Panchami, Mahashivaratri, Holi Festival etc. enhance happiness in human life.
Writing on the Shokha Jalan Narendra Modi App, many people do not know the achievements of ISRO.
So, they say, the launch of 104 satellites and the information about the interceptor missile.
Shokhaji reminds me of India's proud achievement.
Technologies and science have shown its role in fighting poverty, escaping diseases, connecting the world, gaining knowledge.
February 2017 is a day of pride for India.
Our scientists have created an opportunity to raise India's heads in front of the world.
We all know that ISRO has successfully completed several unprecedented missions in the past years.
After the success of reaching Mangalyaan on Mars, ISRO has established a world record in Shunikash on the last day.
ISRO has successfully launched 104 satellites from different countries such as USA, Israel, Kazakhstan, Netherlands, Switzerland, UK and India.
Together, India is the first country in the world to achieve history by bringing 104 satellites to the environment.
It is a matter of great happiness that PSLV has been successfully launched for the 38th time.
This is not only the ISRO but also the history of India.
The cost-effective and efficient environment mission of ISRO is surprising all over the world.
The world has commended the success of the scientists of India with an open heart.
Brothers and sisters, one of these 104 satellites is the greatest.
We've got some pictures as soon as our satellite arrived there.
It's starting its work.
It is a matter of great pleasure that our young scientists and women scientists have led the entire leadership of this mission.
The role of the youth and women is an important part of the success of the ISRO.
I convey my best wishes to the scientists of ISRO for the people of the country.
For the common man, their goal of bringing environmental science to the service of the nation has also been fulfilled, and everyday, new towers are pushing in their crown.
India has successfully tested the Balistic Interceptor Missile in the security sector.
It will be a pleasure to know that only four or five countries of the world have achieved this achievement.
Scientists of India have shown this.
The achievement of this is that even though India's targeting missile is 2,000 kilometers away, the missile is destroying it in the space itself.
Looking at new technologies, we feel happy to see new sciences.
Jesus has played a big role in human development journey.
Efforts are going on to know the creation of the Brahmins and the human minds.
New science and new technologies are born from it.
All the technologies and all the new forms of science are giving birth to a new era.
My dear youngsters, we are talking about the hard work of science and scientists and I have often said in Mann Ki Baat that our younger generation should enhance the innovation towards science.
The country needs a lot of scientists.
Today, scientists are becoming a cause for a new change in the future generations of ages.
Mahatma Gandhi used to say, "No science broke down from the sky in a bright form.
All sciences have been developed and built on experiences.
Pujaya Bapu further said, "I inspire the spirit, teaching and dedication of modern scientists who have led them in search of truth.
Scientific explores how to utilize the principles of the common man by aiming at the needs of the common man, what should be the medium, what should be the technology, because it is considered to be the most important contribution to the common man.
Identifying, displaying such inventions, informing people, innovations, how to benefit the common man, how to make more productive and how to be commercially used.
Sometimes problems show the importance of science to find peace.
All arrangements are being made technologies.
In a way, technology turns into an excellent one of our lives.
Digi-Dhan Yojana was very important in the past.
In particular, the younger generation is habitual to do digital payments through their mobile phones.
I see this as a good news.
Our country has received a lot of support in the last few days for Lakhi Grahak Yojana and Digi Dhan Business Yojana.
For nearly two months, 10,000 per day will be awarded.
Through these two schemes, the launch of Digital Payments in India has been accepted all over the country.
Under this scheme, more than one lakh consumers have been given a prize of Rs.
More than 4,000 traders received awards of Rs. 50,000.
Farmers, traders, small businessmen, other employers, Grihanaths and students are enthusiastically participating and benefitting them.
Asked if only youngsters come, or adults come, he said that among the awardees, there are 15 years old and 65-70 years old.
Shri Anandji of Mysore was happy to write on the Narendra Modi App and he received a thousand rupees as per the Lakhi Grahak Yojana.
Then I thought they were worth a thousand rupees I had... and I gave them that thousand rupees.
I am glad that Anand ji, your name and your work gives us happiness.
You have done an inspirational work for everyone.
In Maharashtra, a young friend, Pooja Nemade Post Graduate is a student and shared his experience of how happy he feels to use the Rupee Card e-Valata in the family and remember how valuable he is.
On completion of 100 days, the Lucky Grahak Yojana is Rs. 14.
Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth anniversary.
On 14th April, a huge award for crores of rupees is going to be ruthless.
Forty-five days left.
Can you remember Baba Saheb Ambedkar
Baba Saheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary is over.
Remembering him, you should also teach at least 125 people to download BHIM App.
Teach us how money is being driven, especially the small businessmen nearby.
This time, on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, give special importance to BHIM App.
Go home and join everyone and bring BHIM App to 125 crore hands.
In the last two-three months, this movement has achieved great success in many townships, in many villages and many cities.
The farmers of our country have produced foodgrains to improve the record this year.
All indicators that our farmers have improved the past records.
It seemed as if the famine and Vaishakhi are being celebrated today after seeing the crops in agriculture.
This year, more than two and a half lakh tonnes of foodgrains were produced in the country.
My country's farmers have heard the voices of the poor and about 290 lakh hectares have been cultivated in different cultivations.
The government is constantly trying.
Last day, a function of senior officers from 23 states was held in Telangana under the leadership of Secretary, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Government of India.
We can see wealth from waste.
It's a proven thing.
If there is a standard doubling toilet for a six-member family, it is filled for nearly six years.
After that the waste can be left back to the second ditch.
In six to twelve months, the waste of the dust is completely decomposed.
It's very safe to handle such waste and as a cultivation, NPK is a very important cultivation.
The farmers know the NPK cultivation well.
Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium are very nutritious, which is considered a very good farm in the field of agriculture.
As the government has taken this step, others will have taken such steps.
At the government level, various departments are regularly observing Swachhta Diwara.
In the first dual of March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development is going to strengthen the Swachhta Abhiyan in collaboration with the Ministry of Tribal Development.
In the second round of March, the two Ministries, Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, together with the Ministry of Water Resources, are leading the Swachhta Abhiyan.
We all know that if any citizen of our country does what is good, then he will be proud that the whole country has reached a new height and confidence will increase.
I once again congratulate all the team sportspersons.
The country is proud of the achievements of these Divyang friends.
Brothers and sisters of Divine Disabilities are talented, determined, courageous and emotional.
We're gonna get to learn something from them.
Whether it is sports or environmental science, women in our country are not behind anyone.
We are moving together and making the name of the country bright by achieving achievements.
In the last few days, our women won a silver medal in the Asian Ragbi Sevens Trophy.
My best wishes to those players.
World Women's Day is being celebrated on March 8.
Today, it's not just the government programme.
The thinking of the people about the old traditions that have been going on for years has changed.
It's a pleasure to hear the news that the girl was born as a celebration.
In a way, positive thinking with girls has become a cause for social recognition.
It was learned that child marriages were stopped in Gudalur district of Tamil Nadu through a particular population movement.
So far, about 175 child marriages have been stopped.
The district administration has opened bank accounts for more than 50,000 girls under the Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana.
As per the Convergence Model in Katwa district of Jammu Kashmir, all sections are linked to the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, along with organising the Gram Sabhas, the district administration has been making a lot of efforts to donate orphan girls and ensuring their education.
In Madhya Pradesh, a mass movement is being organized for girls' education in every village and every household.
Rajasthan, our children, our school, Apana Bacha Apana Vidyalaya, has implemented a scheme to inspire the girls who have been trained in the middle of the school to re-integrate and study.
Finally, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme has taken several forms.
This is a good symptom.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
On the one hand, when our country enjoys rainy season, on the other hand, there are some kind of festivals or fairs in every corner of India.
It's like this till Diwali.
Perhaps, our ancestors have demonstrated a cycle, economic level and a form of social life, so that there is no constraint in the society in any environment.
We have celebrated several festivals in the past.
Everyone can find solutions to today's problems from Sri Krishna's life.
Despite all these significances take the work of Sarathi in the battleground .
Sometimes pick up the mountains, sometimes squeeze the leaves eaten .
I mean, it feels a new thing in all the things of Krishna.
So today when I talk to you, I pay attention to the two fascinators.
One is the charming one of the sightseeing chakras Mohan and the other is Church.
Mohanan, a Sudarshan Chakradhari, left the Yamuna coast and lived in Dwarka town in Gujarat and reached Delhi on the banks of Yamuna at the end of the sea.
We can learn from the message of Lord Krishna whether it is the importance of selfless service or the importance of knowledge or the significance of sniffing in all the topics of life.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
A new pillar has been set up by way of human life.
Services, service mood and duties towards service were always part of Mahatma Gandhis life.
In his life, an example has been taken forward through the path of service.
Mahatma Gandhi had individuals, society, humanity and humanity.
He also emphasized the importance of social integration everywhere in the Phoenix Family of Africa, in the Tolstoy Family, in the Sabarmati Ashram, in the Wardha.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit several great places related to revered Mahatma Gandhi.
I can tell you that Gandhi had given importance to organisational understanding with the passion of service.
We have to bring the feelings of social service, social development and social organisation to our practical life.
In the true sense, this is the tribute to Mahatma Gandhi and the actual Kayakanjali.
There will be a lot of opportunities like this, and we will increase together.
But what's Gandhi 150
As a person, what can be the part of these efforts
Think of the value addition itself.
There's a ladies club.
Let us continue to work in the Ladies Club of modern times, but all members of the Ladies Club should do something together.
You can do a lot of things.
Opening old books, distributing to the poor, distributing information.
130 crore people will have 130 crore ideas and 130 crore initiatives will be launched.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
During the freedom struggle, the salt sacrifice in Dandi was a great path.
In Dandi, I inaugurated a state-of-the-art museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.
I urge you to travel to any place related to Mahatma Gandhi in the coming days.
It can be anywhere - Porbandar, Sabarmati Ashram, Champaran, Wardha Ashram, Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi.
When you go to such a place, you must share your pictures in the social media and inspire others.
This time, Venice Binale's Indian pavilion showcased immense interest in the memory of Gandhiji.
The Haripura panels were specially attractive.
You will remember that the congressional conference was held in Haripura in Gujarat and the event that was chosen as the President of Subhash Chandra Bose was recorded in history.
These art exhibitions have a very beautiful past.
Before the Haripura Conference of the Congress, Mahatma Gandhi had invited the then Principal Nandlal Bose at Shantiniketan Kala Bhawan in 1937-38.
Gandhiji wanted to showcase the lifestyle of the people of India and showcase their artefacts at the Mahasama Mela.
With this artistic constitution, Nandlal Bose was also immersed.
Nandlal Bose visited villages near Haripura and finally some of the pictures showcasing the lives of rural India.
These valuable artefacts were discussed in Venice.
Once again, on the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I urge all Indians to take a pledge.
For the country, for the society and for others, something has to be done.
This will be the best, real, meaningful calculation of Bapu's creation.
My dear children of Mother India, in the last few years, we have organized a programme of filth free service across the country for nearly two weeks before October 2.
This time it will start on 11th September.
Plastics should be given special importance this time.
On 15th August, I reminded you of how much enthusiasm and zeal the people of the Red Fort had organized a mass movement for waste generation and worked towards evacuating the defecation.
Similarly, we have to stop the use of single-use plastics alone.
There is great enthusiasm for all sections of the society in this regard.
My brothers and sisters in the field of business have put a board in front of the shop and write that those who come to buy goods should bring a bag.
This will also leverage the money, and will enable them to play their role in protecting the environment.
This time on October 2, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Baba, we will not only dedicate to him a free defecation free India but will also lay the foundation stone of a new gathering against plastic all over the country.
We'll make it fuel.
What is greater inspiration than Gandhiji
Dear countrymen, our culture-speaking languages are in a way knowledgeable.
We'll get what we need in our life.
I would like to say a big thing through a cultured language.
It's a matter written centuries ago but it's very important even today.
Prithvivya Trini Ratnani Jal Man, Subhastamui, Pashankhandeshu Ratna Sanjha, is a very well-known journal in the earth, there are three journals like water, food and subhasita.
The foolish people call stones a gem.
Anna had great importance in our culture.
We've made the knowledge of Anna even science.
Awareness about the need for nutrition is transforming the country through modern scientific methods.
People fight against malnutrition through new and attractive methods.
Under this scheme, the servants of the Anganwadis collect each grocery from the people on crop seasons.
This grain is used for making hot food for children and women.
After that, the person becomes himself dedicated to this goal and becomes a soldier of that tribe.
All of us must have heard about a function called Annaprasham in all parts of India.
This is being done for the first time to give rice to children.
It's not a liquid, it's a thick meal.
People donate food at various places.
On the occasion of birth day, spinach or memorial day in the family, the people of the family make nutritious food, good tasty food and take them to anganwadi or school, which gives their children their own asset.
They share their happiness and share each other.
It is a good coordination of service passion and happiness.
Friends, There are many small things like this that there is a successful fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of information about nutrition, the poor and the rich are suffering due to lack of nutrition.
The month of September will be celebrated as a nutritious month throughout the country.
You must be part of this, add new programmes and share your role in it.
It means that if you can save someone from malnutrition, then we will save the country from malnutrition.
Everything I went last week, wherever I saw people, Man vs.
However, I have never thought that there will be an opportunity to touch the minds of the youth around the world.
What's happening
He went to Bhutan last week.
Since I have got the opportunity to go as the Prime Minister since then, because of the celebration of International Day of Yoga, somebody asks me something about Yoga from those who have got the opportunity to sit near.
This is my experience all over the world, not a big leader who did not discuss with me about Yoga.
The Discovery Channel is planning to address 165 countries in its language.
I am confident that this episod of Discovery Channel will help in introducing the world about environment, global warming and climate change, the message of India, the heritage of India and the cultural journey of India.
Today people want to know about the steps taken for climate conservation and a clean environment in our country.
Have you been shooting several times
I'm sorry to ask you.
Look, there's no secret in it.
I'll open myself because there's a question in the mind of many.
Or it's not a secret.
It is true that technology has been efficiently used in interaction with Bir Grills.
Whatever I say, the speech was going on in English and he was listening to a small instrument that had no abdomen in the ears of Beer Gliss.
I mean, I was speaking in Hindi, but he was listening to English, so it was easy to talk, that's a wonderful technological display.
After this show, many spoke to me about Jim Corbett National Park.
You must go to places related to nature and wildlife.
I have said this before and again, I want to go to the north-east of India.
I want to spend some time there.
My dear countrymen, the thought and concern of the environment in India, that is, the thought of protecting nature is naturally visible.
Last month, I got the opportunity to release Tiger Senses in the country.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, it was only half of it.
In the matter of tigers, a Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg in Russia in 2010.
He expressed his concern over the decreasing number of tigers in the world and decided that it was a day.
It was decided to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
However, this is a New India and we are achieving the goals at a fast pace.
We have doubled the number of tigers in 2019.
The number of tigers in India has not only doubled the number of protected areas and community reserves.
The Gir forest took several steps one after another.
In 2007, he decided to appoint women guards there.
Infrastructure has been enhanced to promote tourism.
When we talk about nature and wildlife, we talk about protection.
We have to think of sympathy beyond protection.
In our scientific sciences, there will be very good advice in this regard.
Listen to our scientific sciences centuries ago, Nirvano Vadhyate Vyagro, Nirvadhe Vyagro, Save the jungle, Save the jungle wilderness, the jungle wilderness, that is, if there is no forest, the tigers are forced to come to human beings and are killed.
My dear countrymen, who can forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on 11 September 1893.
The Indian Youth Saint, who has captured human race all over the world, has established India's bright personality in the world.
On 11 September 1893, the words of the great man like Swami Vivekananda were bound to change the vision of India.
Come, let us try to live with the real power of India that Swami Vivekananda had seen, the form of India that Swami Vivekananda had seen.
But I'm not crossing the details.
Wait till August 29.
To get rid of plastics, we will work with all our strength at home and everywhere.
I am confident that this movement will be full of social evils.
Come, with a new zeal, with a new determination, we can move with a new energy.
We can proceed by expressing the joy inside with a serving passion.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today interacted with the people of India, on the eve of 21st January, 2017.
My dear countrymen, we are greetings to everyone.
On January 26, our Republic Day, everyone celebrated with happiness and enthusiasm in all parts of the country.
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy, this is a cultural festival that makes the future generation aware of democracy and democratic responsibilities and culture.
However, however, no matter how deep and detailed discussions are going on in our country regarding the duties of the citizens and the rights of the citizens.
Within two minutes, there is a social vision and determination and respect for the martyrs.
In our country, everybody has a natural respect for the forces and the security forces.
On the eve of Republic Day, I congratulate the brave soldiers and their families honoured by various brave awards.
The awards include Kirti Chakra, Shaurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal and Vishisht Seva Medal.
Could you do one thing to me, particularly to the youth, who is very enthusiastic about social media
On the one hand, when we are happy to hear the 26th anniversary of joy and enthusiasm, the brave soldiers of our armed forces from the security of the country came to Kashmir.
I pay homage to all those brave men and salute them.
My young friends, you are very well aware that I regularly express my mind through the Mann Ki Baat programme.
The months of January, February, March and April are the period of examinations in every family.
When I came to know about this issue, many teachers, parents and students made me read, asked questions, suggestions, pain and reference to suffering.
I would like to share the thoughts of my mind after seeing all this.
I got a telephone message from a child called Creation.
Listen, the creation says, "I don't want to tell you that there is a terrible atmosphere in our houses, neighbors and society at the time of the exam.
This is the reason why the children are relieved instead of getting encouragement.
Those who enjoy the exam are very few.
It is an opportunity to examine most people.
That's what happens in ourselves, that's what comes out.
It feels that there is strength on the occasion of festivals in the society.
It's the best.
At the time of exams, there will be an excitement atmosphere between the entire family and friends and neighbours.
Pressure, you'll see the change in the plaster, the pressure will be joyous.
Festival will make the mind weightless.
Look, it'll change.
From Kanyakumari to Kashmir, from Kutch to Kamarup, from Amreli to Arunachal Pradesh, exams are conducted in these three-four months.
You must understand that the power to call memories is the most peaceful mind.
If you're tense, all the doors are closed, it doesn't come inside, it doesn't come out.
There is an obstacle to the thought process, which becomes a weight like that.
I say from my experience, if there is mental pressure, we forget, if there is peace, then we cannot imagine, it will be very beneficial.
No matter what you don't know, it's not the problem that you didn't learn to study.
However, when there is mental pressure, your knowledge, knowledge and learning are suppressed and your mental pressure undermines all this.
It looks like death is a problem.
You're going to write the exam is a year-long study test.
P.
J.
If he was disappointed because of this failure, if he had failed his life, he would have been able to get such a great scientific scientific scientific person or would have got such a great President.
Therefore, the competition has grown, and there is also an increase in mental pressure among the students.
Mark and Mark sheets are very limited.
It's not all in life.
Life goes ahead depends on how much knowledge you've got.
If you believe in these things, the Mark Wall will be followed by you, and you will never need to follow the Mark.
You will be able to benefit from knowledge in life, benefit from skills, self-confidence and benefit from determination.
Look at his experience, knowledge and success.
That's why the market's weight prevents us from going on the right path.
But if you concentrate on the market, you will gradually limit you to certain things, only to make the way.
This is a very psychological fight.
In fact, the competition is not useful to lead a life, and it is necessary to compete with oneself to move forward in life.
How's the day to come better than the last day
How's the chance to come better than what happened
Sometimes you've seen it in sports and there's a quick understanding, so I'll tell you the example here.
The characteristic of their lives is that they compete themselves in the case of most winners.
You didn't feel sleepy because of the exam tension, did you sleep now
Second you're worse than him.
Third, equal.
Just keep in mind how to do better than what was done before.
Beautiful parents have expressed their views on the role.
He said the role of parents in the field of examination is very important.
Because mothers are more aware of the future of children at home, they are simplifying many things.
If you learn to accept, more problems will end there.
That's why I want to tell the parents that you sometimes do this to the children.
Do you think you want to give children an interview of laughter on the days of the exam
Look, the atmosphere will change.
A very funny phone call came.
Because I worked like that in my childhood, and I tried to complicate once in my childhood.
I made a lot of preparations for that.
I tried to find ways, and I lost a lot of time.
"You're right.
Sometimes when you don't believe in your own ability, I'll tell you that I'll look at the next person.
Perhaps we'll write it right, and the next person's writing is wrong.
We're gonna find it wrong and we're gonna lose their own dust.
I mean, you don't have much to do with the copper.
It's a liar, so don't do it.
The fucking shit makes you evil, so don't worry.
What is the Prime Minister, what is the Prime Minister asking the children to play at the time of the exam, I will be angry.
Because it is generally believed that students are careless about learning in sports.
This is wrong.
This is the basis of problems.
If you want inclusive development, there is a life outside the books, it is very large.
It's time to learn to live.
It's time to form life.
It's called the maintenance.
In my vision of exams, there are three things in my vision, right rest, second sleep for the body, third intellectual activity and a large part of the body.
Therefore, the rest of the body needs an opportunity to work.
Have you ever thought of seeing the sky, seeing plants and trees while sitting in front of me
Long breath sends a lot of stress.
There is no need to be firm in the room to breathe long.
Some guys think they'll be sitting late in the night and learn more.
You must sleep for the body.
So you don't lose time to learn.
A native guy who came to see me about it asked, how many hours do you sleep
I asked you again, brother, are you a doctor
He said that while addressing the election, your speech is related to sleep.
If you sleep enough, you'll get enough rest for your walkal code.
He gave me a big medicine that didn't think of sleep and vocal code and my voice.
It doesn't mean just sleeping.
So don't do that.
If possible, don't...
Otherwise, it's a weight, and I'm gonna advise your family parents not to be weighted.
Remembering your determinations, believing in your ability and examining.
My best wishes.
Make the exams a festival to win all the exams.
And the test will not be exams.
Go ahead with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, the Indian Coast Guard is completing 40 years on 1st February, 2017.
On this occasion, I express my gratitude to all the Coast Guard officers and jawans for their service to the nation.
The Coast Guard has secured 126 ships and 62 aircraft manufactured in our country as the fourth largest coastal force in the world.
The Coast Guard jawans stand in the opposite environment to protect the maritime and coastal environment of the country by making this ideal true.
Last year, the Coast Guard jawans have taken a major goal of cleaning the coastal coast of our country with their responsibility.
Thousands of people took part in it.
It is a matter of commendable that they have thought of coastal security as well as sea sweeping.
Very few people must know that not only men and women are successfully responsible for the Coast Guard of our country.
Our women officers in the Coast Guard are not only pilots and officers, but also handle the control of Hovercraft.
Today, maritime security is a very important topic in the world, therefore, the Indian Coast Guard conveys hundreds of greetings to those who have been involved in the great work of Indias maritime security.
Basant Panchami Festival is held on 1st February.
The spring is considered to be the best tower.
The spring is known as the king of skins.
Vasant Panchami is a festival of Saraswati Puja in our country.
It is believed to be an opportunity to worship scholarship.
Not only this, it is a celebration of inspiration for the brave.
Mera Rang de Basanti Chola, this is an inspiration.
On the auspicious occasion of this spring Panchami, my greetings and best wishes to my countrymen.
My dear countrymen, the skies of Mann Ki Baat are giving new forms in their own way.
Since last month, my Mann Ki Baat has started listening to Mann Ki Baat in local languages.
I once again congratulate the Akashwani for their inspiration and congratulations to the countrymen.
It's a great opportunity to connect with you to Mann Ki Baat.
My best wishes.
Today is an opportunity to give importance to service, sacrifice and compassion in life.
Jesus Christ said, "It is not our benefit to the poor, we need our acceptance."
St. Luke specifically stated, 'Yesu has not only served the poor but also congratulated the poor.' This is the real empowerment.
A story related to this is very famous.
Because others gave a lot of money, but that widow gave them everything, today December 25.
Two days ago, I got the opportunity to launch several development works in Malaviyaji's destination Banaras.
I laid the foundation stone of Mahamana Madan Mohana Malviya Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi.
The Cancer Care Centre built there will be very beneficial for not only the Eastern Uttar Pradesh but also for the people of Jharkhand Bihar.
Today, our former Prime Minister Bharat Ratna is the birthday of Honble Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
This country will never forget the contributions of Atal ji.
Under his leadership, we also gave the country a glory in terms of mighty power.
Atal ji had established great ideals as a party leader and as a Lok Sabha minister and as Prime Minister.
On the birth anniversary of Atal ji, I bow to him and pray to God for his health.
As an activist, I got the opportunity to work with Atal ji.
Several memories are showing their eyes.
I have shared an old video when I was here this morning and I can see how I had the privilege of being a young worker in the love year of Atal ji.
Today, in the day of Christmas, the people of the country are going to get the benefit of two schemes as Christmas gift.
In a way, the second phase of November has been started.
There is an atmosphere of ambition all around the country, whether it is a village or a city or academic or illiterate, how to make cashless payments and how to buy goods without money.
Everyone wants to learn and learn each other.
In order to promote this, to strengthen mobile banking and to become e-payment habits, the Government of India is initiating incentives for consumers and small businesses today.
This is not only for a day but also for 100 days from today.
Everyday, 10,000 people get a thousand rupees per day.
For hundreds of days, lakhs of families are going to be given a gift of crores of rupees and you are entitled to cheating by using digital payment methods like mobile banking, e-banking, rupe cards, UPI and FSD.
Digi-Dhan Business Scheme is mainly aimed at traders.
This scheme is aimed at all sections of the society, particularly the poor and the lower sections of the middle class.
Therefore, those who buy less than Rs. 50 and less than Rs. 3000 will get such a gift.
Those who buy goods for more than Rs. 3,000 will not get this gift.
Very poor people will be able to buy goods, sell goods, load money, so that they can all be beneficiaries of this scheme.
These 30 crore people will soon be part of the presentation scheme.
If you ask them all the youngsters will know these things, I know that they will tell them all and there will be children who have learned 10 or 12 in your own family and they will tell them very well.
It's simple as you're sending Watts App messages through mobile phones.
My dear countrymen, how to use technology, how to make e-payment, how to make online payments, information is expanding rapidly in the country.
In the last few days, cashless business has increased by 200-300 times.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this.
The business community is very well guessed how big this decision is.
Digital trading trading entrepreneurs give a discount to income tax when they promote online payment system instead of notice in their business.
The Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri.
Someone said that the Assam Government had decided to discount 10 per cent if the goods tax and license fees were closed digitally.
If the branches of rural banks are conducting at least two digital transactions between January and March, with 75 of their transactions, then the government receives a gift of Rs. 50,000.
As on 31st March, 2017, 100 Digital Transaction Villages have been announced to be awarded Rs. 5 lakh as per the Government's 5th For Digital Transaction Scheme.
They also announced the Digital Agricultural Shiromani Scheme for the farmers, according to which the first 10 farmers who have been making digital payments to buy seeds and yields will be given Rs.
Congratulating the Assam Government in this regard, I congratulate all the governments for such initiatives.
Various organisations have adopted various successful methods to promote digital transactions among the poor farmers in the villages.
Someone said that GNFC-Gujarat Narmadawali Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited (GNFC) has set up thousands of POS machines in the field of fertilizer sales centers, and within a few days, 5 lakh chocolate cultivation has been given to 30,000 farmers through digital payments.
The most interesting thing is that GNFC's cultivation has increased by 27 over the previous year.
A country like India should be at the forefront of this region.
Our youth has made a lot of progress in start-ups.
This digital movement is a golden opportunity.
With new ideas and new technologies, new technologies, new technologies, our youth should give great importance to this region.
So, we can become a partner in the campaign to eradicate the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I'm asking people at Mann Ki Baat every month to share your opinions and tell you what to say.
In MyGov and Narendra Modi App this time, 80-90 percent of the thousands of opinions were about to withdraw the fight against corruption and black money, and when I saw it all, I felt that the mischief could be totally three times.
Some have explained in detail about the problems and inconveniences faced by people.
Another companion wrote that it is so good that for the good of the country, however, however, however, however, however, however, however, however, the new ways of belief are found.
I am grateful to the people for helping me write so many letters.
The emotions of Guru Mani Kewal are emerging in every corner of the country.
We all recognize it.
When people suffer, who is a person who doesn't have any pain in it when they are suffering
I feel the same pain as you do.
I clearly know that if 250 crore people stand together, nothing is impossible, people are the image of God and the blessings of the people are the blessings of God.
I express my gratitude to the people and salute the people for taking part in this great campaign against corruption and black money.
The law is the same for everyone.
Whether it is a person or an organization or a political party, everybody has to follow the rules and must follow it.
Those who cannot directly support corruption and black money have been trying all the time to find the lack of government.
This government is for the common people.
They are constantly trying to know the opinions of the people.
People see what problems are, what is the cause of the law, what is the problem and what is the solution.
As an ever-sensitive government, how many laws are required to be changed by considering the well-being of the people, the objective is to reduce the problems of the people.
On the other hand, I said it was an extraordinary fight, on the eighth day.
For 70 years, how many powers have been united in black money transactions with faith and corruption.
How much is their strength
When they are determined to fight such people, they are adopting new methods every day to defeat the government.
When they follow new methods, the government has to adopt new methods to defeat those methods.
You're gonna give me ten times - because I'm gonna make corrupt people, thieves, free black money.
On the other hand, there were letters from others who gave information about what kind of thieves are being carried out and how new methods are found.
In this regard, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my dear countrymen.
The number of information available in the government system is manifold from the common man.
It's usually a success, that's because the common people are awake.
Can anyone imagine how dangerous the awakening people of my country are challenging to illuminate such evil powers
The third gathering to write the letter is very different, they say that Modiji, don't weaken, don't wait, how hard the footwear can be, the external situation should go a long way.
I would like to specially thank those who wrote such a letter because they have faith in their letters and blessings.
I took it out and made a strong 'Benami Economy Act'.
In the coming days, the law will start doing its job.
For the sake of the nation, whatever it is to do for the sake of birth is preferred.
My dear countrymen, I have said in Mann Ki Baat last year that our farmers have improved the record of agriculture in the midst of these difficulties.
It is a good news about the agriculture sector.
Last day, India has been proud of the World Economic Survey in many fields and as a result of the continuous hard work of our people, India's growing vision in the global rankings through different indicators.
India's ranking in World Banks Doing Business Report has risen.
As per the Global Investment Report released by Dutch, India ranked third in the Top Prospective Host Economies for 2016-18.
India has jumped 32 ranks in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
We have moved 16 places in the Global Innovation Index 2016 and the World Banks Logistics Performance Index has increased 19 ranks in 2016.
While reviewing other reports, this is the same way that India is progressing at a fast pace.
But the mind is very happy to see some good things happening in this situation.
The government is committed to the people with disabilities.
I personally tried to speed up this movement.
My aim was to empower people with disabilities and to achieve dignity.
When we won four medals in Parallimpics, our divine brothers and sisters have strengthened our efforts and faith.
They not only enhanced the pride of the country through that victory but also wondered the people by showing their talent.
Our divine brothers and sisters are an invaluable wealth and strength like all the citizens of the country.
I am very happy that after passing this law for the welfare of the people with disabilities, there will be an increase in employment opportunities for the Disabilities.
Government has increased the coverage of reservation in jobs to 4.
Through this Act, specific departments have been created in respect of education, other facilities and grievances of Divyangjan.
It can be estimated from the fact that how sensitivity the government is keeping in mind the Divyangjans, the government has organised 4,350 tombs in the last two years and has distributed equipments to 5,800 brothers and sisters with disabilities at a cost of Rs.
The Government has passed the new legislation in accordance with the wishes of the United Nations.
Earlier Divyanagar was of seven types.
Talsemia, Parkinson and Kultatha have also joined this gathering.
Over the past few weeks, the news from the sports was proud of us.
It is natural for us to feel proud as Indians.
The Indian Cricket Team has won four priests against England.
Some of these young sportspersons were commendable.
The test captain Virat Kohli gave a good batting and a good leadership.
The Indian Cricket Team's offspinner bowler R.
The Junior Hockey team took the World Cup.
After fifteen years, Junior Hockey team wins the World Cup.
Congratulations to the younger sportspersons for this achievement.
This achievement is a good wish for the Indian Hockey Team.
Our women were surprised last month.
India's women hockey team also won the Asian Champions Trophy, and now, a few days ago, India's women hockey team won the bronze medal in the Under-18 Asia Ship.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the players of cricket and hockey teams.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
We were celebrating Diwali in the last month.
Some wrote poems, some came to the pictures, some came to the cartoons, some made video.
I mean, how many houses have turned into military posts.
I'm surprising to see how emotional and visionary I still see these letters.
With all your partnership, the book is prepared by giving you your ideas about the country's army and your vision to the security forces.
A young man wrote to me, Prime Minister ji, we will take all the festivals like Holi and Diwali on the border.
Every minute, we can be finished in the thinking of the security of the nation.
However, the festivals will remind of the house.
But it doesn't happen this time, if you tell the truth.
It's a celebration, there's no idea of not at home.
It was a pleasure that we also celebrated Diwali with 250 crore Indians.
When the entire nation stands with the soldiers, the strength of the army increases by 125 crore.
A few days ago all the princes of the villages of Jammu and Kashmir came to see.
They were the people of the Jammu-Kashmir Panchayat Conference.
There were about 40-50 people from every village in the Kashmir Valley.
I got a chance to talk to them for a while.
However, when the dialogue progressed, the situation in the valley, the law and the future of the children was quite natural.
I am very happy to note that all the villagers who came from the Valley of Kashmir have fulfilled their words.
They went to the village and awakened the far-flung people.
A few days ago, when the Board exam was conducted, about 95 percent of the children of Kashmir participated in the examination.
As many children participated in the Board Examination, our children in Jammu and Kashmir are determined to scale new heights of development through education for a bright future.
Addressing the nation at 8 pm on 8th November, he said that an important step is being taken to bring about changes in the country.
The more important thing it should be implemented, the more important it should be, and I felt that there would be a lot of problems in our normal life.
I said that it will take 50 days to come out of the impact of this decision and it will be as big as possible to return to the normal level after this 50 days.
A large country of 500 and 1000, millions of currency, millions of people and this decision is being taken care of by the world and all the financial experts are assessing and assessing it.
25 billion people of India are looking to achieve success by enduring difficulties.
There can be a question mark in front of the world.
It is an integral reverence to 250 crore people of India.
There is a strong belief that this decision will be successful and our country will prove to be transformed like gold.
That's why you're the citizens of this place, you're the ones, and you're the ones who can go through this path of success.
Rapakal has been engaged in this thing, the central government, the state governments, all the components of the local local bodies, one lakh thirty thousand bank branches, lakhs of bankers, more than one lakh post offices and more than one lakh bank friends.
In the midst of a variety of psychological conflicts, all of them are very peaceful and considered it as a national service and are working as an attempt to make a great change.
Starting in the morning, it's working without knowing when the night is over.
In such a situation, the officers of the bank and the post office work.
When the matter of humanity comes, they look two times ahead.
An accident occurred in Khandwa
Suddenly there was a need for money
I was very happy to learn that when he was in the eyes of an officer of the bank, he himself went to the house of the elderly and provided the money for treatment.
Innumerable stories like this are known everyday by television, media, media and media and others.
They are trying to save black money by packing the poor and stimulating them in their accounts or by doing something else.
But please don't play with the lives of the poor.
He said, Sir Namaste, my name is Ashish Pare.
From Tirali village in Taluk, Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
This will enhance the people, and the economy is very important for nation-building.
I'm with the country in this regard.
I am very happy to note that the following steps of the five and a thousand people.
I would like to thank you for your heart because nobody thought you would take such a big step when you said that Daddy Ayenge.
After 500 and 1000 people, they taught black people and corrupt people a good lesson.
Every Indian will not have a good day.
People from different countries of the world have learnt to say that tea-pay discussion.
But I didn't know that there would be a marriage in the Chai Pe Church.
On November 17, I got to know that there was a marriage with Chai Pe Church in Surat.
In Surat, Gujarat, a girl gave tea to all those who came to her marriage.
There was no procession, no food programmes, because the money was slightly difficult due to the withdrawal of the money.
People find the best ways in a problem.
People are finding their ways.
You see this change.
The big people with relations, who don't want to ask them, they don't pay them properly and their remuneration will be very much left.
All municipalities were 50 percent of their lives.
But this time, due to this decision on the eighth day, all of them ran off to shut down their old books.
During the last year, over 47 cities, Rs. 3,000 crore had been sanctioned.
You will be surprised and happy to hear this, and this week we got a slaughter of Rs. 15,000 crore.
There will be many examples like this.
Brothers and sisters, our villages and our farmers are strong in the economy of this country.
On the one hand, due to this new change in the economic system, every citizen is fighting it in the midst of difficulties.
Under the Mudra Yojana, there is a significant progress in providing loans to them.
MUDRA Yojana has provided lakhs of crores of rupees to small people like this because millions of people are doing these small businesses and pace the business of crores of rupees.
But it was natural for them to have trouble under this decision.
But now our small businessmen are using technology, through mobile apps, through mobile banking and through credit cards, they are serving consumers and businesses are being carried out on the basis of faith.
I would like to tell these small businessmen that you too have the opportunity to enter the digital world.
You also download the bank's app on the mobile phone.
You also put POS machines to use the credit card.
I invite you for that.
I am confident that this technologies can be implemented in the entire business of your village.
Don't let anybody steal you.
I know you, the young men of my country liked my decision.
I know you're supporting this decision.
I know that you have played a very important role in taking this thing forward in an effective manner.
Friends, you're my real soldier, my good friends.
This is a wonderful opportunity to serve Maternity India. It is an opportunity to take the country to economic heights.
My young men, can you help me
Your family doesn't know the gentlemen, the parents, the father-in-law, the mother-in-law.
You know what the app is, you know what online banking is, you know how online ticket booking is.
It's a simple thing for you, you're using it.
However, today the country wants to do a great thing as a society without notice.
It's really possible that a hundred percent of the unnoticed society is not possible.
But can't we turn into a slightly useful society
Once you start building a short-term society, the unnoticed society will not be removed.
You know how many opportunities are available to a non-visual society, digital banking or mobile banking today.
All banks are providing online facilities.
All banks in India have mobile apps.
Every bank has its own voluntary.
Volate means e-persons.
Several types of cards are available.
As part of Jan Dhan Yojana, millions of poor families of India have RuPay cards.
The use of Rupee Cards in a very small quantity has increased by 300 times after the eighth date.
Like a prepaid card on mobile phones, a prepaid card is available to spend money from the bank.
Not only this, the technology is becoming simple without any need for this big smart phone.
I have focused on making these arrangements more easier.
Every bank is trying to do it.
My young friends, it's all but a great generation that doesn't know.
I know you're all working on this great thing.
I see the creative messages you have given on the Watts App - printings, poems, short stories, cartoons, new ideas, sports joys.
But my dear young friends, I tell you again, I need your help in this matter.
Your mobile phone will have all the technologies to spend online.
Not only this, everyday, half an hour, one hour, two hours and less than ten families have to use this technology, how to download the bank's app, how to spend the money in your own account and how to give it to the creditor.
The poor will bless you once you teach people how to use the RuPay card.
If you teach ordinary people all this, they might get rid of all the grievances.
I don't think that if all the youth of India come up in this regard, it will take more time.
Within a month, we can introduce a new India to the world.
You can do this through your mobile phone, you can go to 10 houses every day, you can connect 10 houses every day.
I invite you, come, not just support, but we can be the soldier of this change, we can rest with the change.
We will take this war to eradicate corruption and black money from the country.
The country has made a revolution.
My dear youth, I once again urge you to take this initiative forward.
I urge all schools, colleges and universities, NCCs and NSS to do this together.
Let's take it forward.
We have got the opportunity to serve well for the country.
You shouldn't lose this chance.
You must have seen that the most renowned artist of this century, Amitabh Swachhta Abhiyan, is leading very heartfelt.
Cleanliness seems to be spread over his molecule and that is why he remembered the birth anniversary of his father and his sanitation.
He wrote a verse of a poem of Harivansh Rai ji, "Man body, a joyful mind, a blessed life, that's me.
Cleanliness drives in the nerves of his son Shri Amitabh ji.
He has written to me through the poem of Harivansh Raiji - Swachh Bharat, Swachh Mann, Swachh Bharat, that's me.
I respectfully bow to Harivansh Rai ji.
Thank you very much.
Deepawali is celebrated with enthusiasm and joy in every corner of India.
India is a nation that celebrates any festival in any corner of the country on 365 days.
We have seen the courage to conclude untimely festivals.
The changes in festivals are naturally adopted as per the requirements of time and society.
Do it through festivals.
All these things were linked to our ancestors in a very scientific manner.
Today we are discussing the environment all over the world.
Whether it is trees or plants or rivers or animals or mountains or birds, there were festivals responsible for all.
That is, in our country, the tradition of celebrating vacations and brahmins and sciences was created.
Today, when we celebrate Diwali, our festival will also be intelligent and intelligent.
The Deepawali Tamaso Ma Jyotirgamya gives a message to go from darkness to light.
Every part of the house cleanses the weight.
This habit and tradition should be slightly widespread and expanded.
Deepawali is no longer confined to the border of India.
In every country of the world, Diwali is reminded and celebrated in another way.
Several governments of the world, parliamentarians and rulers of the world have been part of Diwali celebrations.
Whether eastern countries or western countries, developing countries or Africa or Ireland, there will be a celebration of Deepawali in America.
Canada's Prime Minister Deepawali has been shown in a film titled Deepawali.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, in London, joined all the communities and organized a ceremonial ceremony and participated.
What's in that picture
The Prime Minister of Australia has called upon the people of different cities of Australia to participate in the Diwali celebrations along with the best wishes of the Indian community.
Last day, the Prime Minister of New ealand came.
He said he had to return there soon to attend the Diwali celebrations.
It reflects that this festival of light has become an inspiration for bringing the world community from darkness to light.
The parents and the parents should be asked to stay closer when the children burst, the elderly should stay closer, without observing any obstacles, to avoid the danger by apprehension.
In our country, the festival of Diwali continues to be a bit longer.
Chhath Puja festival is a big festival in the eastern parts of India.
Whether I talk about Diwali or talk about Chhath Puja, it is a real opportunity to congratulate you all.
But it is also an opportunity to express gratitude to the people of the country.
Our soldiers have dedicated themselves to peace and peace because of the events that took place in the last few months.
When we all celebrate Diwali, our soldiers are suffering from all kinds of problems, some in the desert, some in the Himalayas peak, some in the Himalayas, some individuals, some wait for airports.
How many responsibilities are they
In words, birds, wings, colors, innumerable feelings...
I can imagine how proud the soldiers of my country are.
I am glad that you're sweet to say this is the truth that because of my freedom and the gift of happiness, I sleep peacefully because I sleep peacefully because you, the mountains and the Ambara and the gardens of India salute you, like that, I salute you as well as I salute you.
My dear countrymen, the house of their parents and the house of their husband, a younger sister Shivani gave me a telephone message.
Come on, let's hear what the military family says.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I am talking to Shivaniman.
The launch of this Deepawali Message to Jawan programme provides a lot of encouragement to our soldiers.
I'm from a military family.
My husband is also an army officer.
My father and husband's father were officers in the army.
I mean, my family is full of soldiers.
A good message is being received by the Border Officers and everybody in the Army Circle is encouraging.
Their families and their wives have sacrificed a lot along with the Army Officers and Soluciers.
In a way, there is a good message for the soldiers and I congratulate you on Diwali.
My dear countrymen, we will see the soldiers standing not only in the border but in all areas of life.
Whether it is natural calamities, the law and order, the enemies, the daring to bring back the wrongdoing youth... our soldiers are working in every field of life with national will.
First Sikkim, now Himachal Pradesh and Kerala will be like this on November 1.
The name of his village is Badhana.
He came there and was discussing the construction of toilets.
Some families have not seen toilets being constructed due to financial problems.
The Swachhta Abhiyan was strengthened by providing a thousand rupees to 57 families from their pockets.
This has enabled Himachal Pradesh to become Open Defect Free.
In the far-flung jungles of Kerala, there is no way of wolves but only a tribal village that can reach hard for the whole day.
People don't go there.
Cadets and others from the National Service Scheme and engineering students all together decided to make themselves toilets there.
Things are moving at a rapid pace in all the states.
Something I've just taken.
I compliment the citizens of these states for their role in eliminating the blindness of the country as part of this great thing.
My dear countrymen, the government's plans are very much and after the first scheme, one such scheme will have to leave the first project.
However, nobody has taken care of these things.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi has shown us all the way.
You decide according to this criteria.
We have to face the awakened expectations of the poor of the country now that is the need of the hour.
Now there are girls and toilets in schools and boys have toilets.
It is no longer possible for 20th century to become dark in the village.
Therefore, the programme to provide electricity to the village to get rid of the darkness is progressing successfully.
The effort is to provide smoke free life to 5 crore families and is moving towards success.
Small businessmen, small businessmen, vegetable traders, milk sellers and fertilizers were being caught by robbers.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account etc. are successful programmes to evacuate robbers.
Direct money will be invested to Aadhar Lute Bank and direct money will be provided to the subscribers
This is an opportunity for the common man to get rid of the middle class.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow 31st October is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the great men of this country who lived and lived in the unity of India.
On one hand October 31 is the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the birth anniversary of the vibrant great men of unity of the country.
I think he has succeeded in it and he has joined everyone together.
On the same day, the death of Indira Gandhi was done and we can say that the fate of the country is harmful or unfortunate.
On the birth anniversary of the great man who lived throughout his life for unity, on the birth anniversary of Sardar, the cruelty of Sardars and one of historians presents us pain.
Stay away from the thoughts of different people and the actions of different people and wait for the country and it.
Sardar Saheb's lifestyle started in a fight for the farmers.
He was the son of the farmer.
Sardar Saheb had a great and important role in making the freedom struggle a farmers.
Nowadays we're listening to the name Atul.
Even today, people from outside India are aware of all the products of the origin, but the Union of Cooperative Milk Producers has thought of Sardar Saheb's divine vision.
He gave importance to this idea in 1942.
And how it was, it appears to us directly in the form of Atal, a well-being and prosperous state of the farmers.
I salute Sardar Saheb with respect.
On this Ekta Diwas, on 31st October, we should remember Sardar Saheb anywhere and understand the concept of unity.
My dear countrymen, Kartika Purnima is a glimpse of this festival of Diwali and it is a light festival.
The knowledge and advice given by Guru Nanakdev is not only guided by Hindustan but also the entire humanity.
The message of Guru Nanak Dev was service, honesty and good for everyone.
Guru Nanak Dev Bhai Lalo was his colleague when there were disorders of touch, caste and supremacy.
If we want to move with the mantra of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, then we will have a better way than Guru Nanak Dev.
I bow to Guru Nanak Dev on the occasion of this light festival.
My dear countrymen, once again in the name of the soldiers of the country, on the occasion of Diwali, many best wishes to all of you.
May your dreams and concepts be fulfilled in every sense.
May your life be pleasant and peaceful.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the gathering on the occasion of Akashwani via Akashwani, at 11.
My dear countrymen, you all are greeted.
We lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir in the past.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
This loss was lost by sons, brothers lost, not only those families lost their husbands.
My dear countrymen, we believe in our army.
We're proud of our army.
There is a lot of opportunities for traditional and political leaders to speak.
Every parent wants all schools and colleges to be televised.
They want their crops and fruits to reach all the markets across India.
That is, the economic business also wants to do well.
Over the past few days, business has started to take place.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path of peace for our problems, the path of our progress and the path of development.
For our future generation, we have to give new heights of Visakhapatnam.
I am sure we will find peace together for all the problems and will guide the future generations of Kashmir.
The security of the traditions of Kashmir is the responsibility of the administration.
The administration will have to take some steps to implement the law and order.
I would like to tell the security forces that the use of our powers and legislations is for peace and comfortable life for the common people of Kashmir.
Sometimes those who think differently than what we think, keep new ideas.
I have got the opportunity to know a lot of things from social media in the near future.
From every corner of India, there is an opportunity to understand and understand the emotions of people from every corner of the country, which gives a boost to the strength of democracy.
Last day, a child named Harshvardhan of class 11 presented a different idea before me.
He wrote, I was sorry after the Uri terror attack, and I wanted to do something.
But I don't know what to do... what can a little guy do like me.
Yes, the child presented it with a creative vision.
But during the war in 1965, Lal Bahadur was a scientist who led us, when there was a zeal, zeal and patriotism all over the country.
Everybody wanted to do something, and thought of doing something.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji was very good to touch this emotional level of the country.
He gave the mantra of Jai Jawan-Jai Kisan and inspired the common man of the country to work for the nation.
Lal Bahadur Scientist showed that there would be other ways to show patriotism among the voices of bombs and guns.
Mahatma Gandhi, while leading the freedom struggle, used to adopt a very effective method of bringing the power back to creative things in the society when he felt a step towards the struggle.
Let us and the army perform their responsibility, let the rulers perform their duties, let our countrymen and every family play a creative role with the enthusiasm of this patriotism, then the country will certainly scale new heights.
Dear countrymen, Shri T.
Kartik Narendra Modi App has written to me and made history of the athletes who went to participate in the Paralympics, their performance is the success of human inspiration and human spirit.
Not only in you, but in all the countries, our sportspersons participated in the Paralympics have embraced an emotional relationship.
Perhaps, Para Olympics and the achievements of our sportspersons have changed the vision of humanity and the vision of Divyangjan.
I won't forget the words of our victorious sister Deepa Maliki.
When I won the medal, the sister said that through this medal I defeated the disability itself.
These words have a lot of power.
This time in Para Olympics, 19 latches including three women from our country participated.
Compared to other sports, the sports of Divyangjans is more efficient than physical talent and sports skills.
You will be surprised to know that our sportspersons have won four medals for the greatest achievement so far - two gold, one silver, one bronze and the second in the pole volt.
He was losing his hands because of electric cyclone.
You think that a man won the Gold Medal at the age of twenty-thirds and then at the age of thirty-thirds, how much he would have done if he had the second Gold medal.
Mariappan won the Golden Medal at Thankvellu Haijamp.
Tankavelu lost his right hand in the fifth year.
Poverty did not interrupt his vision.
He doesn't live in a big city, but a middle class family.
Whether it leads a life full of trouble or physical difficulties, he won a medal for the country through determination.
If it's Lat Deepamalik, it's rocked up various flags and won the sword.
Come on, C.
He won a bronze medal at Bhadi Haijamp.
It is also important to inspire us to look at the disabled brothers and sisters living in our country, in our society and in our neighbourhood.
We have to awaken our sympathy and change our vision for this Divyangjan and very few people know how much performance this time has been shown in the paralysis.
A few days ago, there were Olympics competitions in the same place.
Is there anybody thinking that even the public Olympics' records have cured the disabilities
This time it took place.
In the coming days, India is trying to create an ease of doing so for Para Olympics.
My dear countrymen, last week I had a wonderful experience in Navsari, Gujarat.
It was a very emotional moment for me.
I told the people who were there, people were surprised.
I got the opportunity to release a book in which the success stories of the lives of some Divyangjans were collected.
It was very exciting events.
I believe that setting up of world records on the soil of Navsari in India is very important.
Within eight hours, 600 people with disabilities have been able to access unable to hear machines.
It's got a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It means that the country has stepped towards cleanliness.
It was sure that the results were moving in the right direction and what was going on through a little effort.
Therefore, every common man, government or office or road or bus stand or railway or school or college or religion or hospital or from children to elderly, the poor villages and women all play their role in Swachhta.
Friends from the media also played a creative role.
In order to maintain health and respect for the males, especially the mothers and sisters, we should end the pledge that is performed in the open space.
Therefore, the Open Defence Free (ODF) has started a mass movement called Open Defecation Free (ODF).
Healthy competition is going on in villages in the districts and states.
States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala will be successful soon on the path of elimination from the habit of cleanliness.
Come on, let's move with determination.
I would like to introduce a scheme in front of young friends, especially those who use technologies in recent times.
Everyone has the right to know what is peace in your city in terms of cleanliness and the Indians have given a number to it - 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
In 1969, we celebrated the birth centenary of Mahatma Gandhi and in 2019, we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
If you call this number in 1969, you will not only be able to understand the situation in the construction of toilets but also apply for construction of toilets.
You're gonna get rid of it.
Moreover, a Swachhta App has been launched to know about the complaints related to cleanliness and the solution to those complaints.
You use this, especially the new generation.
The Indians have requested the corporate world to move forward.
Sponsor Youth Professionals who wish for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Fellows.
In today's era, health is linked to cleanliness and cleanliness is also essential for it.
Waste should be a part of the economy.
Therefore, we must turn to the West to Compost along with the Swachhta Mission.
Fertilizers have told companies that they should be prepared to buy composts from waste.
The Ministers, Chief Ministers, Mayors and Commissioners from all over the country are going to make very serious discussions about cleanliness.
What can you do with technology
How can it create jobs
There will be discussions on all these issues.
I see new news about cleanliness.
The next day, I was told in the newspaper that the students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started awakening for toilet construction.
They used their hard work capabilities to construct 3000 toilets and spread the message of Swachhta from Devprayag to Gangasagar in a team of Wing Commander Paramveer Singh.
Each department of India has prepared a timetable for a year.
I urge the Parents not to interact with their respective locations in the activities of these departments.
Currently, everything related to sanitation is going on.
Initially, a survey of 73 cities was conducted and the Swachhta level was presented to the people.
Now, 500 cities with a population of more than one lakh are fountain.
This time, we have been behind this time and the next time we will have a confidence in every city.
October 2 is the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It's been two years since the launch of Swachh Bharat Mission.
This will lead to the light of Diwali in the house of the poor and this time on October 2, Sunday.
You cannot participate in the removal of a filthy filthy filth, you should be a participant for 2 hours and 4 hours.
In the memory of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri, we will resolve to do something for the country.
From 2nd October to 8th October, 2018, the Prime Minister will commemorate the Joy of Giving Week in various cities.
It is a move to store food and clothing for the needy.
This is the centenary year of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay.
He has contributed to the universal welfare and Antyodaya theory.
Mahatma Gandhi was talking about the welfare of the last person.
How can the poorest of the poor get the benefits of development
Let us concentrate on how the benefits of development can be achieved by the poor.
It is a symbol of the year of poverty welfare and I respectfully salute Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay ji, rich in our ideological heritage and inspired all of us.
My dear countrymen, two years ago I started Mann Ki Baat on the occasion of Vijayadashmi.
I have tried my heartfeltly not to be a slaughtering programme of Mann Ki Baat.
This Mann Ki Baat should not be a programme of political career and transplantation.
How do the common man in this country inspire me
I mean, Mann Ki Baat is not a 15-20-minute dialogue, but a new opportunity for social transformation has increased.
Anyone else would be more pleasant than this.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today delivered the Malayalam address at Akashwani via Akashwani to the people of India at 11.
My dear countrymen, tomorrow is the birthday of Hockey Mantrikan Dhyanchand on 29th August.
He played an important role in winning Gold in Hockey for India in the Olympic Games in 1928 and 1932 and 1936.
All we love cricket, Bradman's name has been heard.
He told me about Dhyanchand that he is a high-score goals lines (He wins goals like winners).
Dhyan Chandji was a living example of sportsmanship and patriotism.
Once in Kolkata, a opponent was hit by a hockeyist on the head of Dhyan Chand.
So there was 10 minutes left to end the game.
Dhyanchand said that within ten minutes, three goals were shot and answered by goals.
My dear countrymen, whenever the time of Mann Ki Baat comes, there are many suggestions on the MyGov or the Narendra Modi App.
Diversity.
But this time everyone wants to say something about Rio Olympics.
I am very hopeful to see the ordinary citizens so close and so eager to the Olympics that the Prime Minister of the country wishes to say something about it.
There is so much affection and so much awareness among the citizens of India in terms of sports without cricket.
Our daughters have once again proved that they're not behind anyone.
It seems that girls from all over India have taken a mission to achieve India.
Shekhar Thakur wrote in MyGov that we could have done better than the Olympics.
He wrote, "Congratulations to Honble Modiser, for the first time in winning two medals in Rio.
But I would like to invite your attention to whether our performance is good.
Our parents still focus on studies and academic issues.
The society still considers sports to be lost time.
It's necessary to change this thinking.
The spirit of the society has to be increased.
Nobody can do this better than that.
We can't deny that we couldn't do a performance like we hoped.
In some cases, our sportspersons have performed well in India, but the best performance shown here has not been expected.
We got only two medals in the medal list.
But if you don't get medals, you can see that in many species we have shown a good performance.
You see, in shooting, our innovation Bindraji reached fourth place and lost his medal in a very small difference.
This is what happened in Tennys about Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopan.
We performed well in the athletics.
In 32 years after Usha, for the first time, the simple Babar Track and Field was qualified.
It is a matter of great pleasure to know that the women's hockey team came to Olympics after 36 years.
For the first time in the last 36 years, the male came to Hockey to the outstage.
Our team is very strong.
Many sportspersons like Aditi Ashok, Datu Bhokanal and Anu Das were good.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot of things.
But if it's done again, perhaps we'll be disappointed again.
We'll prepare a framework for how we can be better.
The project should be prepared with a long-range idea of 2020, 2024 and 2028.
The state governments and such committees should be formed and what we can do in the field of sports and what we can do for each state.
States have to choose one or two species of their power.
I also urge sports associations to take care of them indefinitely.
I urge every citizen of India to give me the opinion of the person who is interested in it.
We'll be fully prepared.
Dear countrymen, September 5 is a Teachers Day.
I have spent a lot of time with the students on Teachers Day for years and spent time like a student.
I learned a lot of things from small children.
For me, September 5 was Teachers Day and Teachers Day.
But this time I have to go to attend the G20 Summit, so I decided to express my feelings in Mankibat itself.
Teachers have the same place as their mother has in life.
I have seen teachers who are worried about more than their own.
They give life for their disciples, for their students.
Now, after the Rio Olympics, there is talk of Pulela Gopichand all around.
On Teachers Day, I salute Pulela Gopichand, his penance and his dedication to sports and his way of rejoicing in the success of his students.
We always feel the contribution of teachers in all our lives.
On September 5, the former President of India, Dr.
This is the birthday of Sarveda Radhakrishnan ji and the country is celebrating this day as Teachers Day.
I remember many stories of my teachers because teachers in our small village were our heroes.
Even today, he looks like teaching me in the classroom.
I'll tell you he's giving me a Crosspondence course even today.
It's wonderful that he's writing such beautiful letters in this age when he sees his handwriting in this thirteenth year.
I feel very honoured to see somebody's good letter because of my writings being bad.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival is coming closer.
Ganesh changes the evils of our country, of our society, of our family and of our everybody's life.
The Jan Ganesh Festival was started by Lokmanya Tilak, through which he made this religious festival a moment to awaken the nation.
Even today, Ganesh Festival is being organised not only in Maharashtra but also in every corner of India.
Every youngster is making a lot of preparations for this festival and will be very enthusiastic.
Some are still trying to follow the feelings of the world's leader.
Discussions on public issues, conducts articles, performs flowers festivals.
The topics that touch the society in its scenes are presented in a artistic manner.
In a way, the Ganesh Festival is a big initiative for public education.
Lokmanya Tilak Swaraj inspired us to be our birth rights.
But we live in a free India.
It is true that the festival is the strength of the society.
Festivals give a new life to the life of a person and a society.
Life is impossible without festivals, but it has to be shaped in time.
This time many wrote to me specially about the Ganesh festival and the worship of Durga.
You should use Ganesh ji made of soil in the pond of the village.
The idols made of the Plaster of Paris are not equivalent to the environment.
He and others are very painful.
I urge you to build statues of Ganesh and Durgadevi and return to our old tradition.
Ganesh is a stupid man.
That's why we shouldn't make Ganesh a fugitive.
I don't know how much you're gonna accept, but it's not just me, but many say it.
Several such institutions work very hard to build and propagate the soil of Ganesh.
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival is also a social service.
There is no serious harm to the environment due to the resolution of the river in the lake.
My best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna, Mother Teresa and Mother Teresa will be declared pure on 4th September.
Mother Teresa used the entire life to serve the poor in India.
It is natural for every Indian to feel proud that Mother Teresa, who has served the poor throughout his life, has got the status of pureness.
The Government of India is also presenting an official delegation under the leadership of our Foreign Minister Smt. Sushma Swaraj for 125 crore people in this festival on September 4.
We can learn something from the saints, sages, sages, munimers and great men.
We're getting something, we're learning, something's going on.
My dear countrymen, how many changes will take place when development is a mass movement.
Jan Shakti is considered another form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made successful efforts to connect the people to clean the Ganga with the help of five state governments.
A meeting of Village Chiefs on the banks of Ganga was called in Allahabad this month.
I convey my best wishes to the concerned Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India for this idea.
I express my gratitude to the Chief Ministers and the five states for the great step in consolidating and cleaning the Ganga.
My dear countrymen, some things sometimes touch my mind and people who have created these ideas have a special respect in my mind.
On July 15, more than one and a half lakh students from about 1700 schools in Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh wrote a letter to their parents together.
Some wrote in English, some wrote in Hindi, some wrote in Chhattisgarh.
They told their parents in the letter that toilet was required in their homes.
They said that some people wrote that this year didn't celebrate their birthday, but it was certain to make toilets.
This is what we inspire.
A sixteen-year-old girl in Kopal district of Karnataka, Malma, who made a swearing-in against her family.
The family was not financially capable.
The child was standing in the bed.
The Chief of the village, Mohammad Shafi, who was supposed to be satyagraha for toilets, organised an amount of Rs.
He also congratulated the girl Malma and the head of the village like Mohammad Shafi.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat is the dream of all Indians.
Some Indians are determined.
Some Indians have targeted it.
This information will be available in the web site.
The awards will be given to the winners on Gandhi Jayanti Day on 2nd October in this short film competition.
Tell me to tell TV channels that you should also call for films like this and compete.
The activity will strengthen the efficiency of waste, new milestones will be available, new methods will be learned, new inspirations will be found.
All this will be through the participation of people and ordinary artists, whether it is a big studio or a big camera to make films.
Some people may think that the President should inaugurate a radio channel.
But it's not a normal radio channel, it's a big step.
Bangladesh is in our neighbourhood.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal still stand with the same cultural heritage.
Here, Akashwani Maitri and Bangladesh Bethar will share their programmes and Bangladeshi speakers on both sides enjoy the activities of Akashwani.
Akashwani's contribution to creating individual relations is very big.
It was inaugurated by the President.
I thank Bangladesh for their cooperation with us in this regard.
I convey my best wishes to the skies for their participation in foreign countries.
My dear countrymen, you've given me the job of Prime Minister, but I'm a man like you.
Sometimes some emotional events touch my heart too much.
Such emotional events give new energy, inspiration and inspire the people of India to do something.
I salute the millions of mothers in India who have always been trying to help others with their sufferings.
My dear countrymen, we were suffering due to sorrow last year but this August was suffering due to continuous rains.
Some parts of the country have been flooded again.
State governments, central governments, local independents, social institutions and citizens have made a lot of effort to do whatever they can do.
But in the news of the flood, there were some other news, which had to be remembered.
The power of unity and how big a transformation can be achieved if we move together, the month of August this year will be remembered.
A total of 90 parties across the country, and all the parties in the Parliament, together, passed the GST Act.
Its credit is for all parties.
This is an example of how big things can be achieved if all parties go together in one direction.
Similarly, all the political parties of the country together spoke about the events in Kashmir and the situation there.
I believe in the strength of 250 crore people.
This morning, I had the opportunity to spend with some young people from Delhi.
I hope that in the coming days, all the youngsters of the country will be filled with the zeal of Olympics.
The whole world will be in the games.
In the coming days, we must do something to encourage our sportspersons anywhere.
I will definitely send messages to the sportspersons on the Narendra Modi App site.
Come, let us all together try to enhance the dignity and dignity of all our souls and appreciate their efforts.
On this occasion, while talking to you about Rio Olympics, a student from Punjab Centre University, Suraj Prakash, who is interested in poetry, can tell you a poem.
There will be many other poets like this, they will have written such poems, some will write again, some will have done musical works of poets.
I want to share with you the poem that Suraj had given me.
Mr. Angit Karke reminded me of the death anniversary of Vice President Abdul Kalam.
Therefore, Shri Angel has been inspired to write down what steps your government has taken to realise the dreams of Abdul Kalam.
The next century will be driven by technology.
If someone tries to hold it, then it will appear somewhere in new dresses, and if you want to add technology to it, then we must be able to move ahead.
Therefore, we can also adopt research and innovation as the priority of technology.
Innovation, experiment, entrepreneurship, etc. , there is also an increase in employment opportunities.
If we organise the second generation of innovation then our children will join it.
That is why the Indian government has started the Atal Tinkering Abs.
The programme will provide assistance of Rs. 10 lakhs to the schools which are part of the programme and Rs. 10 lakhs for implementation cost for the next five years.
Similarly, Implementation Centre is directly related to innovation.
In order to make ourselves sufficient incubation centres, we can create a systematic mechanism for start-ups to innovate.
Construction of new incubation centres and innovation of old people is essential.
We have to face many problems in our daily life.
If the disease comes, the mind wants to recover quickly, so some antibiotics are eaten.
You can get rid of it for a while, but without consulting the doctors, you have to stop taking such antibiotics.
We don't eat antibiotics as long as the doctor doesn't write.
We don't move through such fucking roads.
Years will pass through this war, new medicines and scientific research.
Until then, these diseases will continue to create new problems.
Therefore, we must always be aware of this.
Brother, take this antibiotic.
Eat 15 pills and the doctor will tell you to eat it in five days.
The course should be completed by eating pills on the same day as the doctor suggests.
By taking more medicines than required, it will be beneficial for the bacteria.
Therefore, how long do the doctor suggests the course of pills, it's a big thing to follow the same.
In medical language it is called antibiotic resistance.
Therefore, it is necessary to pursue laws to use antibiotics as well.
Our government is committed to protect antibiotic resistance.
You can see a red appearance on the skull of the place where the antibiotics are sold today.
I'm sorry you should take care of it.
I would like to add another thing on health issues.
I am worried about the lives of pregnant women in our country.
It is not said that during pregnancy and post-blood deficiency, reproductive infection and high blood pressure, what kind of problems are going to destroy their lives.
This is the reason why the Government of India has been implementing a new mission in the last few months i. e.
As part of this mission, all pregnant women are provided free check-up at Government Health Centres every month on the 19th of the month.
I urge the gynaecologists to say that this service cannot be provided free of cost for the poor mothers on one day a month i.e. 19th.
I'm sure you'll be part of it.
My dear friends, today the whole world is worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
Community discussions are going on in the country and the world.
India has been focusing on this for centuries.
On the battleground of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna is discussing trees.
Shukracharya has also said that there is no vegetation without medicinal medicinal properties.
The donor of the trees enjoys the tree as well as the world.
So, the parents who want their own good will plant good trees and protect them like foxes.
Whether it is Geeta, Shukracharya, or the goddess of Mahabharata, there are some who live in these ideals in the present generation.
A few days ago, I noticed a daughter in Pune, Sonal, for example.
It touched my mind.
The discipline of the Mahabharata says that the trees are fulfilling the responsibility of the people in the world and Sonal has taken an effort to fulfil the desires of not only his parents but also the society.
Kisan Ghandu, a village named Narayanpur in Kejunar Taluk, Pune, Maharashtra, married his daughter Son in a very inspiring manner.
I saw its picture in social media.
I didn't see the people of Varna's journal in marriage, but it was surprising to see only plants.
This scene that touches the mind was in the picture.
Sonal is an agricultural graduate and this idea is her own.
You will see how great nature has shown love by giving gifts to those who have come to the wedding.
In another way, Sonal's marriage has become an inseparable story of natural love and I congratulate Sonal and Shriman Mahatrija for this innovative effort.
This can be transformed into a natural generator of the tree bed.
The Government of Maharashtra has decided to plant around 1. 5 crore trees across the state on 1st July this year and 3 crore trees next year.
To plant 25 lakh plants in Rajasthan is not an indecisive thing.
Those who know about the soil of Rajasthan understand how hard it is.
Andhra Pradesh has also decided to increase its greenery by 50 by 2029.
Gujarat also has a bright tradition of the forest festival.
This year, several names like Gujarat Mao Forest, Ekta Forest and Martyr Forest have been provided to the Forest Festival and have been trying to plant millions of trees.
But for me, the trip to South Africa was a pilgrimage.
Remembering Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela in South Africa is natural.
When we hear words of non-violence, love and forgiveness in the world, it is the face of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to the Phoeni settlement and was known as Sarvodaya, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
I got the privilege of traveling from Peter Maritburg station on a train travelled by Mahatma Gandhi and this was the event that cooked the seeds of making a son of Mahatma Gandhi.
I would like to tell you that this time I have got the opportunity to meet many great personalities who have been honoured for equality and equal opportunities in our entire society.
They were living in jail for 20-22 years after fighting with Nelson Mandela.
I was fortunate to see the next friend of Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ahmad Katha, Mr. Laloo Chiba, Mr. George Besos and Rani Casirils.
Even after such a great penance, the feelings of gaining, singing and becoming in their faces could not be seen anywhere.
Responsibilities of duties - that is, the symptoms of the duties mentioned in the Gita - that is, I have seen them as a person.
Any society and government have no specimen of equality and equal opportunity.
Their thoughts are very natural.
They told me about an incident and artisans from Bangalore are talking to him.
A woman Froda snatched a cheetmail and snatched 11 lakh rupees and then read the news that she committed suicide in an article.
As a woman, I feel sorry to her family.
I'd like to know what you think about such a cheet-frodemail.
In a few minutes, he's lost everything.
You're sometimes wrong.
They'll be so simple, they'll be stories.
But I had a very funny experience in this neighborhood.
Some students from Aligarh came to me.
Men and girls were very enthusiastic.
They came as a big album and enjoyed their faces.
Artificial paintings were done at the station.
Not only this, they have collected plastic bottles and oil utensils in the rural areas and planted the soil and planted the Vertical Garden.
And on one side of the railway station, the Vertical Garden has been built in plastic bottles and has given it a new feeling.
My dear countrymen, the period of festivals has come in our country over the years.
Think of it, don't you give a gift to your sister to protect her life and not only will there be women who cook food in our house.
There will be a woman who cleanses our house and she'll be the daughter of a poor mother.
This is the true meaning of Rakshabandhan.
My dear countrymen, many of us were born in the post-independence period.
I am the first Prime Minister born in the years of independence.
May the whole country be filled with the zeal of freedom fighters and once again prostrate the hatred of freedom.
We can create an atmosphere.
And the Independence Day Celebrations should become a programme of the people of the country without a government programme.
Like Diwali, we have to celebrate our own.
I wish you and patriotism, including inspiration from patriotism, will do some good things in this regard.
Its pictures must be sent to the Narendra Modi App.
Create an atmosphere in the country.
You might have wished that those things in your mind should be presented from the Red Fort as fast as possible.
As a representative of your thoughts in your mind, as your chief servant, I invite you from the Red Fort if I want to say these things.
I do not want to be the Prime Minister's words from the Red Fort.
And nowadays, the platform for technology is easier for you to access things to me.
I am grateful to the Akashwani by presenting Mann Ki Baat in local languages at 8 pm.
Several of these suggestions are helping my government work.
Perhaps the news is coming for a week to start the rainy season, so our concerns are also there.
In most parts of the country, there is extreme heat of summer.
Climate change increases such problems.
The area of the forests is low and the trees are cut.
In a way, human beings destroy nature and destroy themselves.
June 5 is World Environment Day.
Discussions on the environment are going on all over the world.
In the last few days, the forests of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Himalayan valleys have become a fire.
In the last few days, I got the opportunity to interact with the Chief Ministers of 11 States of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Odisha.
I listened carefully to tell every country.
Normally, there was no such micro-deliberal discussion on how much the Central Government has given and how much the amount has been spent.
It was also a matter of immense imagination to the officials of the Government of India that in many areas, water conservation, environment, dry degradation, animal husbandry and in a way for drought-affected people, have done excellent work for the entire country.
I asked NITI Aayog to adopt good models and take steps to implement it in other states.
Some states, particularly Andhra and Gujarat, have fully benefited from technology.
Now I would like to take the successful tests of the States to other areas through NITI Aayog.
Democracy is a major infrastructure for success in such issues.
Perhaps, if there is a comprehensive plan then by using appropriate technologies, if the provisions are fulfilled within the time frame, there can be a significant change, I believe.
Irrigation is also important.
Their aim is to incorporate more than two to three lakh hectares of land every year in a micro-irrigation.
Chhattisgarh has implemented the Lok Suraj Jal Suraj Abhiyan.
Approximately 22,000 ponds have been included in the Balram Talab Yojana of Madhya Pradesh, which is not a small number.
They had the goal of water conservation. In some states, projects for conservation of water from 10 to 20 kms have been constructed by small branches.
It's a good experience.
I would like to say that no one drop of rain water is available till June, July, August and September.
We have to think about what should be the place for water conservation.
God has provided water to our needs and nature has fulfilled our needs.
We'll be careless after seeing a lot of water and we'll be disturbed without getting water after the rainy season.
The media had spoken about the problems of water availability in the last few days.
I believe that the media should provide water conservation guidance and expand its activities and media will also participate in the ways to solve water conservation.
I invite them for that.
My dear countrymen, we have to build a New India.
Create a transparent India.
Our schemes should be made available in every corner of India without integration.
We have to make small changes in our old mindset.
But today the situation has completely changed.
The world looks at the vision of a cashless society.
It is possible to send and handle money from all over the world through electronic technology.
Together, we can drive as a fugitive community.
Perhaps you can see that RPA CARD has been given with Jan Dhan account.
In the coming days, this card can be used at the level of Credit Debit Card.
The pocket doesn't need money, oil or anything.
This is the Bank on Mobile - Universal Payment Interface Banking Transction - PI which will transform stable systems.
The Money Transction Payment through your mobile phone will be very easy.
Perhaps, if this is possible easily, there is no need to carry RPA CARDs together.
Moreover, post offices have also been active for banking services.
Unlawful transactions will remain forever.
The effect of black money will be better.
So, my countrymen, I wish we'll start this.
Once we start, we can move very easily.
Today, if anybody had thought about it 10 years ago, such a mobile will be in our hands.
So let's turn into a non-money society.
Well, it would have been better if it could happen without a knee.
My dear countrymen, sometimes when Olympics competition or when we start playing, we will be behind the gold medal.
I've got silver.
In order to encourage our sportspersons who are going to participate in the Rio Olympics, each one must enhance spirituality and enthusiasm in their own way.
In the last week, all of us were worried about the results of the election, particularly the results in Assam.
Encouraging sportspersons, promoting our sportspersons, these things give each other a great spirit and strength.
With the sportsman spirit, India has to put its seal in front of the world without putting everyone in the rock of victory.
Results of students who have been examining the 10th and 12th classes have been working hard throughout the year.
I want to tell those who have not been able to achieve success, there is a lot to do in life.
A Mister Gaurav in Madhya Pradesh...
Gaurav Patel presented a big problem before me.
33 per cent of the market was not satisfied.
Everyone was telling me that I lost 90 percent of the 4 marks.
I don't know what I felt like a weight in my mind.
Gaurav I read your letter carefully.
I guess, maybe this pain is not yours.
Like you, millions and millions of students are also there, because this is the environment that has been conserved.
By finding satisfaction in all matters, we can lead the society towards satisfaction and peace.
Your family, helpers and friends will have 89.
I have written to Anand Giri Goswami from Jodhpur that is almost the same thing.
He says people in my neighbourhood do not accept our results.
If a little better - I don't remember the whole poem, but I had written a poet in the canvas of my life a long time ago.
Some said it was yellow instead of blue, it was nice.
Some people said it would have been better if it was there instead of putting it here.
If you see the picture of my pain, one or two people had tears, it would have been so good.
Everyone was talking about the tuckup.
Millions of students like you are like this.
You are capable of meeting the needs of the people.
I want to tell you so much that you don't lose your balance in such a situation.
Everyone shows the needs.
But keep yourself steadfast and try to fulfil a little better.
But if we are not satisfied with the availability, then the new goal will never be fulfilled.
The strong foundation of victory is based on great success.
The dissatisfaction that has come out of success is not the pace of success.
It happens everywhere in life.
You might have heard about Santoor's architect.
There was a time when Santoor aeroplanes were associated with folk music in the Kashmir Valley.
But Pandit Shivakumar took it and made it the greatest architect of the world.
Shehnai- Our music was in very limited places around the world.
Most of the kings were at its doorstep.
But when Ustad took over in Bishmila Khan Shehna, it turned into a universal aeroplane.
It is true that the cost of not being a patient is very low, but if the disease comes, the cost of recovery is very high.
If anyone can help the poor, it's only for cleanliness.
June 21 is International Day of Yoga.
There is a special faith in Yoga all over the world, respect and faith.
Yoga provides the power to lead a balanced life to a stressed world.
Every individual has to spend 20-25 minutes in his lifestyle or 30 minutes for Yoga.
For this, we are inspiring on 21st June, Yoga Day.
Sometimes a social environment is the reason for bringing about changes in the life of a person.
I hope you'll take the lead anywhere on June 21.
In your neighbourhoods, in your cities, in villages, in your schools and institutions, repeat it even in the office.
Start a month from now, and see, you'll be part of it on June 21.
I'm going to attend this event in Chandigarh.
My dear countrymen, through this programme Mann Ki Baat, I have always been associated with you.
A long time ago, I gave you a mobile number, in which you could call Missid and listen to Mann Ki Baat.
But it has made it more simple.
You have only four times to listen to Mann Ki Baat.
If you call this number in 1922, you can hear Mann Ki Baat in any language anywhere.
My dear countrymen, I salute you all once again.
Don't forget the water I said.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
Mann Ki Baat is a time when I and you are waiting.
This time too many letters, commands and phone calls have been received, many stories, instructions and inspirations...
People were discussing books on science, technology, new innovations, history, culture, business, lifestyle etc.
People urged me to discuss many other books.
But I have to say that I can't move time to read a lot of books.
We have already started a permanent book corner on the Narendra Modi App and we can write and discuss it as soon as we read a new book.
You can suggest a name to this book corner.
I would like this book corner to become an active platform for readers and writers.
Several experts have been working in the field of water conservation.
People share information about traditional methods.
For instance, the spirit of rural water conservation in the village of Arakaram in Ormanji Block, a short distance from Ranchi in Jharkhand, has become an example of everybody.
The charming state of North-Eastern India, the Meghalaya has turned into a water reservoir.
I congratulate the government there.
In Haryana, very little water is required, but emphasis is being laid on non-compromising farming.
I specially congratulate the Government of Haryana for inspiring farmers to take them away from traditional farming and cultivate some water.
It's time for festivals now.
Festivals are also held during the festivals.
These fairs should also be used for water conservation.
People from all sections of the society come to the fairs.
In these fairs, the message of water conservation can be given very well, exhibitions, street players and messages of water conservation along with festivals can be made very unsuccessful.
Friends, some things in life fill us with enthusiasm.
In particular, the achievements of children and their works give us new energy.
So I want to talk about some children.
They are Nidhi Baipato, Monish Joshi, Devamshi Rawat, Tanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tiwari, Prati Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Arnayesh Ganguli, Hrithik Alamda.
I'm talking about them and fill your mind with pride and enthusiasm.
We all know that the word Cancer is the most frightening thing in the world.
After winning the game, he won a medal and becomes a champion.
But before they participated in the competition, it was a unique occasion that they became Champions.
That's the champions of life.
World Children's Winners Games were held in Moscow this month.
In their lives, the winners who fought with cancer participated in the competition like shooting, chase, swimming, drive and football.
All these champions of our country won medals in the tournament.
Some of these sportspersons won medals in more than one species.
My dear countrymen, you must have been proud of Indias success in the sky beyond the sky.
Chandrayaan-2.
In Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Sanjay Haripura, Kolkata, Mahendra Kumar Daga, Telangana and P.
In terms of space, 2019 is a good year for India.
Our scientists launched ASAT in March.
India is the fourth country in the world to achieve this achievement.
On July 22, the country was proud to move from Chandrayaan 2 to Sriharikota to the atmosphere.
The launch pictures of Chandrayaan II filled the people with pride, enthusiasm and joy.
Chandrayaan-2 Mission is special in different ways.
You will be happy to note that Chandrayaan-2 is completely Indian.
But we must always remember that it's capable of living.
I hope that Chandrayaan will inspire the youth of 2 countries to turn to the world of science and innovation.
Science is ultimately opening the path of development.
We are awaiting for September the time Lander Vikram and Rover Pragyan landed on the surface of the moon.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to share information about a very attractive competition with the students and youngsters of the country.
The youngsters of the country want to invite youngsters to a quiz competition and the knowledge related to space, Indias scientific mission and scientific technologies will be an important issue.
I urge young friends and students to participate in this issue and make it attractive, pleasant and unforgettable through your partnership.
I specially urge schools, guardians, enthusiasts and teachers to strive hard to achieve their school.
Encourage all schools to participate in this.
This will be a historic event in their lives for the winners.
But you have to take part in this problem, get the mark, be successful.
Encourage more friends.
Friends, you'll take care of something.
Our Mann Ki Baat Swachhta Abhiyan has increased the pace from time to time.
When they performed their skills from the walls of Over Bridges and Schools to the huts, people along with them became a big initiative.
You must have seen how Prayag Raj was decorated with street paintings on the occasion of Kumbh.
Yogesh Saini and his friends played a very big role in discourse.
We need to develop a culture from waste to wealth in our society.
In a way, we have to move from waste to gold.
My dear countrymen, last day, I read a very attractive promise in MyGov.
Bhai Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Shopian in Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote: It is very happy to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I have participated actively in organizing the Back to Village for Community Mobility Programme in my State of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was organized in June.
I believe that such programmes should extend every three months.
Also, the programme should be monitored online.
This programme shows how immortal and enthusiastic the people of Kashmir are to join the mainstream of development.
For the first time, the big officers came to the villages and the non-visional officers came to their homes to understand the obstacles in development and address the problems of the villagers and the programme took place for a week.
How to increase the income of the people
He explained how the service of the officers is affecting the lives of the common man and the rural and the minds were open and said their problems.
Discussions were held on issues such as literacy, male ratio, health, waste free, water conservation, electricity, water, education of girls and problems of elderly citizens.
Friends, this programme was not a function of the government, but this time the authorities had spent two days and one night in the Panchayat, so that they got the opportunity to spend time in the village.
He added a number of things to make this program more attractive.
Under the leadership of Khelo India, the sports competition was held for the children.
He also distributed sports kits, Job Cards of National Employment Programme (NEP), Patik caste and Scheduled Certificates.
This kind of programmes and peoples participation in them want our brothers and sisters of Kashmir to rule and understand that the strength of progress is beyond the strength of bombs and guns.
It is obvious that those who want to hatred on the path of development, who want to obstruct, cannot achieve their immaculate goals.
My dear countrymen, the Gyanpeeth Awardee Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandre said this in his poem about the glory of the month of Shravan.
In this, he said, Hodige Madige Agyedu Taraga land Magna is a different link between the rainy season and the waterfalls, and the earth is enriched by its beauty.
People from different cultures and languages across India celebrate the month of Shravan in their own ways.
In this weather, we look at the environment, it seems that the earth is greenery.
We can see a new energy all around.
On the other hand, people observe regular fasting and hopefully wait for excitement like Janmashtami and Naga Panchami.
During this time, the Rakshabandhan Festival was a symbol of the love of brothers and sisters.
On the occasion of Shravana, devotees participated in the Amarnath Yatra this time over the last four years.
From 1st July till now, more than 3 lakh pilgrims visited the sacred Amarnath cave.
More than 60 days in 2015, more than the participants participated in this journey in just 28 days this time.
I congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their practices for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
People who come back from the journey are changing the spirit of the people of the state and their own thinking.
All these are very helpful in the future pilgrimage.
On the other hand, it is a time for heavy rains in many parts of the country.
My dear countrymen, it is very difficult to decide where to start Mann Ki Baat and where to stop.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
There is no shortage of festivals in our country.
Sometimes it feels that India is a country of economic integrity through festivals.
Festivals are an opportunity for the poor of the society to become an opportunity for economic integrity.
You know I'm using technologies well and I'm getting a lot of information.
Ganesh V.
Savelesh Worker wrote to me that this season is the tourist season.
Several national and foreign tourists are coming.
People celebrate Christmas holidays.
Sometimes they listen to disappointment from different corners of the country.
It is the strength of the country that millions of people do something good in their own way, like a fool.
Education and employment creates new opportunities everyday.
When the world is attracted by Yoga and celebrates International Day of Yoga, we have believed and pride in the strength of India.
This vision of India is reflected in our minds.
Cleanliness is being heard in the houses today.
The participation of the people is increasing.
That's a service route.
I've made a little effort on my way.
I can't do everything alone.
My dear youth, on August 15, the Red Fort has started the first discussion on Start-up India and Stand-up India.
This was followed by discussions in government departments.
Can India be the Startup Capital
In order to provide a big opportunity to the youth among the States, we will be able to start new start-ups and new innovations, whether in the manufacturing sector or in the service sector or in the agriculture cleanliness.
If you think it's wrong.
Youngsters from any corner of India are talented to give them an opportunity.
Start-up India and Stand-up India should not be confined to just a few cities.
It should spread to every corner of India.
I urge the State Governments to expand this.
On January 16, I will discuss this with you.
I will welcome your suggestions.
My dear youth, January 12 is the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.
Millions of people like me who are inspired by Swami Vivekananda are here.
From 1995, Swami Vivekananda Jayanti is being celebrated as National Youth Festival on 12th January.
This year, from 12th to 16th January, it is celebrated in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
A small India is going to be built there - a young India.
In a way, dreams can be seen.
You can see the strength of the decisions.
Can you share your suggestions on this Youth Festival
I think this is the result of your initiatives.
Thank you one thousand.
Are you a person working in this field
That's why you can understand it, do you have to face a lot of problems
Sometimes the handicapped, sometimes the disabled, sometimes the disabilities and so many words.
It's really important in every word.
This year, the Government of India started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan.
I hope you take it.
Have we started the Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan
This will bring them to ease by developing all kinds of infrastructure.
Whether it is school, hospital, government offices, bus stations, railway stations, parking, lift, braille scripts, all these innovations are required to make them easier.
Technologies are required and systems are required to sensitize.
Its efforts have started and people's participation is getting.
People love it.
Before that the files shouldn't be executed.
In fact, all the schemes are for the common man and the poor.
In the last few days, the Government of India has conducted an inquiry into how to benefit the right rights of the schemes.
In our country, subsidy is provided to gas cylinders.
It wasn't checked whether it was properly maintaining the accounts.
Therefore, the government has made some changes.
Integrating Aadhar Cards, the mission to provide subsidy to the beneficiaries directly through the worlds largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme through Jan Dhan Account.
I am glad to note that it has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records in the name of the world's largest Director Benefit Transfer Scheme.
On the one hand, it continues to prepare a list of beneficiaries and connect them to the bank accounts through Aadhaar, opening of Jan Dhan Account on the other, and in collaboration with the Central State Governments.
At many places, the money is directly deposited in the accounts of the workers.
There were complaints about students' scholarships and efforts have been made to solve them.
About 40 crore rupees have been directly accessed to the accounts of beneficiaries through various schemes.
Approximately 30 to 40 projects have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.
My dear Indians, January 26 is the golden moment of the Republic of India.
In the Parliament, two days have been replaced for a special discussion on the Constitution.
It was a good experience.
We are most conscious of the obligations in the election time and it is our duty to vote through publications and wallwriters.
Why don't we talk about duties and duties in the day-to-day life like elections
On 26th January, when the country celebrates the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, should the country hold discussions on the basis of duties in schools, colleges, villages, cities and organizations
If 125 crore people take one step after another and fulfill their duties then it will be an unforgettable history.
We'll start discussions on it.
You've got the opportunity to go anywhere.
Festivals have its own importance in social life.
The news of natural calamities continues to come from every corner of the world.
We've never thought or imagined these dangers.
Now we have experienced how fast the impact of climate change is increasing.
The central government and shoulders work with them.
However, in the environment, there is a need for change.
It's starting a good start.
Today, I received a phone message from Jalandar in Punjab to Lakshadweep Singh, "I speak from Jalandar district of Punjab.
I am very happy to hear your questions, the Prime Minister said.
The main reason for my happiness is that you're doing bio-driven.
Not only that, along with biological farming, you understand the problems of the farmers.
But it's not right to think that this is happening only in Punjab and Haryana.
This is the habit of every Indian, and we are following the traditional way of burning the ruins of crops.
First of all, we didn't know about such losses.
Everyone does it, we do it.
Secondly, it didn't give any training to do it.
But your apprehension is right.
But they're not real.
The ruins of the crops are also expensive.
Secondly, the surface of the earth is burnt with fire.
We can't live even if the heart is strong.
Likewise, if the ruins of the crop are burnt, it's not only the ruins of the earth but the skin of the mother.
Animal food can also be used, which saves our land.
Not only that, look at the cultivation from the same land, it's double profit.
Once I got the opportunity to talk to the farmers who cultivate wheat.
They shared a good experience.
Earlier, they used to cultivate bananas, after harvesting, one hectare had to spend five thousand, ten thousand and ten thousand to change the ruins of banana.
The ruins of the banana will remain like that until those who don't change the tractor.
However, some farmers buried these ruins of bananas in the earth as pieces of 6-8 inches.
Last time I had talked about organ donation in 'Mann Ki Baat'.
He was also told about the helpline of 'Chhatcha' to donate organs.
Various prominent personalities including filmmaker Ravina Tandon participated in the event.
You can save many valuable lives with organ donation.
In a way organ donation gives immortality .
When an organ changes from one body to another, that organ gets a new life and that life gets a new life.
What else donates greater than this
A National Level Registration of Organ Transplantation was launched on 27th November for patients waiting for organ transplantation.
I am confident that there will be widespread awakening in every field and in the true sense, the needy will get the best support.
Everyone has to move forward for this.
As I mentioned earlier, December 3 is the International Disabilities Day.
Physically and mentally different are the owners of unprecedented will and courage.
They feel sorry when they are hiding.
We'll start crying when there's a little trouble.
It feels how little our pain is thinking about how they live.
How do they live
Their determination, their way of life, their zeal to transform the evils into capabilities is commendable.
Today I want to talk about Javed Ahmed.
He's 40-42 years old.
The terrorists shot him in Kashmir in 1996.
He was miraculously saved while he was hit by the guns of the terrorists.
But one of his kidneys was destroyed, one part of the intestine was lost.
The spinal cord has been severely damaged.
I lost my ability to stand in my feet, but he didn't fail.
He didn't lose the wound of terrorism.
How to improve connectivity to physically disabled persons, how to make arrangements in public places and government offices.
Is Javed's life sufficient to inspire every corner of India
On December 3, I remember the life of Javed Ahmed, his penance and his dedication.
I am just talking about Javed because of lack of time, but in every corner of India such inspirational lamps are fluttering.
Our country is too big.
There are many things dependent on the government.
More than one experience changes our vision of government systems throughout the lifetime.
They are doing a lot of social work in India.
Millions of people can work around us like this.
If you see the patient with love, what's the joy
Are they becoming a partner in the sad sadness of the society
I congratulate all the aspirational workers of India in the name of 'Jamuna Mani'.
Besides discussing the books, some of the youngsters should tell the students of eight or nine or ten classes of nearby schools, what is happening here and what is happening here.
Not only this, you are actually becoming a good teacher of a society.
I warmly welcome you all to the nation building.
My dear countrymen, today the world is afraid of climate change.
A friend who led me to sharing this unprecedented experience had sent me an ink to know and see it.
But if they say something they've done, it's not like some other educated people have thought about it.
They are working towards bringing light to the poor in their area through solar energy.
They fought against darkness and made their name unfolded.
They built a plant of solar lighting through a combination of women.
Every month, they are paying a random to the residents of the area at a rent of just 100 rupees.
We know what big people in the world are doing about climate change.
Thank you very much to Ee News.
But the beginning is very good.
In a short span of time, 66 lakh people have been able to get Rs. 40,000 crore (Rs. 42,000 crore) through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
It will benefit those who are employed in jobs, journalists, servants and those who are employed in any job.
Abhishek shared his happiness.
There's a lot of things in front of me.
The other is Shilesh Bhosla from Mumbai.
Under the Mudra Yojana, Rs. 8.
I was telling you during our Swachh Bharat programme that there is a new entrepreneurship in this scheme.
But Shailesh Bhosle has succeeded in bringing it to work.
But many don't know enough about this project.
How should the programme be formed
How should Logo be
But I'm expecting many more suggestions.
Several basic projects are required.
It will also provide honour to those living partners.
Moreover, many other gifts have been announced.
My dear brothers, the month of winter has started.
Make a fair environment in the family and make it a festival together and join the exercise.
Through the Exercise Festival, you can recognise how much is the bottom of Chaitanya.
The whole day the body will be more vibrant.
If you're a good weather, you're gonna have a good habit.
My dear friends, once again I congratulate you.
Jai Hind.
Last year on October 3, I had the privilege of presenting Mann Ki Baat.
A year through Mann Ki Baat.
Our ancestors used to say that the voice of the people is the voice of the people.
From my experiences in the Mann Ki Baat programme, it can be said that this idea of our ancestors has great strength and truth because I have experienced it.
Several topics began to move from the bottom to the government.
And, it is really the principle of governance that the information should come down from the top to the bottom and above.
Did anyone ever think that Mann Ki Baat would be a source of knowledge
But it happened.
This is how Mann Ki Baat has created an opportunity to showcase the strength of the community.
I was surprised all over the world that I said one day with selfie, Daughter.
It was a quiet revolution.
People from every corner of India have sent lakhs of pictures.
Perhaps the tourism departments of the Government of India or the State Government have had such a rich heritage with us.
Mann Ki Baat has become a platform and people have taken up work without spending one rupee to the government.
I am happy to note about Gandhiji in my first Mann Ki Baat programme in October last year.
On the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, I had urged the people to celebrate the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October and promote Khadi products across the country.
There was a time when Khadi was called for the nation.
Do you want to make it fashionable now, according to the change of time
I wanted people to buy Khadi and do something.
After that, I am happy to say that Khadi sales are almost doubled.
This wasn't done by the government publication.
This is not the achievement of lakhs and crores of rupees.
It is a feeling of manpower and a victory.
Once I said in Mann Ki Bati, the poor smoke in the house, the children cry.
They want to get the LPG cylinders
Today, I am happy to say that 30 lakh families have left the subsidy of LPG in our country.
I saw a retired school teacher in the channel standing in ueen to call for a widow woman's subsidy.
It's difficult for the middle class and the lower class to quit subsidy.
But these people have left the subsidy.
Isn't it a quiet revolution
We can't see people's power in this.
The lessons of the government should be included in the framework of our government, which has a large population-powered, energetic and determined society outside the framework.
What else do you want to be happy
I thought of a new experiment in Mann Ki Baat this time.
There will be no place where people don't have phone calls.
That's a pleasant feeling.
People of all ages have sent a message.
I wanted to hear some messages myself and I liked it.
My team is taking action for the rest.
All the departments of the government will definitely consider your suggestions.
But one thing wondered and enjoyed me.
Perhaps I think we're neglected.
But my experience is forgotten.
These 50,000 people said their way.
You can understand how creative the common people of the country think and how big it is for the country.
Perhaps, only one or two phone calls will be seen from the backdrop of serious complaints.
More than 90 percent of the energy delivery was a pleasure.
They must have heard the radio.
Pawan Acharya sent me a message from Alwar in Rajasthan.
My message to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi is that please urge the people of India to use the best monasteries for Diwali through this Mann Ki Baat programme.
This will benefit the environment and create opportunities for thousands of soil-building brothers to get jobs.
I believe that like Pawan Acharya, your feelings will reach and spread every corner of India.
I say to the people of the country that if we are implementing the words of Pawan Acharya in the coming festivals, then the day lamp will be found in their homes but the light will be spread in the houses of the poor.
My dear countrymen, on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi, I got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of the army
With our armed forces protecting the sea-borne air.
In 1965, 50 years have passed since the war with Pakistan.
In the name of this, an exhibition was organised at India Gate in Delhi.
What wasn't there
If you want to create history, it is necessary to know and understand the subtle levels of history.
History links us to our roots.
If we lose relations with history then the prospects of building history will also be reflected.
Don't show up like me.
I've been back in two and a half hours.
That kid was right.
And I've been able to hear what happened.
I don't feel that it's a bad thing and even in the good Parliament I've seen it, discussions about India's cleanliness are going on.
On the other hand, Parliament on the other hand, on the other hand, a child and both of them talk about cleanliness and one more fortunate for one country.
This revolution of ideas is creating an atmosphere of hatred towards cleanliness and awakening towards cleanliness.
This will compel the governments to work.
We have to take forward the crimes and deficiencies, and when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we have to take this task to realize the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi has said
If there is an opportunity to choose cleanliness and freedom, then I will first choose cleanliness and then freedom.
Gandhiji gave the importance of cleanliness more than independence.
Gulshan Arora Mygov from Delhi.
I want to know about the birth centenary of Deen Dayal ji.
My dear friends, the life of the great men always inspires us.
It is not to evaluate what our work and the great men were followers of.
We are inspired by every individual who lives and dies for the country.
During these days, there is an opportunity to remember many great men.
On 25th September, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, Mahatma Gandhi on 2nd October, Lal Bahadur Shastri Jaiprakash Narayan on 11th October and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 31st October.
On October 2, I put forward a special grace.
If it benefits, it gives equal importance to handicrafts with Khadi.
The wealthy brothers are doing a lot of work.
The poor widows of Khadi will come to the house.
That's why this Deepawali will surely be dragged to each other's house and body.
Look, last time sales have almost doubled.
My dear countrymen, I am happy in one thing.
That's what I share with you.
When I went to Kolkata in May, the family of Subhash Chandra Bose came to see me.
He was his son-in-law who arranged everything.
I got the opportunity to spend with the family of Subhas Chandra Bose for a long time.
"My name is Bhargavi.
I am sure to make the younger generation aware of the Voters Registration and in the coming days, the participation of the youth will increase and in the future, the participation of the youth will increase in the elections and governance of the government.
Thank you, Bharagvi said, "It is a matter of enrollment and voting in the voter list.
I would like to specially congratulate the Election Commission of India in this regard.
A few years ago, we had seen that our Electoral Commission was only a regulator, but there has been a major change in the last few years.
It's a very good change, but it's not enough for the Election Commission to work.
Generally, I want to say that the polling day before the election and drinking water.
One, seven-year-old Kshitij Pandey is studying in the 7th class at the Central School of the Banaras Hindu University.
I want to increase the scientific and interest of children in our country.
It's only 9 years old.
When she asked her father, she said that it's been telling me since the age of 5.
I asked, where did you learn
Then I thought I should share with you.
We're doing a lot of things that you see on TV and don't know through papers.
I'm gonna have to do it once a month and I'm gonna have to do it.
Friends from the skies have to wait for half an hour.
It's the best time for a month to launch.
The beginning was from Germany and the citizens of India were addressing the freedom struggle through radio.
The beginning of Azad Hind Radio was through Responsibilities.
He was also broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urudu.
I have also completed a year by presenting Mann Ki Baat through the skyline.
Next month we'll meet Mann Ki Bati.
May your suggestions continue to come.
The government is beneficial with your suggestions.
It begins to make a good change.
Your partnership is valuable, precious.
Once again my best wishes.
My dear countrymen, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today delivered a special address to the people of India through Akashwani on 30th August 2015.
I've got a chance to present things in front of you.
Far from far, South Indians observe anonymity and celebrate the holy festival of Raksha Bandhan throughout our country.
The Government of India has implemented new schemes for social security to the common man.
Within a short span of time, all the dignitaries have adopted these projects.
On the auspicious festival of Rakshabandhan, I had requested our sisters to implement security schemes.
I see it as a good sign.
On the auspicious festival of Rakshabandhan, all the best wishes to all mothers and sisters.
Today, a year before I had spoken to you, the Jan Dhan Yojana was provided to the people in large numbers.
The main road to the economy is in the banking sector and the bank mitra scheme has been formulated to reach out to the poor.
Today, more than one and a half lakh bank friends are working throughout the country.
This has provided employment to the youth.
You will be glad to hear that over a year, the banking sector, the financial system and the poor have done one lakh and three thousand fiscal awareness camps to connect with it.
It's your job to continue this relationship.
All our accounts should be efficient.
In the past, I got the opportunity to meet the pundits of the Sufi tradition.
Their voices, their conversations, i.e. generosity and harmony in the Sufi tradition, have the blossom of music.
I have got the invitation to participate in it and I am happy that they invited me to Bodhgaya.
Pandit Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, visited Bodhgaya.
With these scholars from all over the world, there will be an opportunity to go to Bodhgaya.
It will be a very pleasant moment for me and my dear farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to talk to my mind again.
We have already mentioned these issues.
You must have heard me in the Parliament, you must have heard me in the public meetings, you must have heard Mann Ki Baat.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you don't have to be afraid.
I don't give anybody such a chance.
We were in the middle of an Ordinance.
Tomorrow, the term of Ordnance is going to be completed on 31st August.
I've decided to finish if the term is over.
My farmer brothers and sisters, Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan, I want to wear this not only a mirror but also a mantra of ours.
I'm gonna tell you another thing.
Two days ago, 50 years of war in 1965 was completed.
Whenever this war in 1965 was remembered, Lal Bahadur Scientific is a commemorative routine.
He will also remember his mirror Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan.
At the same time, it is very natural to remember all the martyrs who have maintained the Tricoloured Flag of India, its significance and glory.
I salute all those associated with the 65th war victory.
I salute the heroes.
Such miracles of history are inspiring us.
Last week, as I had the opportunity to interact with the people of Sufi tradition, I got the opportunity to interact with the leading scientists of the country for hours and listen to their suggestions.
India is showing great work in various fields of science and I am very happy.
In fact, our scientists are doing great things.
How to bring such research to the common man
How to use these principles at the practical level
I have said in the last Mann Ki Baat that we should lead our students to the science sector.
I thought there was a lot of opportunities and opportunities after this discussion.
I want to tell my dear young friends something special.
In recent times, there were many guests from all over the world to India.
Why don't we connect our festivals with cleanliness
The beginning of the rain was good this year.
There is a lot of foodgrains, oilseeds and peasants in our country.
Poor people need food grains and oil to cook vegetables.
However, the crops this year are very happy and about 50 of the food grains have increased by 33 of the oilseeds this year.
I specially congratulate my farmer brothers and sisters for their causes.
My dear friends, July 26 is marked as a Vijay Diwas in the history of our country.
The more the farmers of the country have a relationship with the land, the more the relationship between the soldiers and the nation.
In the Kargil war, each of our soldiers has dedicated hundreds of enemies.
As a result of all their collective sacrifices, India can speak to the world today.
This is the reason why I congratulate our brave soldiers for the victory day in Kargil.
Smt. Suchitra Raghavacharya, Chennai has sent several suggestions.
I believe all of you will send good instructions.
I want to make my vision clear in one respect.
I don't want to give any advice to anybody, but I don't want to find ways to evacuate the state governments, the central governments, the local autonomous bodies or their responsibilities.
Two days ago, I had noticed the scene of a vehicle accident in Delhi and 10 minutes after the accident, the scooters were snatching the road.
He couldn't get any help.
Likewise, many people write to me on issues related to embarrassment and make people aware about road safety issues.
Be it Hoskot resident of Bangalore, be it Prasanka Kunje in Mudubidri in Karnataka - people are very much, I don't remember the names of all of them.
In our country, every accident occurs every day in a minute.
One death occurs every four minutes in road accidents.
The most painful thing is that about one third of those who die is a youth between 15 and 25, each of these deaths holds the entire family.
The other thing I remember is that a small group of government officials in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh have touched my heart.
'Brother No. 1' is an excellent brother to give his sister a toilet as a gift on the day of Rakshabandhan.
Inspire all such brothers and make toilets for their sisters and mothers and sisters in the entire district, they do not have to urinate in the open space.
Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh is a small village living in workers.
The people of that village have started and completed the campaign to construct toilets in the last few months.
Now in that village no one has to urinate in the open space.
Bhavesh Dheka writes to me about the problems in the North-Eastern States from Guwahati, who are also televisionists.
Similarly, a team of Central Government officials decided to conduct a seven-day camp in states like Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Assam and Sikkim and visit the North-Eastern states.
The results of this endeavour will be seen in the days to come.
It is very sad to lose the vision of science.
In a way, science and technology are intended to develop.
Our IAS officers have learned a lot of things and should always interact with children in schools and colleges around two or four hours a week, their experiences are their strength.
We have started it and in the coming years our villages will get 24 hours of electricity.
Children of the village do not have difficulty while studying on exam days.
If we want to start small and big industries in the villages then we need electricity.
Today, if they want to charge the mobile, they have to go to the next village.
The facilities available in the cities should be available to the villages.
For this, Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti programme was started.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, my heart has said to talk about every Indian.
Similarly, the months of August and September are the days of our celebrations.
We have a lot of festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
He had said many things and listened to many things like talking to the family about 130 crore people in a peaceful environment while sitting among the needy.
Perhaps it becomes an inspiration for those who want to do their own things.
I just used my words, but I didn't think it wasn't me, it was you.
I felt a shit.
Anyway, the last chance has reached.
In a family household, Mann Ki Baat, little and little kids.
May this programme continue to mix the vibration of a New India by giving birth to a new vibration in society and life.
Several messages have been received in the past months, in which people said that there is no 'Mann Ki Baat' that hurts.
Sometimes I feel that this is my journey from 'Swa' to 'Samashti'.
This is the journey from me to Nami.
For me, my interaction with you was a part of my spiritual journey in a way.
Many people asked a lot of questions about why I went to Kedarnath during the elections.
As far as I was concerned, I had the opportunity to meet me.
I went to see me in a way.
Sometimes because of my thought process being inspired, sometimes sometimes it gets irritated.
When people face the challenges faced by the nation and the society, they suggest solutions.
In letters, people describe problems, at the same time speak peace and suggestions, some imagination, direct or indirect.
That is, in a way, I feel in your words a sign of how problems get peace for the society.
Mann Ki Baat is like a glass for the country and the society.
It tells us that there is no dearth of soul, strength or privacy within the people.
We have to unite that power and that preciseness, give them an opportunity and implement them.
The Prime Minister said that 130 crore people want to be actively and actively involved in the progress of the country.
When I analyze these things, you can imagine how much my mind feels and how much energy I get.
This belief was the foundation of your faith.
With this feeling, we can continue Mann Ki Baat.
Therefore, not for the country but for the country, the election was not for selfishness, it was an election for the protection of democracy.
Perhaps, in one country of the world, the people of the world have not voted for democracy only without calculating their remaining rights, powers and requirements.
The country saw such an election in 1977.
In India, more than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and we feel that this number is common.
However, if this is considered to be the world's population then it will be seen that more than a country except China, people have voted in India.
The number of people voted in 2019 is more than the total population in America, almost doubled.
The total number of voters in India is more than the population in Europe.
This reflects the vastness and diversity of our democracy.
The Lok Sabha elections in 2019 were the largest democratic elections in the world.
You can imagine how much resources and manpower are required to conduct such elections.
This election was done by lakhs of teachers, officers and other industrialists in the daytime.
Nearly 3 lakh members of the Armed Forces have been responsible for the successful conduct of this great campaign of democracy and 20 lakh police personnel from different states have performed their duties and worked hard.
As a result of their hard work, more people were forced to vote this time than before.
About 10 lakh polling stations across the country, more than 40 lakh electronic voting machines and more than 17 lakh Vivipat machines have come up for voting.
Let's think you're ready.
One voter can't use his voter, and that's why he did all this.
Polling stations have been prepared for only one woman voter in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to hear that the election officer had to travel for two days to get there.
This is the right respect for democracy.
India is also the highest polling station in the world.
This polling station is located at a height of 15,000 feet at Lahole Spiti in Himachal Pradesh.
In this election, the percentage of votes of women and men was almost equal.
Another exciting fact that this time there are 78 women members in the Parliament to reduce history.
I appreciate the Election Commission and everyone associated with the Returning Programme and salute the awakening voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard me often saying, "Bokay No Book."
I said, 'Use a book instead of flowers to welcome people.'
Since then, people have started giving books at different places.
His stories involve all the emotions of India.
When he was reading the story of 'Nasha' (Lahari) my mind turned towards the economic imbalance spread in the society.
I remembered the days I was young.
How the discussion took place overnight on this subject came to mind.
If you don't care if the son of Jamindar is able to learn from this story of Ishwar and Bir of the poor family then you can't understand when it's getting stuck in the influence of a bad companion.
A sensitive child's immortal love for his grandfather is a rigid emotion in his young age.
In fact, when we come to Grandma by buying a cottage from the Hamid Festival of 4-5 years of age, we really see that human sentiment has reached Paramya.
After losing crops, the farmer is happy that he will not have to sleep in the field in the cold.
These stories are about a hundred years ago, but we still feel the same.
K.
Mr. Murlidhar and P.
Today, this library is a way for everyone including tribal children.
The mass movement in Gujarat was a successful experiment.
Millions of people from all ages have participated in this initiative to read books.
In today's digital world, during the time of the Gugul Guru, I have to find you a short time and give you books for some time in your daily duties.
You must write about the reading book on Narendra Modi App and let all the listeners of Mann Ki Bati know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to note that the people of our country are thinking about challenges not only today but also in the future.
I was reading your suggestions in the Narendra Modi App and MyGov... and I saw a lot of people writing about the problem of water.
Besides Pawan Gaurai in Balgavi, Sithanshuman Parida in Bhubaneswar, many others have written to me about water related challenges.
Water has great significance in our culture.
You bless yourself as a mother and grace on us.
The deficiency of water affects many parts of the country every year.
You will be surprised to know that the water available throughout the year is only 8 per cent.
Just 8 percent.
It's time to find peace for this problem.
We will find peace in this matter with the participation of people like other issues, with the strength of the people, with the capacity, cooperation and determination of one crore 30 million people.
The new Jal Shakti Ministry has been designed in the country with the highest importance of water.
This will enable all water related problems to be resolved.
A few days ago, I decided to do something different.
I wrote a letter to the villagers across the country.
I wrote that in order to save water, to save water, to save water and not to lose every rain, the meeting of the people of the village was called and thought with the villagers.
I am glad that they have done this thing and laboured millions of people in thousands of panchayats on the 22nd of this month.
The people of the villages resolved to conserve every water.
Today, at Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you the story of a Sarpanch.
Listen to what message the Grammukh of Lupung Panchayat of Katakmandi Block in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has been given to all of us: "My name is Shri Kumar Ravidas. When Prime Minister wrote a letter to us for water conservation, we did not believe that the Prime Minister wrote such a letter to us.
The people there are ready to play their active role in water conservation once again.
I convey my best wishes to all the villagers and all the villagers for their enthusiasm.
The people of the village are now competing to build a temple for water in their villages.
Like I said, we can make a positive change through social efforts.
In order to address the problem of water, there is no synonym of water all over the country.
For this, efforts are being made in different ways in different parts.
But everyone's goal is the same - it's water, water conservation.
Drinking lines are improving in Punjab.
This effort will help in preventing the problem of water.
The construction of tanks in Thimaipur, Telangana has transformed the lives of rural people.
Small ponds built in the agricultural land in Kabirdham in Rajasthan are making a big change.
I read about a social initiative in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women gathered to revive the river Nag.
They also read about the women of Gwall who have worked well for harvesting rain water.
I am convinced that if we work together, we can make the impossible possible by making strong efforts.
When people gather together, water will be waited.
I say that water is touching, touching the touching water will create a new life.
One Water Conservation Movement will be organized to protect every drop of water.
It will also enable water related problems and propagate water conservation systems.
I urge the remarkable personalities of various fields to take different propagandas for water conservation.
People associated with films, sports, media, social organisations, people associated with cultural organisations, stories and singers, all of them must lead this gathering in their own way.
We can awaken the society, unite the society and join the society.
Look, we can see changes on our eyes.
I urge all of you to share knowledge about the traditional methods of water conservation.
If any of you had the opportunity to go to Porbandar, the birthplace of the venerable father, then you should see another house behind the father's house, where there is a 200-year-old water storage in which there is still water.
There is an arrangement for stopping rain water.
I always say that all those who visit Kirti Mandir must see the reservoir.
There will be various types of water reservoirs at various places.
Distribute information about sharing you with the help of Janshakti4alShakti Hash Tag.
My dear countrymen, I would like to thank you in one respect and thank the people of the world.
Everyone, as the sun rises in every corner of the world, if the lovers of Yoga welcome the sun, then it is a journey till the sun sets.
Throughout the world, the Prime Minister, the famous people and the common man showed how they celebrated Yoga in their country.
That day the world looks like a very happy family.
We all know that healthy and sensitivity persons are required to build a healthy society and Yoga is ensuring that.
Therefore, propagating Yoga is an important thing related to social service.
Isn't such a service to be accepted and respected
It was a matter of great pleasure for me to announce the Prime Minister's Award for those who have played an important role in promoting and promoting Yoga in 2019.
You cannot imagine how important they have played in promoting Yoga.
Japan Yoga Niketan is conducting several institutes and training courses.
Italy's Miss.
We have a very inspiring example.
If this is a matter related to Yoga then can the Indians stand behind
The Bihar Yoga Vidyalaya in Munger has also been honoured and has been working dedicated to Yoga for the last decade.
Likewise, Swami Rajarshi Muni was also honoured and established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
Yes, yes.
I'll wait for your suggestions.
It's a great journey for me to join your thoughts. Mann Ki Baat is only for me.
Come on, let's sit together, let's share thoughts.
I'm listening to your mind, I'll keep it safe, I'll understand it.
Sometimes we can try to live with your emotions.
Your blessings must be.
You are my inspiration, you are my energy.
Come together and share the joy of 'Mann Ki Bati' and fulfill the responsibilities of life.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
Namaskar, the beloved countrymen of the 53th legacy.
These brave heroes sacrificed themselves for 165 crore Indians.
Our brave sons waited for the night to sleep peacefully.
At the same time, the attackers responded in their own language.
You have seen how the attack took place within 100 hours.
The army is determined to root out terrorists and those who help them.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, the response of their families was seen through mediums, which is enhancing the enthusiasm of the entire country.
The feelings expressed by the father of the brave Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur in Bihar at this time are inspiring to all of us.
The nation salutes the unprecedented courage of the wife of the martyrdom of Prasanna Saheb of Jagatsinghpur in Odisha.
He promised to join the CRPF as the only son in his own.
This feeling is seen in every house of our brave and brave martyrs.
I want to tell the youngsters that the feelings of these families should know their minds and try to understand.
This is an inspiration for the future of a bright India.
My dear countrymen, during this long period of independence, we all are waiting for the war memorial.
It is natural to have curiosity and enthusiasm among the people in this regard.
On the Narendra Modi App, Shri Omkar Shetty is happy to commemorate the National War Memorial in Karnataka.
I felt surprising and painful that there was no longer a national war memorial in India.
A war memorial was required to consolidate the sacrifices of the brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the nation.
I decided to have a memorial like that.
I am glad that the National War Memorial will be decided and completed in such a short span of time.
Tomorrow, on 25th February, millions of our countrymen will deliver this National Military Memorial to our forces.
The country will make a small effort to repay debt.
This new memorial is built near the heart of Delhi i.e. Bharatgate and Amar Jawan Jyoti.
I am confident that our people will go to this national military memorial will be equivalent to visit a pilgrimage.
The National Military Memorial is a symbol of the gratitude of the nation for the great martyrs of the country after independence.
The design of the memorial shows the immense courage of our brave soldiers.
The National Military Memorial has been designed in three categories, including the journey from birth to martyrdom of every soldier.
The volcano of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyrs.
The second chakra shows the courage and courage of the soldiers.
This circular shows the martyrdom of the soldiers.
The names of the greatest martyrs for the country are recorded in golden letters.
After that, the protector's cycle shows security.
In this circumambulation, there is a queue of dense trees.
In October last year, I got the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
It was also a reflection of the thinking that the country should be grateful to the men and women police who have been working tirelessly for our security.
I am sure you will come to see the National Military Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
Whenever you come, you must share the pictures taken from there in the social media, inspire others to see this sacred place, these memorials.
Friends, My dear countrymen, I have received thousands of letters and suggestions for Mann Ki Baat through various media.
On March 3, Jamshedji Tata's birthday.
Both individuals from different family backgrounds have enriched the tradition and history of Jharkhand.
In a way, paying homage to Birsa Munda and Jamshedji Tata through Mann Ki Baat is like a glorious history and tradition of Jharkhand.
These two great personalities have not only increased the talent of Jharkhand but also the entire country.
People are grateful for their contribution to the entire nation.
Do you know why the British followed the path of bravery
Because even the Englishmen who had built such a great empire were afraid of him.
Birsa Maa used his traditional ambush and wildlife to capture the British regime using guns and cannons.
Birsa is not only fighting the British for national independence but also for the social and economic freedom of the tribals.
He did this in his younger lifetime.
He brightened the sun in the dark life of the deprived and exploited.
He sacrificed his soul at the age of 25.
The brave sons of India like Birsa Munda have been born in all parts of the country.
There will not be any corner of this century-long freedom struggle, nor any corner of India.
Individuals like Birsa Munda make us aware of our existence, personalities like Jamshedji Tata presented to big institutions to the country.
He knew that India needs scientific technologies and it should be an industrial hub.
Today, the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science called the Indian Institute of Science was a result of his vision.
Not only this, he also established global level institutions and industries like Tata Steel.
The visit between Jamshedji Tata and Swami Vivekananda is in the ship during the US visit.
It is said that this discussion has come to establish the Indian Institute of Science.
Dear countrymen, the birth of former Prime Minister of our country, Morarji Bhai Deshai was on February 29.
As you all know, this day comes once in four years.
Morarjibhai was one of the top leaders of the country, the master of the brilliant, peaceful personality.
Morarjibhai has got the privilege of presenting the budget for the first time in the Parliament of Independence.
In the name of this, he had to pay for old age.
The then government arrested him and punished him.
However, in 1977, when he won the Janta Party election, he became the Prime Minister of the country.
The Amendment of the 44th Amendment provides for the procedures of the Parliament and the Parliament to be published in the papers.
The Amendment envisages re-establishment of certain powers of the Supreme Court and not to abrogate the fundamental rights obtained by Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution even during the period of consequences.
As the Cabinet has written, the President should not be declared an emergency and the term of emergency will not extend once more than six months.
In 1975, it ensured that the death of democracy was not repeated in the future.
The next generation will remember his great contribution in maintaining the greatness of Indian democracy.
Once again I pay homage to the great leader.
Friends, People are enthusiastic about the Padma Awards every year.
They are making positive changes in the lives of others in different ways through their hard work.
It was a great deal to bring a rare painting to the new generation.
I gave gifts to former US President Barack Peak, the artefact of the Tree of Life built by Abdul Gafur.
Among the awardees, Shabbir Said Gomata of Marathwada is known as the servant of the Padma Awards.
You will be surprised to hear about the Tao Porchon-ynch in America, Lynch is now a big institution for Yoga.
It is a specialty that they have tried to connect technology to agriculture. Dear people, 12 of those awarded the Padma Awards this year are the farmers.
Normally, a few people associated with the agriculture sector have come to the list of Padmashree.
The present transformation is a living picture of India.
My dear countrymen, today I am going to tell you something heartfelt and I understand it for the past few days.
Brothers and sisters, In the last five months, about 12 lakh poor families have got the benefit of this scheme.
I have seen how big it has brought about in the lives of the poor.
If you don't know anybody who doesn't want to treat him because of lack of money, then tell them about this scheme.
This scheme is for the poor and dear people, the exam time is going to start in schools.
In the next few weeks across the country, examinations of different education boards, 10th class and 12th class will be started.
I convey my heartfelt greetings to all the students who are going to write the examination, their guardians and all the teachers.
A few days ago, a large programme of exam paper discussion was held at the Town Hall in Delhi.
In this townhold programme, I have been able to interact with millions of students, parents and teachers from across the country with the help of technology.
Through the radio, I'm talking to millions of families every month.
I think you're part of my family when you're talking to you and reading your letters and listening to the suggestions you send through the phone.
It gives me a very pleasant feeling.
Friends, Elections are the biggest festival in democracy.
I'll tell you Mann Ki Baat for years.
Once again, I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.
Mann Ki Baat January 2019
A very sad news was received by the country on 21st of this month.
Dr. Sri Sri Sri Shivakumar Swamiji of Siddhaganga Math in Tumkur district of Karnataka became Divang.
Shivakumaraswamy had dedicated his life to social service.
Bhagwan Basaveshwar has taught us - Kayakave Kailas, that is, to work hard and perform his duties is equal to Lord Shiva's residence in Kailas.
Shivakumar Swamiji was a follower of this vision.
He worked for the social, educational and economic upliftment of thousands of people during his 111 years of life.
He was renowned as a scholar in English, culture and Canada languages.
He was a social reformer.
He worked throughout his life to provide food, home, education and spiritual knowledge to the people.
His priorities were good for the farmers.
The Siddhaganga monastery was regularly organising the Animal-Karshika Melas.
I have been fortunate to get the blessings of Lord Swamiji.
On this occasion, Kalam Saheb spoke a poem about Pujaya Swamiji.
Once again I pay homage to that Mahatma.
Dear countrymen, on January 26, 1950, the Constitution was formed in our country.
That day our country is for the Republic.
Yesterday, we celebrated Republic Day in Kenkema.
But I want to tell you something else.
25th January was the founding day of the Election Commission, which is being celebrated as National Convention Day as National Voters Day.
People from all over the world are surprised to see the huge election process in India.
It is natural for the citizens of our country to be proud of the Election Commission.
In the Gir forest of Gujarat, it must have been heard that Polling Buddha is for only one voter.
This is the beauty of our democracy.
I congratulate the Election Commission for constantly striving to strengthen our democracy.
Congratulations the Election Commission, security officers and other members of all the States for ensuring independent and independent elections that participate in the polling process.
This year, Lok Sabha elections will be held in our country.
This will be the first time that the youth born in the 21st century will use their vote in the Lok Sabha elections.
They have got the opportunity to reinforce the responsibility of the country.
They're going to decide the division of the country.
It's time to connect our dreams with the dreams of the country.
I urge the younger generation to register as a voter if it is the age of voting.
At the same time, we have to think it is our duty to vote.
If you don't vote for any reason in life, then you should feel very painful.
I'm sorry to see something wrong happening in the country.
Our country is a great Vasundhara.
One of those great personalities was Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.
On January 23, the whole country celebrated his birth anniversary in a different way.
On the birth anniversary of Netaji, I got the opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to the brave martyrs who had played a role in India's freedom.
Since independence in the Red Fort, some rooms and buildings were locked up till date.
These locked rooms of the Red Fort have become a beautiful museum today, a museum dedicated to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.
Every stone of this museum has a smell of our glorious history.
Everywhere in the museum reflects the stories of the heroes of our freedom struggle and inspires us to go to history.
At the same place, the British administration had filed a case against the brave sons of India - Colonel Prem Sahgal, Colonel Gur Baksh Dhilan and Major General Shahnawas Khan.
I had to keep the hat in the museum itself and the visitors would like to see the hat from which the inspiration of patriotism is inspired.
However, the bravery and patriotism of our leaders must be repeated to the new generation in different ways.
A month ago, on December 30, I went to Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
I flagged off a tri-coloured flag at a place where 75 years ago Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose flagged off.
Likewise, everybody would be surprised when the tri-coloured flag hoisted in the Red Fort in October 2018, because there was a regular flag hoisting ceremony on 15th August.
Now it was the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Azad Hind Government.
Dilli Chalo, Tume Khun Do, Mym Tume Azadi Dunga (Go to Delhi, give me blood, I will give you freedom) and so on, Netaji took place in the heart of all Indians.
In the last few years, the need for providing the files related to Netaji to the public was increasing.
I'm glad I could do that.
I remember the day when the families of Netaji came together to the Prime Minister's residence.
We spoke about Netaji and paid homage to Netaji Subhash Bose.
I am glad that I have tried to develop several places related to the great people of India in Delhi.
Be it 26 Alipur road related to Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Sardar Patel Museum or Kranti Mandir will be happy.
If you come to Delhi, you must go to see these places.
Dear countrymen, today when we talk about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, it is also Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell you a story related to Netaji's life.
He also chose radio to interact with the people and in 1942, Subhash Babu Azad Hind Radio started.
I understand that this radio station was broadcast every week in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Pashto and Urdu languages.
The Radio Station was inaugurated by Gujarati M.
R.
Vyas played an important role.
Ordinary people liked the programmes launched in Azad Hind Radio.
These programmes were encouraging the warriors of freedom struggle.
The museum is also organised in this Kranti Mandir.
The Indian art and culture have tried to describe in a very attractive manner.
There are four historical exhibitions in the museum where more than 450 paintings and other artefacts of three centuries old have been installed.
The museum showcases the excellent works of great artists like Amrita Shergil, Raja Ravi Varma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandlal Bose, Jamini Rai and Sailos Mukherjee.
I specially urge you all to go there, to see the writings of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
You might be wondering why I'm telling you about the art of Gurudev Tagore's great scriptures.
You might have known Gurudev as a writer about Rabindranath Tagore and as a musician.
He has drawn pictures of animals and birds, and has drawn a lot of natural scenes, and he has discovered human nature and art in Kanvas.
It is worth mentioning that Gurudev did not name many of his writings.
He used to think that those who see the pictures he used to understand the paintings that he had given in it should be known through his own vision.
His pictures are displayed in European countries, Russia and America.
Our great personalities have conveyed the message of harmony, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and actions.
It was a great great saint Ravidas.
February 19 is the birth anniversary of Saint Ravidas.
The Dohas of Saint Ravidas ji are very famous.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy land of Varanasi.
Through his message, he tried to convince the importance of the people who have been working and working throughout his life.
Several young scientists of the country have contributed to our space programmes.
Today, we are proud that our students have developed satellites and sounding rockets are vibrant.
On January 24, the art set of our students was launched.
In Odisha, the sounding rockets made by students have also been set up.
Space Missions have been launched in the last four years from the country's independence to 2014.
We have set up a world record of launching 104 satellites through the same environmental yan.
We will soon be going to ensure the presence of India in the moon through Chandrayaan-2.
Our country uses space technologies to protect the lives and property of the people.
Whether it is climate change or railways or road safety, there is a lot of help from space technology in all.
Naval equipment has been distributed among our fishermen brothers, which is helpful in economic growth along with their security.
We use space technologies to bring government services to the people and to ensure its responsibilities effectively.
Around 40 lakh houses in 23 states have been tagged under the Housing for All, which means Housing for All.
Moreover, nearly three and a half crore earthquakes have been tagged under Manrega.
Our satellites are today a symbol of the growing power of the country.
Through our Competitive Satellite Launch Service, India is launching not only of developing countries but also of developing countries.
The sky and stars are always attractive for the children.
Our space programmes are an opportunity to think of children bigger and go beyond the limits that have been considered impossible till now.
This is also the vision of watching stars for our children and inspiring to find new stars.
In January, 6,000 sportspersons participated in 18 Khelo India Youth Games held in Pune.
This time, in Khelo India, sportspersons from all the states have performed well in their own way.
The life of many medal winners is a strong inspiration.
I read that young sportsperson Akash Gorkha won a silver medal in Gusti, and I read that the father of the sky was working as a guardian at a complex in Pune.
He lives in a parking shed with his family.
In the same way, the Under 21 Women's Cabdi team captain Sonali Helvi of Maharashtra is a person living in Satara.
They lost their father at a very young age and brother and mother encouraged Sonali's ability.
It is usually seen that girls will not be encouraged to participate in sports like Kabadi.
But Sonali chose the clubs and showed the best performance.
Asansol's 10-year-old Abhinav Shah is a Gold medal winner at the youngest age of Khelo India Youth Games.
A farmer's daughter in Karnataka won a gold medal in Akshata Baswanikarmati Vehicle.
When we talk about the creation of India, we should remember that youth is the vision of New India.
These stories of Khelo India should not only contribute to the creation of New India but also to the youth, children and young sports skilled people from small towns, villages and villages.
My dear countrymen, you must have heard a lot of beauty festivals you have named.
Did you hear about the beauty of the toilet
More than 50,000 toilets have participated in this unique competition that has been held for nearly a month.
I urge all Sarpanches and villagers to lead this movement in their Panchayats.
Photo Milathar of your Swachh Beautiful Toilet must be shared in the media.
Friends, On October 2, 2014, we started a memorable journey to make the country waste free and open defecation free.
My young friends, the days of the exam are coming closer.
Ansul Sharma, a resident of Himachal Pradesh, wrote in MyGov. I want to talk about examinations and exam warriors.
Ansul ji thanks for bringing this topic into account.
Yes, for many families, the first part of the year is the exam season.
Today, Mann Ki Baat wanted to discuss this issue, but two days later on January 29, at 11 a.m., the exam paper discussion will be held to the students across the country. This time parents and teachers will participate in the discussion.
This time, students from other countries are also participating in the event.
In this exam paper discussion, I will talk to young friends about all aspects related to the examination, especially stress free exams.
Some of these suggestions and suggestions will definitely be placed in front of you during this event in the Town Hall.
You must participate in this program.
You'll see it temporarily delivered through the media or the Namo App Ludeo.
Dear countrymen, January 30 is the memory of the revered father.
The Prime Minister will pay homage to the martyrs across the country on 11.
We must pay homage to the witnesses of two minutes everywhere.
Remembering the revered Bapu, fulfilling his dreams, building a New India and doing his duties as a citizen.
This journey of 2019 will be successfully taken forward.
Congratulations to all of you. Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, 2018
Dear countrymen, greetings.
2018 is going to end.
We're entering by 2019.
Naturally, we will also hear the discussions on the years to come with the discussions of the past year.
Whether it is the life of a person or social life or the life of a nation, everybody has to look back and try to look forward as much as possible.
This is the result of the achievements of experiences and the confidence of doing many new things.
Besides bringing about changes in our lives, what can we contribute to taking forward the country and the society
My best wishes to all of you for 2019.
As a result of the vision of the people of the country, the scale of sanitation is progressing 95.
For the first time since independence, the Red Fort rose to the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
The President of India has received the Champions of the Arth Award, the highest environmental recognition of the United Nations.
Indias efforts in the field of solar and climate change have been recognized globally.
International Solar Alliance (ISA) was the first edition of International Solar Alliance (ISA) in India.
Our country has achieved unprecedented excellence in the Ease of Doing Business Ranking.
Our daughters have enhanced the pride of the country by putting the world in the navy sagar cycle.
The country's first waterway started in Varanasi.
Through this, a new revolution has been started in the waterways sector.
The longest railway-road bridge in the country was dedicated to the nation, the Bogibeel Bridge, which started in Pakyong, the first airport in Sikkim and the country's 100th airport.
Under 19 Cricket World Cup and Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time India won a lot of medals in the Asian Games.
India has played a very good role in Para Asian Games.
Our Mann Ki Baat in 2019 will continue to be long as we start listing all the social efforts of India.
All this is possible by the unforgettable efforts of 130 crore people.
I am confident that this journey of India's progress and progress will continue in 2019 and our country will scale new heights.
My dear countrymen, we lost some of our distinguished relatives in this December.
Dr. Jayachandran was known as the poorest treater.
Similarly, on December 25, Sulagiti Narasama died in Karnataka.
Sulagiti Narasama was a pregnant mother and sister who helped delivery.
They have provided services to thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in the remote areas.
There are many inspirations like Jaichandra and Sulagiti Narasama.
They have dedicated their lives for the welfare of everyone in the society.
When we talk about healthcare, I would like to tell you about the work done by doctors in Bijnor, North India.
Some party workers told me last day that some young doctors in the city were camping and treating the poor.
Heart Lungs Critical Centre, where medical camps are conducted every month, there are arrangements for various diseases, free tests and treatment.
Today, hundreds of patients are using this camp every month.
The enthusiasm of these doctors who are selflessly serving should definitely be complimented.
Today, I can proudly say that the Swachh Bharat Mission has been a successful campaign through social efforts only.
A few days ago, some people told me that more than three lakh people were involved in sanitation work in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
City Corporation, Services Institutions, School and College students and all the people of Jabalpur were enthusiastically involved in this campaign for cleanliness.
I'm the Betterindia.
Whenever I get the opportunity, I am definitely trying to know about such inspirations by going to the Betterindia.com.
I am glad that many such websites introduce us to many stories that inspire us to live with specialties.
com is trying to promote positivity in the site society and make the society more sensitive.
Similarly, yoursty.com Young innovators and the stories of the success of the entrepreneurs are very much telling us.
Please fucking positivity and virus.
I am confident that more and more people are aware of our heroes who bring about changes in the society.
It's very easy to spread the negative.
However, we have a lot of good things in our society, all this is possible through the collective efforts of 130 crore people.
Hana is 12 years old and lives in Anantnag in Kashmir.
Hanna practiced hard work and compassionately, learning about its various dimensions, demonstrated himself.
I wish them a bright future for all the people of the country.
My best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, there was a lot of discussion on the media about 16-year-old child and Rajni.
You must have read.
Rajni Junior women won gold medal at Gusti Championship.
As soon as the Rajni medal was won, the child went to the nearby milk shop and drank a glass of milk.
After that, Rajni medal was covered in a cloth and put in a bag.
You think why Rajni drank a glass of milk.
The kid did it, the father was honouring Jasmersingh and he was selling lussi at a stall in the snake.
Rajni said that the father had to bear a lot of sacrifices and suffered a lot in bringing the child to this level.
Jasmer Singh goes to work in the morning before Rajan and his brothers wake up.
When Rajni told her father the desire to learn boxing, her father organised all possible things and encouraged her enthusiasm.
Rajini's wrestling training took the old glasses because at that time the financial condition of the family was very bad.
Even after all these obstacles, Rajni was not enthusiastic and had to learn wrestling.
He won a medal from Serbia.
This month, the 20-year-old Vedangi Kulkarni of Pune has become the fastest growing man in the world in the cycle.
The child travelled 300 kilometers a day in a cycle of 159 days.
The zeal of the child is surely complimented for driving the bike.
We don't get inspiration by listening to such achievements.
My best wishes to our farmer brothers and sisters.
The aroma of emotions like unity in diversity and Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat is filled with our festivals.
In Indian culture, there is no distinction of society and nature, where individuals and society are the same.
Calendar, Panchangam, based on festivals, is a good example of our close relationship with nature.
It will also provide information about the status of planets and stars along with festivals throughout the year.
It's decided to follow who follows the calendar.
Festivals and festivals are celebrated on the basis of planets in different areas.
Gudi Padwa, Chedichand and Ugadi are celebrated according to the lunar calendar, while Tamil Putan, Vishnu, Vaishakham, Baisakhi, Poela Baisak and Bihu are celebrated on the basis of the sun calendar.
In many of our festivals, the vision of protecting rivers and water is particularly inclusive.
The Chhath Festival is related to sun-prasana in rivers and lakes.
On the occasion of Makar Sankranti, millions and millions of people drown in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals and festivals teach us the lessons of social values.
On the one hand, they have an archaeological significance, on the other hand, all the festivals inspire each other to live in the lessons of life and inspire each other to live in harmony.
I extend my best wishes to all of you for 2019 and wish you all to celebrate the coming festivals with a full heart.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
People from all over the country come and participate in the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh is a crowd of faith and devotion.
Together, millions of people from across the country and abroad join together.
The tradition of Kumbh is spread over our great cultural heritage.
This time, from January 15, you will probably be waiting for the world famous Kumbh celebrated in Prayagraj.
Saint-Mahatmal has already started reaching for the Kumbh Mela.
It is a great evidence that UNESCO is involved in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity to develop global significance.
A few days ago, the Ambassadors of several countries saw preparations for the Kumbh.
There the national flags of many countries have been raised.
The Kumbh in Prayagraj will be attended by people from over 150 countries.
This is a great study, especially for the youth.
I went to Prayag Raj a few days ago, and I saw preparations for the Kumbh being enthusiastic.
This time there is a lot of importance in sanitation.
It will be cleaned with devotion and the message will reach far and wide.
This time devotees can also visit Akshayvad after the sacred bath at the confluence.
This Akshayavat, a symbol of the belief of the people, was closed in the fort for centuries, so the devotees could not see even if they wished.
This time everybody has been allowed to enter there.
You all must participate in the Kumbh Mela and share pictures of different levels in the society, so that more and more people can get inspiration to go to Kumbh.
May the spiritual Kumbh be the greatest philosophy of Indian philosophy.
May the Kumbh of faith be the greatest pillar of nationality.
May the Kumbh of artistics be the greatest of creative powers.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of enthusiasm in the minds of the people about the Republic Day celebrations held on 26th January and remembers the great personalities that we have formed our Constitution.
This year we are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of the revered father.
President of South Africa, Mr.
Sirial Ramaphosa is visiting India as the Chief Guest on Republic Day this year.
There was an unparalleled relationship between revered Bapu and South Africa.
Mohan, the Mahatma was from Africa in this direction.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started his first Satyagraha and remained firmly opposed to diversity.
He established Phoenix and Tolstoy Farms from where the confluence of peace and justice all over the world was driven.
He had the power and inspiration to live in jail for so many years.
He wrote about Mandela Bapu, "Mahatma is an integral part of our history because here he started testing tests.
This is where he showed his determination for justice, where he developed the vision and fighting methods of Satyagraha.
He saw Bapu as a roll model.
Bapu and Mandela are not only a source of inspiration throughout the world, but their ideals always inspire us to create a society full of love and compassion.
Friends, Just a few days ago, a conference of DGPs was held on the banks of Narmada in Gujarat, where the Statue of Unit is the highest statue in the world.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the nation.
He always lived in maintaining India's integrity.
Sardar Saheb thought that India's strength depends on its diversity.
Respecting Sardar Sabs vision and paying homage to him with this award for unity.
Dear countrymen, January 13 is the holy day of the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.
Guru Govind Singh ji was born in Patna.
His workplace was North India for a long time and he shot his life in Namded in Maharashtra.
Janmabhoomi in Patna, Karmabhoomi North Bharat, the last moment of life in Namded.
In a way, he received his blessings throughout the year.
After Gurutej Bahadur ji became a martyr, Guru Gobind Singh ji became a Guru at the young age of 9 years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had the courage to fight for justice as a tradition from Sikh Gurus.
He was the owner of a peaceful and comfortable personality, but whenever an attempt was made to suppress the voices of the poor and the weak, Guru Gobind Singh ji raised his voice to the poor and the weak at noon, that's why he said.
He was a Divya Purushan with valour, valour, sacrifice and religion.
He had unnatural weapons and science.
As a warrior, Gurumukhi, Brajbhasha, Sanskrit, Parsi, Hindi, Urdu and other languages were known.
I once again bow down to Guru Gobind Singh.
My dear countrymen, there are many good events in the country, but there is no detailed discussion about them.
At the Right India Movement, Health Travels are organised across the country.
The programme will be held till 27th January.
It is commendable that I have been trying to create awareness and knowledge among the people across it.
India should be prosperous only when it is clean.
Nutrition is the most important for good health .
Initiated in this matter.
It is important to learn lessons about the importance of food in childhood.
Come, let's move forward to achieve new heights for new accomplishments with new inspiration, enthusiasm and determination. Let's move forward, change ourselves and change the country.
In MyGov, Anshukumar from Delhi, Amar Kumar from Delhi and Vikas Yadav from Patna, Monica Jean from Delhi, Presenjit Government from Bardwan in West Bengal, Sangeeta Scientist from Nagpur and others asked about the same question.
They say people are usually connected to you through modern technology, social media and mobile apps.
I want to tell you a story.
It took place in 1998.
I was working as an organizational worker of Bharatiya Janata Party in Himachal Pradesh.
May was the month.
It was a little Dad.
I don't understand anything.
Seeing my response, he said, look, Sab, listen to the radio.
Next time, the skies made a survey about Manki Baat.
Some of them are very funny.
Average 70 of the surveyors are regularly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
Most people feel that Mann Ki Baat has grown positive thinking in the society.
Many people have been encouraged by Mann Ki Baat.
There were extensive discussions about India Positive.
I am glad to see the radio becomes more popular because of Mann Ki Baat.
If the leader gets a mike, millions and millions of people have to hear and what do you want
They discovered that there was no politics in this program.
As soon as the Mann Ki Baat was started, it was decided that it should not be the benefits of the government and that Modi should not be there.
The most inspired in implementing my determination was from you.
Small stories of 130 crore people will always remain.
With the inspiration and enthusiasm of this country, it will reach new heights.
When I read the letter, a sort of emotion in my mind and shape, it curtails.
With two words, I share it with my experience to you.
When will a government get the strength to motivate not only across the country and abroad, starting the Selfie seed dollar programme in a small village in Haryana
The well-known celebritisers of all sections of the society have joined together and have reflected the thoughts of the society and created awakening in the new language that the present generation understands.
Mann Kibat is not the matter of the government, it is the matter of society.
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India.
India's life is not political and not political.
The life of India is social justice and social power.
There are thousands of heads in social life, one of them is political.
If everything is political, it's not a good arrangement for the society.
Sometimes political events, political events and other talents in the society, and their goals.
Thank you very much for the phone call.
In fact, Mann Ki Baat is an easy thing for me.
People's letters come before every Mann Ki Baat.
I'm trying to see maximum letters before Mann Ki Baat and read commands.
A lot of phone calls are heard.
I read very carefully the ideas and inputs you are sending during the journey as Mann Kibat's epidemic approaches.
So whenever you read a letter, the ecosystem of a writer, his mind's emotions, becomes part of my thoughts.
That letter is not a piece of paper for me.
For the last 40-45 years, I have spent a long time in the remote districts of the country and have spent most of the districts of the country.
Efforts are also being made to pay attention to the relevant departments of Unincorporated letters in Mann Ki Baat.
I would like to thank my friends from Akashwani, FM Radio, Doordarshan, other TV channels and media.
Their efforts have made Mann Ki Baat reach more and more people.
The team of Akashwani prepares all the episods to be broadcast in many languages.
Some people hear Mann Ki Baat with the same emotion in the voice of Modi in the local language.
So they're becoming Modi for the 30-minute time.
I congratulate and thank them for their talent and skill.
I urge you all to hear this programme in local languages.
I would like to thank the friends of the media who have heard Mann Ki Baat every month in their channels.
No political person is satisfied with the media, they feel that they can get a little coverage, only if they get the coverage then it is a negative coverage.
If you had no cooperation, this journey of Mann Ki Baat would have been incomplete.
I'm gonna do it in every family.
It's easy to understand if we don't come in the middle of the old shores of our own life.
One doesn't understand that he left his thoughts and accepted the thoughts of the innocent.
The specialty of today's youth is that they don't do self-confidence, if they believe in something, they leave it and follow it.
Sometimes people talk about ideological discourse with the youth in their families.
In fact, the limit of talking to most families and youth is very narrow.
Do so about long learning things, habits, lifestyles, and do not do it.
I have been trying to constantly interact with the youth through various programmes.
I'm trying to learn from them what they do, what they think.
They always have a treasure of ideas.
They are very energetic, innovative and focusing.
Through Man Kiba, I am trying to link the problems of the youth and their affairs more.
Sometimes there is a complaint that the youth are asking more questions.
I'm saying it's good for the youth to ask questions.
We feel that today's youth is very ambitious and thinks a lot of things.
It is very good to see big dreams and achieve great achievements. It is ultimately a New India.
Some say that the youth want to do a lot of things at the same time.
I'm asking what's wrong with this.
Several things are done at the same time, because they are capable of multi-tasking.
If we look around the environment, it is social initiatives, start-ups, sports or other areas, the youth are bringing about great changes in the society.
Young people who have the courage to ask questions and see new dreams.
If you bring the thoughts of the youth to the ground, you give them an open environment to show them, you can bring about positive changes in the country and they are doing so.
My dear countrymen, Vineetji of Gurugram has written in MyGov that in this Mann Ki Baat I should tell you about the Constitution Day.
Vineeta says that the day is important because we enter the 70 years of the formation of the Constitution.
Thank you very much for this opinion.
The Constituent Assembly took two years and 11 months and 17 days to complete this historic thing.
Just imagine that within three years this great man gave us such a comprehensive and comprehensive governance structure.
Today's time management and productivity are the examples of which they have created the constitution at such a rapid pace.
This inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities in a record time.
The Constituent Assembly was the confluence of the great talents of the country and all of them were committed to empowering India and giving the Constitution to the nation that empowers the poorest of the poor.
As India completed 60 years of its Republic in 2010, a bright journey was organised by the Constitution on the elephant in Gujarat.
It was an opportunity to recall the creation of the Constitution among the youth and to connect them with various aspects of the Constitution.
By 2020, we will complete 70 years as a Republic and will complete 75 years of our independence in 2022.
Come, let us move forward our Constitutional values and ensure peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
He used to say that Indians are from different backgrounds but we must be a nation beyond all.
India First-India first is Dr.
All the State Governments and Union Territories have proposed to observe this opportunity in a very comfortable manner.
Similarly, it will be celebrated in all the countries of the world.
In addition, a train will also run through the path of holy places related to Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Last day, I remembered the Gurudwara of Lakhpat Saheb while participating in this meeting.
During the 2001 earthquake in Gujarat, the Gurudwara had great losses.
Our journey will continue.
As much as you are connected, our journey will be deeper and pleasure to everyone.
Sometimes there are questions in the mind of some people - What did I get with Mann Ki Baat
Your great wishes are my great wishes...
Come on, let's go ahead with this journey...
October 31 is the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, our beloved one.
Every year, the youth of the country is ready to run for the unity for the unity of the country.
Now the weather is very pleasant.
I urge you all to enthusiastically participate in the Honble Union.
About six and a half months before Independence, the world's most famous internationally famous The Time Magazine released the picture of Sardar Patel in the cover page of Lakshadweep published on 27 January 1947.
They gave a picture of India with the main inscription, which wasn't like we saw today.
It was a picture of India that had been scattered for a long time.
There were over 550 countries at that time.
The interests of the British on India were without.
He said how he did rescue work during the floods in Ahmedabad in 1920s.
It is said how Bardoli gave direction to Satyagraha.
His faith and commitment to the nation was the way from farmers and workers to industrialists to believe him.
On 31st October, the jubilee of Sardar Patel will be more special and this day the Statue of Unity will be dedicated to the nation by paying a true tribute to Sardar Patel.
The height of this statue established on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is double the Statue of Liberty in America.
It's the world's tallest Gagan-surpassing statue.
Every Indian can be proud that the highest statue in the world is Bharat Mann.
Sardar Patel, who is associated with soil, will be decorated to the sky.
Brothers and sisters, Yesterday, we all celebrated Infantry Day.
I salute all those who are part of the Indian Army.
I salute the families of the soldiers and their courage.
But do you know why we, the people of Hindustan, celebrate the Infantry Day
This day the soldiers of the Indian Army were on the soil of Kashmir and waited for the climbers to ruin Kashmir.
This historic event has a direct connection with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an interview with Sam Manek Shah, the great military officer of India.
On that occasion, Field Marshal Manek Shah, remembering the time he was a field marshal.
At that time, in October 1947, the military detention was started to Kashmir.
October 31 is the memory of our former Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi.
Indiraji also paid homage to him.
My dear countrymen, who doesn't like games and sports
Spirit, Strength, Skill and Stamina are important in the world of sports.
It's not the root of any player's success.
The next two meetings were held in memory.
For the first time, the Asian Para Games 2018 held in Jakarta is an opportunity to meet our Para Athletes.
Similarly, there was an opportunity to see the winners of the Summer Youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
Youth Olympics 2018 showcased the best performance of our youth so far.
Out of these, we have 13 medals and 3 medals in Mix Evil.
This is the story of Indian sports that touches new heights every day.
India is creating new records not only in sports but also in areas where no one has thought.
He lost his father when he was eight years old.
He lived in the orphanage for the next eight years.
After leaving the orphanage, DDC buses were cleaned and worked as a waiter on the shores of the roads in Delhi.
Today, in the same Narayan International events, gold medals are being won for India.
Not only this, look at what kind of India has achieved the heights of excellence in sports.
India has never won an Olympic medal in Senior Lovely or Junior Lovely in Judah.
But Tababi goddess Youth Olympics won a silver medal in Judah and made history.
The 16-year-old young sportsperson Tababi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
The child's father is a labourer, mother is fishing.
Sometimes this child's family had a state of no money to buy anything for food.
Even in such an environment, the fort has not been able to encourage Tababi Devi.
And then he won a medal for the country and made history.
There are countless stories like this.
Every life is a source of inspiration.
The enthusiasm of every young sportsperson is on the bottom of New India.
Friends, In 2017, we successfully organised the FIFA Under-17 World Cup.
He congratulated the entire world as a tournament successfully organised.
This year, India has got the privilege of organizing Men's Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will be held from 28th November to 16th December.
In the minds of every Indian, playing any game, interest in any game, there will definitely be a challenge to Hockeyo.
India has conferred great hockey players.
The story of Hockey will be incomplete with these great sportspersons in India whenever the world is discussed.
Hockey magician Major Dhyan Chand is known all over the world.
Thereafter, Hockey travelled from Balwinder Singh Senior, Lesley Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhanraj Pilla.
Even today, team India players inspire the new generation of Hockey through the success of their hard work and dedication.
It is a good opportunity for sports lovers to see thrilling games.
Go to Bhubaneswar and not only increase the enthusiasm of the Indian team but also encourage all teams.
But in the new era, new ways, new generations, new zeal, new zeal, new zeal and new dreams are coming forward today.
Some teach children, some teach adults, some are engaged in sanitation, some help farmers.
There is no desire behind doing all this, but it has dedication, determination and selflessness.
A young man learned to play a wheelchair basketball to help the Wheelchair Basketball team of Divyangjan.
This enthusiasm is the work of this dedication in the mission mode.
Does any Indian feel proud of it
Brothers and sisters, this time when I looked at the suggestions related to Mann Ki Baat, I got to see a very attractive note of Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pondicherry.
He has written in MyGov how the tribals of India and their lifestyles and traditions are the best examples of co-operation with nature.
For sustainable development, we must learn from them what we need to make traditions a part of our lives.
Manish ji, I congratulate you for putting this topic in front of the listeners of Mann Ki Baat.
This is an inspiration for us to look at our glorious past and culture, and today the world and particularly the Western countries are talking about environmental protection and finding new ways for a balanced lifestyle.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship trees, plants and flowers as goddesses.
In the Bhil tribe section of Central India, particularly in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, people worship almonds and palm trees named Arjun.
In the desert like Rajasthan, the Bishnoi community has shown us how to protect the environment.
They don't want to lose their lives especially in protecting trees, but they don't agree to harm even a tree.
It is believed that Mishmis in Arunachal are directly linked to tigers.
They look like their brothers.
People from the Warli community of Maharashtra see tigers as guests and for them the presence of tigers is prosperous.
The Gaud Tribes of Central India are halting fishing in some parts of the Kathan river during fishing period.
They see these areas as a residency of fishes and they get good fishes because of their behaviour.
Toda, a small hut community in the lonely areas of Nilgiri in southern India, is traditionally constructing their houses with the same items available in the region.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in living very peacefully and mutually, but if someone harms their natural resources, they will not fight to protect their rights.
It is not surprising that the people of the tribal community were among our first freedom fighters.
Come on, let's express our respect for them.
Friends, Mann Ki Baat tells about those who do extraordinary things for the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about the farmer brother-in-law of Punjab Bhai Gurubachan Singh.
An ordinary farmer was married to Guru Bachan Singh.
But, you will be surprised to know that a common farmer like Bhai Gurubachan Singh, who told the father of the bride, his relationship that he had taken forward, that is the real power of our society.
Guru Bachan Singh ji told them, I want to promise that no more wickles will burn in the field.
You can imagine how big a social force it has.
It seems simple that Guru Bachan Singh ji said, but how large his personality is, this thing tells us, there are many families in our society that make personal matters a matter of social welfare.
The family of Shriman Gurubachan Singh ji was such an example before us.
I read about Kalar Majra near Naba, another village in Punjab.
The people of Kalar Majra drive the whole ground instead of burning a bike and use technology for it.
Greetings to Bhai Gurubachan Singh.
Congratulations to the people of Kalar Majra and other places who have made great efforts to keep the environment clean.
You live as the real inheritors of the Indian tradition of a healthy lifestyle.
Om Dhoon Shanti , Shanti Prithvi Shanti , Appo Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Vishwadev , Shanti , Brahma , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Shanti , Peace , peace , peace , peace , peace in all the three worlds , peace in water , in the earth , in the sky , in the fire , in the air , in the medicines , in the vegetation , in the vegetation , in the whole Brahmand .
In lifestyles, in heart, in you, in the particles of the world, there is peace everywhere.
For India, the First World War was a big event.
We didn't have a direct connection with the war.
Nevertheless, our soldiers fought bravely, played a very big role, made a great martyrdom.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not behind anybody when it was a matter of war.
In the First World War, the world saw the dragon of destruction.
It is believed that more than one crore soldiers and almost the same common people have given their lives.
Through this, the whole world understood the importance of peace.
In the last hundred years, the definition of peace has changed.
Today peace and harmony is not merely a war.
From terrorism to climate change, economic development and social justice, there is a need to work together with the cooperation and coordination of the world.
The development of the poorest of the poor is a true symbol of peace.
Friends, our North-Eastern region is different.
The natural beauty there is unparalleled and the people there are very talented.
Our north-eastern region is now known for many comforts.
The North-Eastern Region has progressed very well in terms of organic farming.
A few days ago, Kirtiket Future Policy Gold Award 2018 was received to promote sustainable availability of Sikkim.
O. i.e. Food Agricultural Organization is being provided.
The award for best policy formulation in this field is equivalent to Oskar in the region.
Not only this, our Sikkim State has won the award with the following 51 policies proposed by 25 countries.
My best wishes to the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, October is the end of the month.
There are many changes in the climate.
Festivals have also been the period of climate change, in a way like Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhayyaduj, Chhath, the month of November is the month of festivals.
Besides this, your progress is an important part of the country's progress as an opportunity to move forward in a mission mode in your lives.
