New places, new cities, new cities, new villages and new areas.
Then go to another place and give it three to four days there too.
This will give you the opportunity to learn a lot.
I would also hope that whenever you go there, share some photographs with me.
Have you seen new
Thousands of years ago, he campaigned to enter the temple and made them enter the temple.
We are really fortunate that in every era, great men have been born in us to overcome the evils of our society.
In other words, 'Shram is Shiva' and I repeatedly call Shrameb Jayate.
My best wishes and thanks.
In every corner of the country, most of the families will be busy examining their children.
The most interesting thing about Gurudev Rabindranath was that he was not the first person in Asian region to be the Nobel Prize winner in 1913, the British divided him into the Night Point and when the British divided him in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Rabindranath was one of those individuals and great men who died against his voice English government and during this period a small child of 12 years had a deep impact on his mind.
The sight of Jallivanawala Bagh Kyakand played in a childhood in a childhood created a new inspiration and in 1919, that 12-year-old boy-loving Bhagat is the source of inspiration: Shaheed Bhagat Singh.
Before today, on 23rd March, Bhagat Singh had blamed his colleague Sukhdeb and Rajguru with the British government and everyone knows that on 23rd March the incident of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdeb and Rajguru had a sense of satisfaction to serve Mother India on that day - death was not afraid.
He dedicated all the dreams of life to the service of Mother India.
And these three brave martyrs are the source of inspiration today.
We cannot describe the story of the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
There can be a good beginning for India.
In 2022, India will complete 75 years of its independence.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to you today.
We can do this in our daily life.
Look, brothers and sisters, how much pain is in the minds of one of the 11th classes of students.
How many nations are there in his mind after seeing the filth and waste in the same fashion.
I remember this auspicious moment.
I want this thing to be a nation towards cleanliness in the minds of 1. 25 crore Indians.
Once it comes to pass, when there is dissatisfaction, we will start doing something or the other against cleanliness.
It is a good thing that the travellers are spreading their fame, suggesting me and also telling me that they have failed by making a lot of efforts.
I know some of the youngsters who have carried out such campaigns.
The biggest problem was that we did not even know about such incidents around us, even though we were hesitant to talk openly about it.
Whoever feels depression himself does not say anything because he remembers himself.
If he likes not staying alone with you then you will not let it happen.
This is the best way.
It will be the third year.
Millions of collective Yoga festivals should be celebrated.
If you want to give some suggestions about the third International Day of Yoga, you must give me the mobile app and be my guides.
Make sure that the poems and poems that can be used about yoga can be understood easily.
I would like to tell mothers and sisters also one thing because today there is a lot of discussion about health and health.
A few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
The working women in our country, their numbers are increasing day by day, their participation is increasing.
But they have some special responsibilities.
Earlier, the workforce women were given 12 weeks of maternity leave during their pregnancy and now they have been extended to 26 weeks.
Perhaps there are two-three countries in the world who are ahead of us in this direction.
India has taken a very big and important decision for these sisters.
On the Narendra Modi App, through Twitter, in the letter...
Whether it is fighting with poverty, to evacuate poverty, to connect with the world, to spread knowledge or information, technology or science has created a special place for itself.
It is also a matter of great happiness that this is the 38th successful inspiration of PSLV.
This is an important achievement in the defence sector and you will be happy to know that only 4 or 5 countries in the world have this potential.
Two persons have worked very keenly for this and they have developed such a house which can save the house in such a situation.
Our country has received a lot of support in the last few days, the 'Laki Garhwal Yojana', 'DG Dhan Business Scheme'.
More than four thousand businessmen have received awards worth Rs. 40,000.
They are understanding and encouraging with great enthusiasm.
A young friend of Maharashtra, Pooja Nemade, a graduate student, he is also using Rupay Card, e-Allet in his family and telling everyone about how much joy it is.
And the prizes of one lakh rupees are important for him, but he has now adopted this work as a campaign and others are also inspiring for this work.
I urge the people of the country, especially the youth of the country and those who have received the awards under this scheme, Digi-Dhan Business Scheme, to take the leadership of this movement yourself to be the Ambassador of the country.
In a way, you are a sacred person.
This is not just the production of pulses but the biggest service of the poor of my country.
We know that when a citizen of our country does something good, the whole country feels a new energy and the confidence of the country increases.
We all welcomed the exhibition of the disabled people of our country in the Rio Paralympics.
This month, India lost Pakistan in the Under-20 World Cup Cricket Finale, for the second time to become a world champion, enhanced the pride of the country.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons of the team.
The country is proud of this achievement of our disabled friends.
I am very grateful for your partnership.
Therefore, when I talk to you today, I am drawing my sight towards two Mohans.
Today, when we talk about the festival, India is preparing for another big festival.
And it is being discussed not only in India but in the whole world.
We look at his entire life and see that in South Africa, he served the people of those communities who used to discriminate and at that time it was not a common thing.
He served those farmers who were discriminated against Champaran.
He taught service not in language but in his life.
I believe that perhaps 130 crore people would have had imagination and 130 crore programmes.
This is the Nand Lal Bose whose artefacts enhance the beauty of our Constitution.
It provides a new identity to the Constitution.
Once again, congratulating Gandhiji on his 150th birth anniversary, I hope for some resolutions from every Indian.
For the country, for the society and for others, something or the other should be done.
This will be the best, true and honest work towards Bapu.
Friends, You will remember that for the last few years, we have been launching the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign for nearly two weeks before 2nd October.
This time on October 2, when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu, we not only dedicate to him an open defecation free India but also laid the foundation stone of a new mass movement against plastic all over the country.
Mudhai Pashankhandsu Ratnasingh Pradiyat.
This means that water, food and sun are three gems in the earth.
But the poor people call stones as Ratnas.
The glory of food in our culture is very high.
However, we have transformed the knowledge of food into science.
It is essential for women and children, especially because they are the foundations of our future in the society.
Through Poshan Abhiyan, nutrition is being transformed into a mass movement in modern scientific methods across the country.
People are fighting against malnutrition in new and wonderful systems.
Once one thing was brought to me.
This was a very good step that could be done in all the areas.
Friends, There are many such small things that our country can fight malnutrition effectively.
Today the poor families and the rich families are also affected due to lack of awareness.
The Month of September will be celebrated as Poshan Abhiyan across the country.
There was a timely transformation of languages and a small cordles in the ears of Beer Grills.
After this programme, many people have been able to talk about Jim Corbett National Park.
You should also visit places related to nature and wildlife.
I have already told you that you must visit Northeast India once in your life.
On the 15th of August, I had requested you to visit at least 15 places in the next three years.
Last month, I had the opportunity to release the Tiger Report.
The number of tigers in India is now 2967.
But this is a New India, where we have fulfilled the goals very well.
When I had released the Tiger data, I remembered the Gir forests of Gujarat.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the residence of lions in the jungles of Gir was getting constricted.
But now we have to go beyond conservation and think about sensitivity.
We have to keep ourselves healthy and also keep the country healthy.
I know that all these campaigns will also take place in social media.
Let us move forward with a new zeal, a new resolution and a new energy.
I will wait for you and your views.
Let us all move towards defeating the India of the dreams of our freedom fighters and fulfilling the dreams of Gandhiji - Swant: Sukhaya.
Make the joy in ourselves a service and move forward.
Thank you very much.
When I had announced this thing, many teachers, parents and students sent me a message, sent questions, suggested, explained the problems and discussed the problems.
At the time of the festival, the strength of the society is felt.
Sometimes we can see the tests in a proper way.
Lage, it is a question of life and death.
The exams you are going to give are the tests of your reading courses throughout the year.
This is not the test of your life.
You know his experience, his knowledge and his success.
Therefore, the burden of this number is sometimes forced to go right.
Because it is usually a belief that if the students feel like sports, then their attention will be lost by studying.
I don't know whether it would be right for everyone or not, but I have realized that at such a time Deep Breathing will benefit a lot.
Yes, you should take as much sleep as you need, which will not waste your time.
This will help in enhancing reading power.
Your concentration integration will increase.
You will feel temporary.
Your skills will grow in a holistic way.
Whenever I hold an election meeting, my throats fall.
A folk singer came to meet me.
Huh, young friends, you have prepared for testing and I have binded you in mind.
Therefore, as much as I advise your parents not to create a burden, it is also being implemented on me.
Each exam should be performed by an exam.
Thereafter, the test will never be done.
Take this mantra forward.
Mann Ki Baat gives me a great opportunity to connect with you.
My best wishes to Bahu.
It is said in the story that Jesus was standing near the house of a temple.
Today the countrymen are going to get the benefits of two schemes in the form of gifts for a long time.
Two new schemes are going to be started when they say.
In the entire country, whether it is villages or cities, whether it is educational or illiterate, how can cash-free transactions be done without cash, there has been an atmosphere of cruelty.
Therefore, to create e-payment habits, the Government of India is going to launch the Incentive Scheme for consumers and small businesses from today.
In order to encourage the consumers, the scheme is 'Locky Consumer Scheme' and 'Dig Dhan Business Scheme' to promote businesses.
Everyday, 15,000 people will be awarded to write thousands of rupees.
With these 30 crore people, this award will be a partner of the scheme.
In the last few days, cash transactions have increased by 200 to 300.
Countries like India should be at the forefront of this sector.
Our youngsters have made considerable progress in start-ups.
This digital development is a golden opportunity.
Our youngsters, with new ideas and ideas, with new technologies, with new technologies, with new technologies, we have to be associated with the entire campaign to free the country from black money and corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge the people to give their suggestions and their thoughts every month before Mann Ki Baat.
Whenever I saw these things, I am totally aware that these are divided into three parts.
In the coming days, this law will also do its own work.
Whatever we need to do for the benefit of the country and for the welfare of the people is our priority.
As per the investment report, India is ranked third in the potential top economy 2016-18.
The participation of students in such a large number of board tests indicates that our children of Jammu and Kashmir are committed to reaching new heights of development through education.
I congratulate the students for their enthusiasm and congratulations to their parents, their friends, their teachers and the faces of all the villages.
Brothers and sisters, I am aware of the people who have lost their views for Mann Ki Baat this time.
However, when I see your support, I see your cooperation, many efforts are being made to mislead you.
Their capacity was recognized.
Today, once again they have accepted this challenge and I am confident that the commitment of 1. 25 crore Indians and all the consistent efforts will make this nation a new energy.
But the misfortune is so wide that some people still do not have any bad habits.
Some people still feel that the money of this corruption, the amount of black money, the amount of Rs.
They are passing through uninterrupted ways to save their wealth.
The sad thing is that even in this they have liked the way to use the poor.
Some people are trying to save money by misleading the poor, by depositing money in their accounts or by doing some work by them.
A lot of laws have been made for Benami wealth and the systems that are in it will be very difficult.
If there is any problem for the countrymen, the government wants it.
Appreciating the war against corruption and black money announced by Mr. Ashish from Madhya Pradesh, he said in the telephone: "Thank you, thank you, my name can be blessed.
I am a common citizen of Tirali village of Tirali Tahsil in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh.
This is the strength of my country, in which there is the truth of service mood and sacrifice mood.
During the elections, I had a discussion in 'Cha' and it was spread all over the world.
People from many countries of the world were also learned to talk about charity.
There was no festival, no festival, nothing, because there was some financial difficulties due to the shutdown of the note.
The travellers also accepted it as a honour.
Surat's Bharat Maru and Daksa Parmar - they have contributed in the fight against corruption, against black money and inspiring movements that are going on through their marriage.
I bless the newly married Bharat and Daksa and congratulate them for changing the occasion of marriage into this great yagna and transforming it into a new occasion.
Friends, You are my true soldier.
I am very well aware that you all are active in this great cause.
Once the poor people will bless you with the use of RuPay cards.
He told the ordinary citizen that even though he would be free from all concerns.
I believe that if all the youngsters of India are engaged in this work then it will not take much time.
In a month, we will be able to stand in the form of a new modern India before the world.
We will take this struggle to free the country from corruption and black money.
The people from afar will feel that the life of Indians is the name of the festival and it is natural.
The shadow of darkness in the Deepawali community, the darkness of the wickedness in the person, the redemption of the darkness of the wicked is the festival of Deepawali's Deepawali.
One thing we all know well that if we visit anywhere in India, go to the house of the richest of the rich, go to the poorest of the poor, on the occasion of Deepawali, cleanliness campaigns are going on in every family.
I mean to say that the festival of light is going to be a source of inspiration for the people of Deepawali from darkness to light.
When we celebrate Diwali, somebody stands in the land, somebody is engaged in the security of the Himalayas, somebody is protecting the airport.
Apart from this, I would like to say that along with the army officers and soldiers, his family also sacrifices a lot.
In a way, the entire army is getting very good messages and I would like to give you an appy diwali.
My dear countrymen, it is true that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are not only on the border but also in every field of life.
It is a need of time to fulfil the expectations that have been created among the poor people of the country.
In the 21st century, the darkness in the village is no longer like this.
Sardar Saheb has given us an India and all our responsibility is to defeat it as a Best India.
The basic mantra of unity creates a strong foundation of the best India.
Sardar Saheb was not only a person in the struggle but also a creative person.
On this Ekta Diwas, we will be committed to remembering Sardar Saheb and unity wherever we are on October 1st.
My dear countrymen, Kartik Purnima is also a festival of light in this series of festivals of Diwali.
My dear countrymen, I will once again dedicate this Diwali to the soldiers of the country.
My dear countrymen, I salute all of you.
A few days ago, we lost 18 brave sons of our country in a terrorist attack in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay homage to them.
Citizens of Kashmir have started understanding the power of anti-nationalism and as soon as they know the truth, they have separated themselves from such people and left behind the path of peace.
However, Harsh Vardhan, I would also say that there is a lot of value for the anger in the minds of the citizens of the country.
This time, very few people will be aware of the valour of this disabled person in the Parallimpics.
Not only this, I was surprised to note that those among the Divyangjans who were in fourth position and did not receive any medals took less time than those who had won the Gold Medal among the Commonwealth Competitions.
Congratulations to those who have done this work, congratulations to those who have tried to do this.
I appeal to the countrymen that for the honor of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children, we have to free the country from this problem.
Let us move forward with our resolve.

He played an important role in bringing gold medals to India in 1928, in 1932, in the Olympic Games in 1936.
We all know the name of the cricket lover Bradman.
Reading these messages of the people has become a source of inspiration for me.
One Shri Ajit Singh has written in the NarendraodiApp: This time, tell us about their participation in the education and sports of daughters in Mann Ki Baat because they have won medals in Rio Olympics.
Thousands of people have spread this kind of thinking.
It will not be acknowledged that we have displayed our hopes.
In some cases it has happened that our sportspersons did not even reach the same level and got only two medals in the medal list.
However, it is also true that despite not getting the medals, India's sportspersons have performed well for the first time in many sports.
Something like this has been done in the tennis with the link of Saania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna.
Several sportspersons are examples - Aditya Ashoka, Kaziranganal, Atanu Das, whose performance was good.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot.
If we do what we have done, we will have to be resurrected.
I have announced the formation of a committee.
They dedicate their lives to their disciples, to their students.
The contribution of teachers is always felt in our lives.
He always tried to live there as a teacher.
Not only this, he used to always say that the best teacher is the one in which the students are never dead.
You will also have a feeling like me.
Your teachers have shown the world about the good things that have been done in your life. The pride of all teachers will increase.
It is our responsibility to increase the pride of teachers in society.
We all hope that the lives of our country, our society, our families and our individuals should be lost.
We are still living in a free India.
Therefore, in the public Ganesh Festival, "Swaraj Our Rights" should move towards the state with this mantra.
May the State be our priority.
Can we not propagate this message through the massive Ganesh festival
Instead, why shouldn't you use the Ganesh statue built on the soil of the village Pokhari
The idols built in the Plaster of Paris have adverse effects on the environment.
He has expanded many more problems with him.
I also urge all of you that why should we not vibrate our ancient traditions using the idols made of earth
The Lord Ganesh is destroyed.
Therefore, we are persuaded to build Ganesh who will create a dispute.
From the saints, from the saints, from the great men, we always learn something or the other.
I also congratulate the friends of the sky that they have contributed to the foreign policy of the country.
My dear countrymen, you gave me the responsibility of Prime Minister but I am a human like you.
You can imagine that an ordinary teacher, an adult lady who runs a pension money, wants to free the poor mothers from smoke and donate Rs. 50,000 to provide gas connections, this is not a small thing.
50 thousand rupees is not big, it is a mother's feeling. With the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters, trust and energy are being generated for the future of my country.
Those who are trying to create restlessness in Kashmir by stopping these small children, they will have to be responsible for this young child.
My dear countrymen, the country is very big and is full of diversity.
As a citizen, as a society, as a government, it is the responsibility of all of us to strengthen, brighten and brighten the topics that we emphasize on unity, then the country will enhance its future.
I believe in the power of 1. 25 crore Indians.
Thank you very much today.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago we used to think about foolishness but today the rains are also being enjoyed and the news of floods is also coming.

Keep an eye on cleanliness, observe cautiousness and try to be safe, give special attention to the children.
We must understand that the dengue first attacks the prosperous area.
You might have seen a television statement, but sometimes we are aware of it and sometimes we are sufficiently motivated to take steps.

In the Gita, Lord Krishna said, "I am Ashwatha: Sarvathanang", which means Ashwatha among all trees.
I remember that when I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, there was a large number of footpathers in the Ambaji temple in the month of Bhadrava.
Those who know about the land of Rajasthan can understand how big it is.
This year, Gujarat has taken several projects like forests, Ekta forests and martyr forests to plant trees in crores of numbers in the form of forest festival.
I cannot mention all the states but they are commendable.
My dear countrymen, I got the opportunity to visit South Africa in the past.
This was my first visit, there is diplomatic policy in foreign travels, trade is discussed, security is discussed.
However, what I want to say is that this time I got the opportunity to meet such great personalities who have sacrificed their lives for equal opportunities and for equality.
The Indians, however, were ready to sacrifice their lives for those who had gone.
Let us proud of these Indians who have transformed the basic mantra of our lives in South Africa as well.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to the industrialist Burma for giving me a message.

I couldn't do everything myself.
As people have expressed their desire to know about Kedarnath, I am able to experience your efforts to focus on positive things.
The letters and inputs that are available for Mann Ki Baat are completely different from the government work.
People have asked something but I have not seen anything like this for myself in the last five years.
And, you have given me the opportunity to tell me again.
Therefore, the entire country had given a complete election not for its own interests but for the protection of democracy.
Their hard work has resulted in more voting than last time.
You will be surprised to know that the employees of the Election Commission had to travel for two days to reach there.

This centre is at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahole-Spiti region of Himachal Pradesh.

After reading these things, I had a different experience.

From the beginning of this year, he was honored with Padmashree.
He had been running around 300 kilometres daily for 159 days.

Did we not get inspiration to hear about such achievements
The people of Prayagraj are very enthusiastic for Kumbh.
