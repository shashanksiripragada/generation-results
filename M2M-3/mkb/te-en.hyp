The contribution of all yourself is many luxury .
The light in this volume brings happiness, health and prosperity in life, which destroys the opposite and shows good vision.
Festival tourism is a special attraction of the world .
There are immense opportunities for festival festivals in our country.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is important in promoting Festival Tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, we will certainly do something new to this Diwali in Mann Ki Baat for the last time.
On seeing this , innumerable stories of social meditation have been engraved .
This day our brethren are in good profession .

All these Indian goddesses have written a poet in the language of Kannada at that time .
These emotions , those things , Indian laxmis , now the foundation of all that we have said is there .
How important things , how important emotions , how much best thoughts , poets are such in Kannada .
Due to the importance of these archaeologists the future of our society , brightness .
My beloved countrymen , on 12 November 2019 the 550th light festival of Shri Guru Nanak Dev around the world is celebrated .
The effect of Guru Nanak is not only in India , but the whole world .
In many countries of the world our Sikh brothers live in many countries , who are completely unparalleled to the ideal of Guru Nanak Dev .
I can never forget the journey of Vankuver , Tehran Gurudwara .
I would like to tell you how much about Shri Guru Nanak Dev, but he needs many episodes of Mann Ki Baat.
They were standing at the highest place of service .
It is believed that Guru Nanak Dev had done the service done with the emotional emotional emotions .
They were opposite to social ill effects like unconsciousness .
Shri Guru Nanak Dev had discovered his message from far off countries of the world .
One among those who travel more during their time .
We went to many places , wherever they went , they spent all their hearts with their unconsciousness , hearing , simpleness .
Taking Sadbhav , equal messages they went to all the directions of the north eastern direction , at every place people , saints , saints .
It is believed that the famous sage Shankar Dev of Assam also got encouraged with him .
He traveled to the sacred Haridwar .
Guru Bagh is a sacred place of Gurudwara in Kashi .
It is said that Shri Guru Nanak Dev had stayed there .
He also visited religious places like Rajgir, Gaya from Buddhism.
Guru Nanak Dev had traveled to Sri Lanka in the south .
During the journey of Bidar of Karnataka Guru Nanak Dev had discovered the problem of water there .
During a Udasi, Guru Nanak Dev visited the surrounding areas of North Kashmir.
He traveled to Uzbekistan , even where there are priests .
In a Udasi, he also visited Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
They are fat in the minds of lakhs of people . Those people have followed their preachings with complete devotion , today .
In some days Christian approximately 85 countries Raibars had gone to Amritsar from Delhi .
There Amritsar Sir Golden Temple has been visited , Guru Nanak Dev had presented the 550th light of the year .
All these representatives have not only visited Golden Temple , but have got the opportunity to know about Sikh traditions , culture .
The 550th light of Guru Nanak Dev is my desire to give more support to bring their thoughts , ideals in our life .
Then once I am praying to Guru Nanak Devji after bending the head .
It is believed that my beloved brothers and sisters , October 31 you must remember .
If you read about the work style of Sardar Saheb , then it is known how strong their planning is .
Thousands of delegates from all over the country have to come to participate in the Kangras Summit in Ahmedabad in 1921.
All the responsibilities of Samadhishwar were on the Sardar Patel .
He also used to enhance the network of water supply in the city.
Who has been organised without deficiency of water .
Not only this, you will be surprised to know that someone's luggage, shoes and shoes have been organised without stealing.
They contacted the rails , made Khadi bags .
At the same time Khadi Victoria also glittered .
Our country has always been defeated by Sardar Patel for playing a unique role in the Rajya Sabha.
As if there is no opportunity of the diversity formed on the basis of Kullu , tradition they have done the main work of determining the primary hiccups .
We all know that a great Bhagirathi , historical work has been done by merging the institutions of Sardar Valbhai Patel institute of India .
You know that Lakshadweep is a group of some islands .
After the partition of India in 1947 the sight of our neighbouring country is on Lakshadweep .
He also sent a ship with his flag .
Immediately after knowing this news about Sardar Patel, they took a very difficult discussion without making time.
Aartiyar brothers, Arkat Ramaswamy and Arkat Lakshmanaswamy etc. told them that the Travel Corps should be flagged off with the people and flagged off at Lakshadweep first.
Immediately with his country Trivarna Patak had flyed there , all the neighbours of the neighbours who attacked Lakshadweep .
After that they do not want to make all efforts for the development of Lakshadweep .
Today Lakshadweep has played its main role in the progress of India .
This is also an attractive tourist spot .
I believe that you will visit these beautiful islands , sea shores .
My dear countrymen, the Statue of Unity, built in the memory of Sardar Patel on 31st October 2018, has been dedicated to the nation for the world.
This is the highest statue of the world .
This is double higher than the Statue of Liberty of America .
The highest statue of the world is the pride of every Hindustani .
On an average, eight and a half thousand people have shown the glory of the Statue of Unity every day.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has declared their belief , devotion in their mind , but now there are many attractive centres like Cuttas Garden , Batter Fly Garden , Jungle Safari , Children New ealand Park , Ekta Narsari .
People get new opportunity everyday , for the convenience of tourists there many villages are provided the facility of homes in their homes .
We have witnessed how a place grows as a world famous tourist destination in a year.
People come there from the country and abroad .
The government has played its role .
In the midst of this time Magazine has given the status of the St . . of University in 100 major tourist destinations of the world .
I hope that you will go to see the Statue of Unity for some time in your precious time.
Every Hindustani who wants to travel and tourism will be associated with the family of at least 15 tourist destinations in India and I will always hear to stay there for one night.
Friends, you know that every year from 2014, we are celebrating the National Unity Day on 31st October.
Today, we have a message to save the unity and integrity of our country in such circumstances.
As soon as 31 October is organised for Run Fort University .
In the last five years, we have seen that in the hundreds of cities, central territories, capitals, district centres, small territories, small territories and towns of Delhi, in addition to Delhi, a large number of women men, villagers, children, youths, elderly people, Divyangs and all are meeting in large numbers.
Something today we are watching an interest , crafts on Marthan among the people .
Run Fort University is also a special opportunity .
Running mind , brain is beneficial for body .
Therefore, not only the body but also the mind and culture to bring India to new heights for the unity of India.
Therefore you are in the city where you can know about the Run Fort University around you .
I believe that you will definitely participate in the race for your fitness for India on 31 October .
My beloved country , Sardar Patel is sitting in the Ikta Sutra of the country .
The magnificence of Akyata mantra is like our life culture . In every country with diversity like India we should strengthen the magnificence of i . . on every way , on every way , on every way .
My dear countrymen, the unity of the country has always been very enthusiastic and awakening to fulfil the mutual harmony.
If we see around us then many such examples are found , in those examples those people who work continuously to increase mutual harmony .
Any self-confidence has tried to fail those situations in their own way according to their benefit .
How many kinds of things were spoken to increase the temperature in the environment .
In different voices an attempt has been made to increase burning sensation .
Some Nidalas , glorious people do not know what they talk to themselves to be famous .
The responsibility of any responsibility is reminded of us .
But this is happening for five days , seven days , ten days , but on coming to judgment a joyous , surprising change has seen the country .
On one side it has been done to increase the temperature of two weeks , but on coming to Ramjanmabhoomi the government , Rajiki birds , social institutions , civilizations , civilizations , civilizations , civilizations have been published .
Try to reduce stress in the environment .
But I remember those days very well .
The dignity of the place of justice has been pridefully recognised, wherever there is no chance of increasing stress and heat.
These things should always be remembered . They give us strength .
Those days , those moments , teach us .
It is an example of how much energy gives the country .
A big wound of the country is a day .
I also dedicate my tribute to them today .
My dear countrymen, today the story of the house is listening to a far-flung shore, the story of every village, from north to south, from east to west, the story of the original corner of Hindustan is that it is a clean story.
Every person , every family , every village wants to tell his joyous experiences related to cleanliness because the efforts of cleanliness are an hundred and thirty crore Hindustan .
Their fruits are also hundred crores of Hindustan .
There is a pleasant thrilling experience .
Not only to separate the garbage in it , making that arrangement is also very important work .
In it , to remove the climate above 130 tonnes around Glacier , which is the biggest service there .
That is also a rare species of snow leopards living in Ecosystem where there are rare animals like sheep , wheat colored bear .
We all know the roots of clean water of these Siachen rivers , glaciers .
Therefore the work of clean parking here i . . people from here to the lower areas by giving clean water to the lower areas . along with this rivers like Nubra , Shiyok are used .
My beloved countrymen, the festival will be a festival to wake up a new consciousness in all our lives.
Otherwise Deepawali meaning specially buying some new object , there is more decrease in the family of every family .
I said once to try to buy things available locally .
If we find important things in our village then for them we do not have to go to the village .
Once again I convey my best wishes to you on this festival of Deepawali .
And to Deepawali we shall be of various kinds of tombs .
But sometimes it feels salt by carelessness .
My many ruins are ruins .
Blessed is many .
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
There is no Indian who is not proud to see our soldiers , our armies .
Everybody of any caste , any place , any religion , or any language every Indian is always ready to tell our soldiers , all their happiness , Madhuni .
All the 125 crore Indians celebrated the Parakram Parv and recalled the Surgical Streck in 2016.
When there was a war on our country in the territory of the territory , our soldiers were given the form of a surgical strike .
How much capacity is hidden in us , how our soldiers keep cutting their lives and protecting all the country .
Main days like Parakram Parva reminds of traditional traditions like being pride to our soldiers in our country .
These days encourage us to maintain the harmony and ethics of our country.
I also participate in a programme in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of martyrs.
In the two world wars happening in the twentieth century our country soldiers gave clean sacrifices for more than one lakh peace .
With the purpose of paying attention to peace in Shantibat it is a courage done by our country soldiers .
India is also one of the countries sending soldiers in maximum numbers to various kinds of peaceful Bhadrata teams of the ICDS .
Our soldiers were playing role in establishing peace in the world wearing blue helmet in decades .
My beloved countrymen , sky pools are unique .
On the 8th honey of October we celebrate the flight team day .
In 1932 the very small airplanes like six stairs , 19 soldiers etc . increased . It is one of the adventurous , powerful airplanes of our team in twenty century .
In 1965 the enemies of the enemies were also our flight team .
Who knows about the freedom fight of Bangladesh done in 1971 .
In 1999, the Air Force also played a key role in eliminating Kargil from the roots.
On the establishment of enemies in Tiger Hills by bombing them night and night, it was also our air force.
If the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically , then how much thanks to the country .
From storm , air , floods to jungles all the natural beauty of cartilages in the jungle is unique in helping the people of the country .
The Air Force has been an example in ensuring equality of women and men in the country.
Now our Air Force is also giving an alternative to the Permanent Commission for women and I have made this announcement from the Red Fort Platform on August 15.
India can now proudly say that India is equal to the support of women with male power in the armed forces of India.
As a powerful woman has now become a soldier .
My beloved country , some days Christian had fought with death for his life .
How to save him from the country of Javat
You know that Kadabhish Tomi is a very adventurous authority .
Without using any modern technology , only with the help of a small boat he was the first Indian surrounded the world .
To participate in the Golden Globe Race in the southern Hindu ocean, he has been moving ahead with his speed in the sea for the past eighty days but the terrible sea storm has brought him problems.
But this guide of the boating team of India spent several days in the sea .
He is the biggest example of adventure, determination and miracles. After saving him from the sea a few days ago, I spoke to him in the phone.
My beloved Descendants , October the second day of October is so important for our country .
This year October is a speciality of two .
From now on both of us are celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi through many programs worldwide .
Mahatma Gandhi 's thoughts have given the inspiration of the world .
In 1941 Gandhiji started writing some thoughts in the form of a constructive program i . . creative program .
Later on in 1945 when freedom fight was swallowed then he made his thoughts everybody .
To save the rulers of Puja Babu Railways , villages , workers , cleanliness , education have kept their thoughts in front of the people of the country .
It is also called Gandhi Charter .
This is the speciality of his personality .
How important , important necessity of this country has been understood to everyone .
Then thou shalt feel as if thy doubt is being destroyed , thy arrogance is melting .
My beloved countrymen , Gandhiji had said this mantra which is still important .
Today the middle class of the country is increasing , their economy is increasing , shopping power is increasing .
When we went to buy something then remember this mantra once after remembering the worshipped Bapu .
Because of shopping this thing I give benefit to any citizen in the country .
Who has the cost of happiness in the mouth .
I believe that this is his message . poorer than everyone , weaker in the life of a person you can change a great change in the life of a person .
It is said that Gandhiji will get freedom from my favorite country people , cleanliness .
Since he did not know but India came to India .
For example , because of the shopping of Khadi , fishing products many people give help to the workers .
All these Khadi clothes are also so difficult that they are not made , they should use each other .
Looking very unforgettable from outside , from inside the pills like mountains Lal Bahadur Shastri .
The ' Jai Jawan Jai Kisan ' is an exhibition of the great personality of the artistic science .
During his contemporary period , during his contemporary period , his country 's soldiers , rails were given the mantra of victory .
My dear countrymen , it is common to talk about cleanliness while remembering the priests of our priests .
The fifteenth of September started a garden called Swachhta Seva .
Millions of people participated in this park and I also got the opportunity to donate cleanliness with children at Ambedkar School in Delhi.
Baba Saheb Ambedkar himself laid the foundation of that school .
The people of all the classes of the country participate in the labor done on this September fifteenth century .
Come on, let's get a phone call.
Your phone call is telling you special thanks .
Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention (Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention) i. e.
The Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention will be concluded at the beginning of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Bapu on October 2, 2018.
If you want to give freedom , peace , justice to people , then it is specially important .
In the state built by Baba Saheb Ambedkar many places have been done for the first handicrafts of the lice .
Inspired by them, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established on October 12, 1993.
In some days NHRC has been fulfilled .
NHRC has not only saved human rights but has also done this commission to increase our pride.
The Prime Minister of our Majesty, our beloved leader, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has clearly stated that human rights are not privileged to us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal formula of the Vedic period is dedicated to the 'Sarveda Bhawan Sukhi'.
NHRC has provided an expansive opportunity for human rights , with which it has also played an important role in stopping the use of hiccups in it .
In this journey of pancreas NHRC has made all the environment of faith in the people of the country .
It is my belief that this is a great optimistic event for a healthy society, for the best democracy values.
In the national level with the work of human handicrafts in the national level the commission of mankind of twenty six countries has also been established .
This is the basis of the idea of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas' - Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas - Sabka Vikas - Sabka Vikas.
In the month of October , in the month of my beloved country , Jay Prakash Narayan is the birth anniversary of the Jayanti of the Rajmata Vijayraja Scindia Festival starts .
I would like to detail this in the Mann Ki Baat of Mann Ki Baat. In the last few years, Sardar Saheb Jayanti is being organised in every small towns and villages in India on 31st October.
This time also we will make this ' Run Fort University ' in every small and big cities , areas , villages .
Run for Unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb.
On October 31, we will strengthen all our efforts to confront all the sections of the society and all the regions of the country with equality through the Run For Unity.
This is the same place that we give him .

My dear countrymen, this rainy season brings many hopes to our farmers working hard.
The dry trees , plants , dry rivers , dry rivers .
But sometimes this rainy season also brings the floods to give destruction .
At some places less rains , at some places more rains are falling naturally .
The destruction of leaving the danger behind them is unfortunate .
But on the occurrence of dangers humanity meaning what we understand .
The conservation program happening in Kerala is known to all the soldiers of the soldiers of the soldiers .
They did not leave any opportunity to save those stuck in the floods .
Air Force, not forecast, not forecast, but forecast, but forecast, BSF, CISF, RAF, everybody has played a big role in helping and protecting efforts.
I would like to specifically tell you about the hard work done by the NDRF and how excellent they have helped in such a situation.
The efforts made by the NDRF to keep their ability, their committee, active decisions and to keep the situation in mind every Indian has to be taken care of.
Ninnaum festival .
In order to come out of this danger very quickly, we pray to the nation, especially the state of Kerala, to give the power of this Omam festival, to the state of Kerala, to the resurgence of the state of Kerala.
The people of Kerala , the people of the country , the other places of the country , the whole country are with them once again I believe that all the countrymen are with them .
My dear countrymen , this time I see the information coming for Manki Baat that I have come more about one thing .
They are about Shri Atal Bihari Wajpai .
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swativats from Sonipat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banerjee from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar, etc.
The archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically drowned in the country .
He is a great country which left the prime minister of the fourteen years old .
If you want to say one way then the last teeth went away from the royal palaces .
People asked him the best parlor , delicate architect , great architect , beloved .
Due to the reason of bringing the supplication in the life of the life of the life of the supplication the country of Alzheimer 's country is sufficient .
Our gratitude to Atal ji is always due to the 91st Constitution Amendment Act, 2003.
This survey has brought two major changes in the royal palaces of India .
First change is that the number of mantras in the states is fifteen percent in the number of Vidhyasbha seats .
It has been changed to Atal .
That is why money was played .
Due to this the capacity of the work has increased .
Due to the point of view of far-flung people like Atal , these conditions have started increasing healthy traditions in our royal culture .
Atalpur is a true patriot .
Change has been changed during entering the budget in their administration .
Initially according to the tradition of the British , the time of parliament was held in London , therefore in the evening the budget was entered .
In 2001 Atal ji changed the time of five in the evening , for eleven in the morning .
In the same way you are seeing the churches of the states , central centres once in the country .
This is a good result of democracy .
Healthy democracy , best democracy , good traditions , consistent labor to strengthen democracy , unsuccessful churches , etc. all of us are also the best tribute to Atalji .
The functioning of the work in the Lok Sabha is nineteen percent , the functioning of the state is seventy four percent .
The rainy season sessions of the Parliament are always reminded of social justice and development of the youth.
In these conferences many important children used for youth , backward classes have been adopted .
For decades there is a desire to choose the commission of Organisation like SCST commission .
To ensure the rights of the backward classes, the country has fulfilled the resolve to set up an ODC this time.
It has also given the authority of a state . social judgment which takes forward .
Therefore parlor has entered the hard training by filling the parlor of parlor .
According to this not only less than teeth of the iniquities of the iniquities of the iniquities , education of the girls in twelve years is done .
A few days ago, you must have been studying in the books and a court in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, after just two months of inquiries, a girl has been accused of two offenders in the case of rape.
Earlier in Madhya Pradesh, in a court in Kathani, only five days after inquiries, the infidels were executed.
Even in Rajasthan, the judges have taken some such rapid decisions.
This chatti plays an important role in stopping the unrighteousness occurring on women , girls .
When we move forward for the country, we can bring changes in the lives of the poor, the backward, the oppressed and the oppressed.
This time in the occasion of rainy season everybody stands an ideal .
All the parlors of the country are telling thanks to the heart of Bahraang .
My dear countrymen, the eyes of crores of people are on the Asian crowns being held in Jakarta.
Asia crickets are happening even more .
I am telling all the sports done for the country .
India will build a bright future only if India is fit.
I want to see the best exhibition of the victory over Asia , along with this other sports also want to see the best exhibition .
Everybody 's national sports day is a contemporary sports .
Besides this the whole country also remembers him with great pride , spirituality .
In their memory September is celebrated as the fifteenth day of engineers .
The engineers of our country walking in their footsteps have discovered their existence in the world .
In Kutch it is called 'Bhunga'.
These houses were seen three earthquakes .
But you will see any harm at some places .
Our ancestors have made this house according to the environment here , according to nature .
It is said that it was pride that I heard that before the centuries the engineers of that time according to the local situations , ordinary people were such constructions like living safely .
Now when we are celebrating engineers then we should also think about our future .
Keep work shops at every place .
During changing time we want to learn some new things .
What should be taught to students .
Then mix .
In the middle of this many places rains are coming properly .
At some places more rains are also coming to the architects .
In some places people are waiting for rains because of no rains .
The opposite to nature has been brought to man .
That is why sometimes nature feels fatigue on us .
Therefore we have the responsibility of protecting nature , nature .
The hair of twelve Junior football players in Thailand went to a cave for their coach tour .
Normally it takes some hours to go inside that cave , to come out .
But the decision of that day is another way .
For coming out no way they had stayed near a small ditch situated inside the cave .
Not only in one , two days , but in the same way for eighteen days .
On the one hand, if they fight with danger, on the other hand, the entire humanity of the world has displayed the values of the humanity of God.
Throughout the world these children have prayed to come out safely .
Those children who were stuck , in which condition they tried to know all possible .
If you do not want to take the water out then it is impossible to bring them out during the rainy season .
Unfortunately they were safe and enjoyed everybody in the world as soon as they came safe .
But how did this conservation program take place with another point of view .
The responsibility of the fulfilment found in every level has been marvellous .
Government , parents of children , their family members , media , people of the country , all have also been seen marvellously , courageously .
In this whole behavior a Jawan of Dhayland boat had also lost his life .
It is enough to work on our goal by keeping our mind on our goal with cosmetic , stable mind .
The favorite poet of our country Niraj had left us for a few days .
Our Indians can also give strength to the Indians , how much strength can be given , inspiration .
This is the time of the beginning of the art gallery .
On coming to July the youth is stepped in the most important part of their life , where their eyes turn towards Kat-off from the questions .
The meditation of students changes from home to hospital .
Students come in the shadow of professors from the shadow of their parents .
I believe that my young friends keep keeping their college life very happy , enthusiasm .
This is the time when you have to be able to get out of the house for the first time, get out of the village and get out of a frequent atmosphere.
How many youths leave their houses for the first time , come out to give a new direction to their life .
I tell you all that stay calm , enjoy life , enjoy your mind completely in life .
Small friends are priceless .
But to choose new friends , to mix friends , to keep those friends standing very well .
Learn new experts , new languages .
The student of Ashram Chaudari of a poor family of Madhya Pradesh had achieved victory over all the difficult competitions in his life.
Jodhpur was successful in the first attempt of AIMS Taluku MBS test .
And his father did the work of gathering unto his father , and nurtured his family .
My beloved countrymen , a few days Christian attracted a archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically associated with my sight .
It has been told that if we read inside then how our youth technology is trying to bring changes in the life of normal person .
Once in Sanjoj city called technology hub in America I am celebrating with Indian youths .
I want them to do something for the country by thinking about how they can use their everybody for India.
Using their professional expertise both of them together have made a smart village yp .
Apart from contacting the people of this village with the world they have to take any advice on any other hand , information , if they have to get it available in their own mobile .
In a way an attempt to bring digital revolution in this Yap village is made easy to record the development works done in the village by this Yap , tracking , monitoring .
The app consists of Phone Directory, Department of News, Jabita, Health Centres and Information Centres in the village.
In order to know the FACT rate between the villagers of the App, the marketplace is used for their production.
This thing will be understood by you people in America that the youngsters are living in the middle of their lifestyle and thoughts, even after leaving India for many years, even after remembering the smaller things of their village and understanding the challenges of their villages.
That is why they can do anything properly in the village .
This relationship with their villages, their roots is natural for every Indian to do something for the country.
But sometimes because of the time , due to the situation , because of the situation , a thin dust gets named on it , but if someone is touched with a small salt then all things come up again .

Tirthankaras or Vithoba or Pandurang reach there for the visit of Vithal Bhagwan .
Vithal Bhagwan protects the lice , bending , paintings .
Maharashtra , Karnataka , Goa , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana people have unparalleled faith , devotion .
To go to Vithoba temple in Pandarpur , the glory , beauty and spiritual joy there is a special experience .
If possible then I want to feel the experience of Pandarpur once .
Innumerable saints like Gyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas and Tukaram are still punishing the common people in Maharashtra.
We get the message of harmony , love , brotherhood by their main folk songs , Bharud or Abhang by them .
Due to this the society of the society is available to fight against the foolish beliefs .
The power of the British rulers to see their wrongs , Chaturya is in him .
The English i . . Tilak i . . in twenty years he tried to stop Rajdroha thrice .
This is not a small thing .
I share an interesting event with the people of the country about a Tilak statue located in Lokmanya Tilak, Ahmedabad.
He said that when Lokmanya Tilak died on August 1920, he would recognise his memorial statue in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was selected as the Mary of Ahmedabad city . Venkatetoria Garden for the memorial of Lokmanya Tilk . This garden is named Britain ueen .
Finally the idol was built . Sardar Portuguese besides anyone , 1929 February 28 Mahatma Gandhi had been done with Gandhiji .
The most important thing is that after coming to Sardar Patel in his address in that garden council the idol of Tilakka was also possible because of his devotion.
Due to the efforts of Lokmanya Tilaks the tradition of social Ganesh Festival started .
These collective Ganesh Festivals along with traditional faith , festival , social awakening , social awakening , community , equality among the people have become an effective medium .
Our ancient heritage , history standing in history this is also known as how much interesting in our youth .
Today in many cities approximately in every street we see the idols of Ganesha keeping the idols of Ganesh .
Pujas are organised in that street mixed with a hair .
It is a very important opportunity for our youth where it is possible to learn the qualities of leadership , behavior etc .
Good rule , development fruits give every Indian .

It is true that I am coming to Maghar on 28th honey .
When I worked at Kabirwood in Gujarat, I had organized a national conference with some people who followed the Kabir tradition.
Why do you go to the cost of Kabir Dass Maghar
There was a belief that on death in Maghar he would not reach heaven .
It is believed that on doing body sacrifice in Kashi heaven goes to heaven .
If we see the magnificence of the magnificence then the Satpurus Kabir Das does not believe it .
He tried to destroy the foolish beliefs , ill effects situated in his lifetime .
Therefore he went to Maghar and was the sepulchre there .
Kabi Das has dedicated social equality , peace , brotherhood by his creation , jewellery .
These are his ideals .
This is the ideal of his creation .
In this time also they are inspired by us .
One of his writings is Kabir Soi Peer Hai , Jo John Peer John Peer Peer Na Janahi , So Ka Peer Meer Peer , that is , the true saint who understands the pain of the satisfaction is the best .
Special attention has been shown to the social opinions of Kabir Dass .
He used to think more about the future time than his time .

Due to the reason of the hilly area these fruits are not available properly .
The rails of Kapkot area have discovered the way to increase the price of selling these fruits directly in the market .
Because of excessive iron minerals in all these fruits these iron elements are very beneficial for pregnant women .
In Munnar village all these rails have organised a government institution , where these biscuits have been opened .
On seeing the courage of the farmers, the government has also conveyed the institution to the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM).
Now apart from approximately fifty anganwadi centres of Bageshwar district Almora , Kausani are being provided .

The whole world is watching India as a center of development , Navaku , development centres .
With the thought of industrial development in cities, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar believed in urban development and urbanization in India.
Not only this , if something is divided to the poor then their lice goes away . He is not confessed .
Today, the beginnings of Mudra Yojana, Startup India and Standup India are born to our young innovators and young businessmen.
Dr. Baba Saheb has also been suggested to increase the water consumption for the development of the country. Various river volley authorities related to water and water related commissions have also been dreamed of Dr. Baba Saheb .

Manki Baat February 2018 .
This question has given us an important scientist to modern India .
Before talking about science we are talking about science .
His research was famous by the name of Raman effect .
On one side the famous Ganesha scientist Bodhya , Bhaskar , Brahma Gupta , Aryabhat etc . are traditional .
On the other hand in the treatment of treatment Sushrut , Charak is our pride .
Scientists like Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose, Har Govind Khurana to Satyendranath Bose are the pride of India.
The name of Satyendranath Bose has also been named as the main particle BOSON.
In the meanwhile, I got the opportunity to participate in a programme in Mumbai. It is a grand invitation to the starting year of the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It is very interesting to know about the miracles happening in science .
Through Artificial Intelligence, it will help create robots, boats and other special work instruments.
In the middle of this machines also themselves increase their intelligence even more .
This technology is beneficial for enhancing the lives of some poor , badhis , needy people .
Is it possible to get any help from Artificial Intelligence to transform the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters in that program
For a few days, with the Prime Minister of Israel, I got the opportunity to visit Patna in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.
There I saw a digital form made of a young man .
I would like to use artificial intelligence in such a way.
The price of science and technology is stable .
They do not have any price .
Every instrument works only as we want .
But what kind of work we do by the instrument depends on us .
Here the goal of human goal is main .
The science should not only be used for human welfare but also for climbing the best peaks of human life .
Thomas Alva Adison, who met the Light Bulb, was successful in his research many times .
It is fortunate that I am in Auroville, the Karmabhoomi of Maharshi Auroville.
Similarly in the form of a Maharshi every question of life has been questioned .
They also saw the way to humanity .
To know the truth it is very important to keep questioning every time .
In the contribution of National Science I am telling all the people associated with our scientists , science .
Friends , at the time of danger many times I keep coming to the subjects of security , disorder etc . people keep coming to me .
In a message sent by Ravindra Singh from Pune to the Narendra Modi Yap, he proposed a competitive safety.
Safety standards are not very important in our country where factory and construction works are being done.
He said that the fourth Teeti National Safety Day of March, therefore, the Prime Minister wanted to give some precautions about Bhadrata in his Mann Ki Baat program, and to increase the opportunity of Bhadrata in the people.
In daily life we do not take precautions about Bhadrata , not taking precautions , it becomes difficult to get Bhadrata during dangers .
If concentration is decreasing then there is a danger, one mistake is damaged, pleasure and laughter is curtailed. Do not take so quick bonds - do not enhance relations with security - do not play with security - do not lose life.
By crossing that path all the time in our life can not be used .
But if we leave the natural beauty then most of the dangers happen due to our layers .
If we remain very best, if we take necessary precautions, not only save our lives, but also save our society from big dangers.
There are many information about Bhadrata at the place of working once but nobody can participate them properly .
I wish that the archaeological incidents situated in Mahanagars , cities have to make mak drill in front of the children of various schools once in a week with fire memorials .
This country has faced many natural , man-made dangers of many chemical , industrial accidents .
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is conducting major seeds in the country.
On occurrence of various types of dangers like earthquakes, floods, storms etc. , when there is rescue operation, NDMA reaches there only .
Besides this they also keep training programs for capacity building .
In the districts coming to floods , temporary districts a program has been done by the name of Apada Mitra for training .
Training , best role is very important role .
Two-three-three Christians were killed every year due to hot bullocks.
In 2017 the number of deaths occurring due to hot bullocks in 2017 decreased to 220 .
Therefore, it is known that if we give importance to Bhadrata, we can be safe.
If there is such a danger in the society then innumerable people , social incidents , social incidents , immense citizens coming there .
Under the leadership of India, all countries including BIMSTEC, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal etc. have done a Joint Disaster Management Exercise.
This is the first , great human use .
They should participate in our life .
Normally we keep traveling in the airways many times . airways keep giving information about air host Bhadrata in the beginning .
All these information also listen to us many times .
But if someone takes us in the airways standing , where is the life jacket , asks how to use it , then I can definitely say that nobody in us is able to say proper peace .
There is a chance of seeing them clearly .
That is .
But we don't pay attention.
Therefore, no one of us thinks that we are sitting in the air and listening to the precautions of our ears but they are saying our anger.
We feel like every kind of life .
We do not consider this Bhadrata for us .
If we all are very best for our Bhadrata then the society is also international in it .
My dear countrymen, this time in the budget, we have started a programme keeping in mind the issue of waste to wealth, waste to energy, wealth from waste to wealth, energy from waste to waste.
GOBAR-Dhan means Galvaniing Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of this Gobar-Dhan is not only to convert villages into cleaning, animal liquidity and central liquidity COMPOST, BIO-GAS but also to produce funds and energy through them.
The number of animals in India is approximately 30 crores of their name is 30 lakh tonnes .
Some European countries , Chinese cattle are produced to produce the energy of animals , remaining centres .
But in India they are not useful in the whole condition .
The part of Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen is now moving in this direction.
The objective is to generate bio-gas based energy from the vains available from animal liquidity, concentration, etc.
Under the Gobar Dhan Yojana, the farmers in rural India are encouraged not only to look at the poor and vain of their brothers and sisters but also to see them as a medium of earning money.
The health of animals shining , their production increases .
Due to bio gas the capacity of cooking , lining cosmetics increases in the matter of energy .
This technique is helpful in increasing the arrival of rails , animals .
New jobs increase for vegetation , transport , girls , etc .
A online trekking platform is also prepared for the sanctuary of Gobar Dhan , which contributes with rails , shopping .
I would like to extend this opportunity to the businessmen, especially the sisters living in rural areas to come forward and make their own help groups and collaborative committees.
I would like to invite you to participate in the Clean Energy and Green Jobs and ask you to make vain in the villages in the direction of making Gobar-Dhan.
My dear countrymen, till now we have heard about various kinds of festivals like Music Festival, Food Festival, Film Festival etc.
However, the first waste festival was organised by a special effort in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
The objective behind this festival started by the Raipur city administration is to provide awareness about the various methods of not using the hygiene of the city and not using the hygiene of the city again.
All the students and elders participated in various programmes organized during the festival.
Inspired by inspiration from Raipur in some other districts also vain festivals have been held in different ways .
International women festival is held every year on the eightth day of March .
Many programs take place in our country , worldwide .
That is, we are talking about the development of women and motherhood by moving ahead from the growth of women.
In this context, I remind of Swami Vivekananda's words: He is the idea of perfect womanhood is perfect independence - the idea of Swami Vivekananda, a hundred and fifty years ago, expresses Nari Shakti in Indian culture.
In the tradition of men recognized women we were participating in the tradition of women . Yashodan , Kausalya , the sons of Gandhari , this was the identity of every son .
Now I got some information from Jharkhand .
Under the Swachhta campaign, about 15 lakh women in Jharkhand - not only this small number - 15 lakh women were involved in Swachhta campaign for a month.

How big accident it can you imagine .
In ordinary life the women of Jharkhand have proved that in order to convert the cleanliness culture , clean culture into a natural way of common people women can try to be effective .
I saw in the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically after the independence of three villages of Elephanta Island .
You all know very well , Elephanta Island is located at a distance of ten kilometres from the sea from Mumbai .

The festival of Holi coming this month is also very favorite for all of us in this month .
On the second day of March the Holi festival of the country is celebrated with enthusiasm .
The importance of colors in Holi festival is as much as Holika is burning . It is the day of destruction by burning evil in the fire .
Forgetting all the different opinions of the mind , sitting together , each other 's joy , the joy of each other i . . this festival gives the message of love , opinion , brothers , brothers .

Since ancient times the pride of women in our country , their place found in the society , their support is surprising the whole world .
There is a tradition of many scholars in India .
There is a couple of Indian scholars in Vedasar Museum .

A few days Christian President President started a new work .
A book has also been made on these women achievers and First Mediadies to know about the power of this woman in the country, to inspire her from her life and her work.

Sweets are changing .
Such a thing came to me . Our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have seen a great example .
The matter of tribal women i . . a definite picture is seen in everyone 's mind . in which the picture of women walking on the heads of the head is seen .
But our tribal women of Chhattisgarh have shown a new picture to the country .
In the Dantewada area of Chhattisgarh, the Maoists have created a terrible environment with violence, hypocrisy, bombs, temporaries and maoists.
In such a dangerous place tribal women were standing on their feet by walking this rickshaw .
At some time some women met in it .
Therefore three benefits are being done . on one side itself has made them capable .
Leave it in our hands , adopt changes at necessary places .
It is speciality of our society to correct itself .
Such Indian tradition , such culture has been found in our heritage .

He was a topper in the Kashmir Administrative Services Test.
In 1990 the acute people burnt their ancestors ' house .

On all the four sides such a violent environment is enough to fill dark , cruel thoughts in the mind of a small child but Anjum does not let it happen .
He never left hope .
He chose a new way for himself . The way to serve people .
He came out of the opposite environment and came to his victory story .

My beloved countrymen, not only in our country but also in the famous religious regions of the world, it is natural to propose about the hut of Shabrimala in Kerala.
For the blessings of Appa Swami in this world famous temple every year many devotees come here in numbers of crores .
How important is the place coming to such a devotee , cleanliness , how much is it possible to participate .
Specially because of being a place situated in the middle of hilly area , forests it is more difficult to fulfil cleanliness .
But to solve this problem, to change the problem as a culture, to explain the way out of the problem and to find out how much the support of the people is, the temple of Shabrimala is an important example.
Shri P.

In rural areas , urban areas changes occurring with expansive participation are seen .
The Clean Survey 2018 is being conducted from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to assess the level of sanitation in urban areas.
These surveys take place in approximately 40 crores of population in four thousand cities .
The Survey also envisages ensuring that cities are free of defecation, collection of toilets, transportation arrangements, scientific cleaning of toilets, efforts for changes in habits, new efforts for capacity building and cleanliness, participation of people for this work etc.
This survey , various waters go and make the cities their own .
Talking to the citizens and taking their opinions .
The Cleanlin Organisation App is estimated to be used and changes in various types of services.
Through this survey the cleanliness system organised in cities is estimated to be part of the cleanliness of the city or part of the life style of people .
Cleanliness is not only the government .
This is also the biggest responsibility of every citizen , every proposal .
In the days of coming everybody participates with enthusiasm in this survey .
In this survey, you should try hard without your city, your place, your streets behind.
It is my belief that using blue color , green colored blue color , leafy blue color to keep away from the wet , dry dirt of your house is still a habit of all of you .
It is very beneficial to reduce , use again , use of rehabilitation .

Our city - our efforts, our development - the path of progress for the country should be made by all of you.

Loving my country residents , some things are very small to see but socially affects our identity .
I would like to share one such thing with you through Mansulo Vadak.
Who has made such a rule .
Wherefore is the necessity .
It is said that when I went deep in this matter then independence came to independence and came to the forty years then we understood that we were observed .
For decades Muslim women have become unconscious but no churches have happened .
There is no rule in many Mohammad countries .
But Muslim women in India do not have this authority.
Our government has made me very happy to pay attention to this thing .
Normally Haj travellers are given permission by latri method but my opinion is to keep women alone away from this latri method .
Our women also get authority as compared to men . In the progressive way they also have to make them equal opportunity to walk with men .

In the expansive expansion of the Chola empire , in the contemporary states of contemporary states Kella has played a big role in standing economic power .
The examples of the adventurous journeys of the navels of Chola are available in Sangam literature .
Many people know that many people of the world have given permission to women on the boats after many years .
But in the navel team eight , nine hundred years creatively women played the main role of women in large numbers .
Women also participate in war .
The scientific science related to boating was rich .

Several forts like Sindhu Durg , Murud Janjira , Golden Fort etc . were surrounded by sea shores or sea shores .
The responsibility of all these forts was done by the boating team of Marathas .

My dear countrymen, December 5th, World Soil Day.
On this occasion I want to tell some things with my brother , brothers .
The most important part of the earth is soil .
The symbol of eating us is covered with this soil .
One way the whole food chain is covered with soil .
There is no soil , trees do not increase .
Where is the cost of human life
How is the cost of living animals
This thing has been discussed in our culture a long time ago . This is the reason why we have been the best since the ancient times of the ancient times of soil .
On the one hand in our culture natural efforts have also been made to be the feeling of devotion in the people of soil , soil , on the other hand some scientific methods have become part of our life .
Both devotion to our soil , scientific soil conservation and conservation are also important in the lives of the farmers of this country.
It is a matter of pride to show zeal to modern sciences , to make efforts , to make efforts , to make all of us pride .
I have heard about the farmers of Bhoraj Block in Tohu village of Hamirpur district of Himachal Pradesh.
It is said that some rails of the village were able to test their soil during the time , some kind of red nutritious substances , central red nutritious red .
After that you will be surprised to hear the results .
Along with this the soil has also been shining in the clay .
If you want to think about the fruit then precaution of the earth beforehand . If we do not preserve the earth then the mother of the earth saves us all .
All our brothers of the country understood their soil more well , according to that they have taken soil health cards above ten crore .
We worship the mother of the earth but how much the health of the earth gets spoiled with the red .
It has been proved by all kinds of scientific tests that due to the reason of excessive loss of landslides more than necessary .
Global warming , changes in the environment , we feel all .
Sometimes the winters came in front of Deepavali . Now December is coming slowly steps .
But in the beginning of winters we do not want to come out of all the chariots . It is an experience for all of us .
Due to this child who went to 30,40 houses everyday, he got rid of the urination of Bahraang village because of this child who had spoken about cleanliness.
In the direction of increasing cleanliness the little child has done how inspiring work .
There is no need to sing cleanliness with age , there is no limit .
Children , elders , women , men are important for everyone .
It is necessary to do something for cleanliness .
Our brother , brothers , sisters are strong .
The capable , adventurous . can make any contribution .
They can learn something or the other every moment.
These are coming in every hole .
In some social problems , in some social problems our brothers do not take anyone .
You must remember that in Rio Olympics, our Divyang sportspersons have won four medals by exhibiting a well-known game.

On the second time there is a chance of telling a lot of pockets .
Manki Bath : Talk in mind .
Special festival this Chhat Puja is completely celebrated with nature , nature worshipped this festival .
During this worship of sunrise , water is worshipped . utensils , soil utensils , bamboo etc . different items covered with these worshipping methods .
In this festival filled with faith the message of worshipping sunrise , sunset is filled with a special culture .
If the world is worshipped then it is necessary to worship those who know that worship in this Chat Puja is also worshipped .
In our life this festival is also said to be so much important in our life .
In front of this festival people also clean the shores of Patu , river , ponds , ponds , worshipping rivers with great enthusiasm .
It is natural to consider everybody proud of this great tradition of India .
But when I look at the impact of words in mind among the people, I believe that the words in mind with the people of the country have become a 100 strong bond.
Take the example of Khadi , fields .
During Gandhi Jayanti the consequences of eating Khadi , fields have been done that you will also be happy .
On the fifteenth of October i. e.
Khadi , fish , two girls are such a big height that you also have a joyous thing .
During Deepavali about 680 percent old age was registered in the girls of Khadi Gift Coopen .
In the entire girls of Khadi , handicrafts also this year approximately ninety percent old age has been registered .
In this meditation youth , elders , children , age groups , women , all adults also like Khadi , dogs .
That is why I can imagine how much benefit to families , families , many poor families .
I have said Khadi for fashion. Now, Khadi for fashion, Khadi for fashion, all the places for fashion have been transformed for Khadi.
Besides bringing changes in the lives of poor workers, both the Khadi and the taxpayers are changing into the powerful means of bringing them up with power.
How to provide our household sweets to the Bhadrata groups in the Nredra Modi Yap in Tejas Gaikwad.
It is said that during the festival we also remember our soldiers .
I also felt that the sweets of our house were given to the Bhadrata teams .
On the other hand we got the opportunity to celebrate Diwali festival with our Veer Bhadrata teams in the borders .

In the borders of the country how hard , poisonous and other conditions they meet our Bhadrata teams keep protecting the country , that conservation , dedication , dedication , dedication , dedication , dedication of all the people of the country .
On getting the opportunity we should know the experience of our soldiers , when we get the opportunity , then listen to their pride stories .
It is said that not only the soldiers of our Bhadrata team but also the main role of establishing peace all over the world has been done in us .
In the United Nations Peacekeeper United States, peace observers are changing India's name all over the world.
On October 24, a few days Christian day was celebrated throughout the world i . . Ikrajya Samiti Day .
The attempts to establish peace in the world , their successful role everybody remembers .

With this belief, India is playing an active participant in various important efforts of the first India Ikrajya Samiti .
You will be aware that the proposal of the Indian Convention, the proposal of the UNCC Charter, both of them will start with the terms of 'We the People'.
The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights is an example of this.
It feels very small changes but a strong thought is seen in it .
India has played the most important role in peacekeeping activities of the United Nations under Umbrella.
India has always been playing a vital role in the UKSCs Taluku Peacekeeping Mission.

The Bhadrata teams of India have not only saved the people there in many countries but have spent many hearts by making friendly operations there.
Indian women have played an important role in the establishment of peace programs .
After that all the rest of the countries also started sending their women police units .
You will be proud to hear that India's role is not only contributing to the peacekeepers of about eighty five countries.
Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha walked through this land our peacekeepers gave the message of peace and harmony to the world .
Peace conservation works are not so easy .
The soldiers of our Bhadrata have to work in dangerous areas as well .
Different kinds of humans have to stay between humans .
Different situations , various kinds of traditions have to be recognized .
They have to forget themselves according to the local needs of those places , situations .

Your movement is right . This is why the diseases occurring in old age have come at the end of life - which are now seen in children as well .

Such diseases were rare in youth .
But this has changed our lifestyle .
Such diseases are known by the name of life style .
Change in our food habits , there is no adequate physical labor in life , people are the main causes of such diseases in the age of pinnacle .
It is necessary to pay attention to this matter of society , family .

Small tasks have to be done regularly in the right way , changing their habits , changing them naturally .

Do the habit of roaming down on the stairs without using lift .
After dinner try to walk everybody , children in the family .
It is easy because someone can learn easily because yoga can be done somewhere .

In this program running for two hundred days people have run a clean program without stopping , not tired , standing in a hair .
Regularly two hundred days .
Before the program , after that they sent me photographs .
This Bhagirathi attempt done for cleanliness is a marvellous example of beauty , community , everlasting example .
Forts are symbols of our heritage .
The responsibility of keeping historical buildings safe , clean is all the people of the country .
I convey my best wishes to all the people of Chandrapur, the Ecological Protection Organization.

My dear countrymen , after two days we are celebrating the Jayanti of Sardar Vallabhai Patel on 31 October .
We all know that modern Akhand is the foundation of India .
How much can we learn from the extraordinary journey of the great child of India
On 31 October 31 AD Indira Gandhi left this proposal .
And he said unto him , He is true in making the thought .
The cracks standing on one side of India have been displayed by Sardar Vallabhai Patel .
Crores of Indians have decided to bring India under one nation, one state.
Their decision has given them the power to face all the obstacles .
Where there is need of entertainment worked with entertainment .
Where it is necessary to use force there it is possible .
They decided a goal that they went ahead with complete artificial artificial artificially .
This program of uniting the country can be done every week .
Everybody has imagined the country like that of equality .
I wish their words to be inspirational to all of us - we should not stop the distinction between the tribes.
This story of Sardar is also an inspiration , related to our dream of New India .
For this reason their Jayanti is celebrated on the occasion of the country .
Their support is unparalleled in giving the form of an unparalleled form of the country .
My dear countrymen , with a new determination after Deepawali Shelves , with a new determination , you will start your daily life again .
All the people of my generation want to wish all their dreams , luxury .
Through the sky you have spent three times while talking to everyone in your mind .
The word in the mind of these is 36th .
I have never said these things in my mind .
In this mind the words of the people of the country are the words which I have sent to me from all the corners of the country .
In these many people give me inspiration .
Many people are like bringing changes in the government .
Some persons have to pay attention to the problems of camel , some social problems .
Once in a month, I am taking your time for half an hour but people keep on talking for ' Mansu in Mansu' for thirty days in a month.
Therefore the journey of this three - three hearts is the journey of all the people of the country , feelings , feelings .
In such a short time I am telling thanks to all the people of the country to give me the opportunity to understand the common feelings of India .
Now three-three years have been completed therefore social scientists , university , researchers , media specialists definitely consult it .
But such opposite churches are very useful in the future , how much useful in the mind , a new enthusiasm , new enthusiasm .
After that many social institutions of the country , many social institutions , many youths have come to me .
How many people think that they were able to use food at one place left in Kanchenjun , how many people were enjoyed in my sight , how much enjoyed .
Once again, I had seen a surprising photograph of Selfie with Dorter in Haryana and told everyone in my heart about it.
In view of this, not only in one India, but also in the world, there has been a big movement called 'Selfie with Dotter'.
This is not only a matter of social meditation .
This is the incident of producing new self confidence , new pride in every girl .
Everybody felt to take self with their daughters .
Every girl has some importance in itself , it has been believed that it has its importance .
A few days ago I am sitting in the Government of India in their tourism department .
I said that the people traveling there should send photographs to Incredible India wherever they go.
Then lakhs of pictures coming from different parts of India , in one way the work of tourism in the form of tourism has been very big .
I am experienced by words in mind as much as a small incident can be lifted up .
As soon as the thought was fulfilled three times many incidents in my mind walked .
The country is always before walking in the right direction .
Every citizen of the country wants to do something for the progress of the country , for the benefit of the society , for the progress of the country .
It has been learned, heard and learned from the people of the country as part of my three-three Mansu Ki Baat.
This is the biggest power of any country , the biggest power of any country .
I bow down to all the people of the country with heart .
Once I talked about Khadi in mind . Khadi is not a cloth , one thought .
Discounts are given in Khadi girls about two October .
I want to increase this Khadi propaganda in such a way , I want to increase again .
Increasing interest in Khadi, among those who work in Khadi sector and those who are associated with Khadi in the Government of India have also increased enthusiasm to think in a new corner.
How to bring new technologies, how to enhance productivity, how to bring the handicrafts working with solar energy, how to revive the ancient traditions that have been closed from 20-20, 25-25, 30-30 years.
Many people were produced .
Resume of the Khadi and Rural Industries Training Centre closed in Pumpore, Kashmir and Kashmir has a lot of work to provide this sector.
Nowadays in the beginning of the training center the new generations will be helpful in making new things in the construction of new generations , in the middle of this big corporate institutions have been very happy to choose expensive things to give Diwali .
People also started choose Khadi things while giving each other .
Some things naturally go ahead in the experience of all of us .
People of my favorite country , in the mind of Christian month we decided to celebrate the cleanliness festival throughout the country fifteen days before Gandhi Jayanti .
Our honourable President Germany started this program .
Children - elders , men , women , cities , villages , everybody has been participated in the proposal of these .
It is said that I can conduct with Sankalp , how we are moving ahead in the way we are watching the eyes .
Everybody accepts this procedure , supporting it , supporting it .
Therefore I am telling thanks to the presidents of the conservation .
Along with them every class of the country is also considered to be its own work . Everybody was celebrated with this proposal .
In the sports, they, students, schools, art galleries, universities, rails, coolies, officers, police, children, jawans, everybody joined it.
If these places are dirty then people do not see food then this pressure is also seen in those who work there .
It is very good that in the four days of the publicity of Swachhta Seva, more than 50 lakh people and more than forty thousand people participated in this programme.
Some results are definitely working continuously with the goal of showing results .
On the other hand, we also looked at the new thing that while doing a bedroom programme, on the other hand bed should be cautious.
If you want to change cleanliness in a natural way , then the park of Bhavogadh is also necessary .
This time many competitions have been done by clean service .
More than two and a half thousand children participate in the competition of this clean milk .
Thousands of children have made pictures .
With their own imagination pictures have been pictured about cleanliness .
When the word came to the forefront then I forgot the media to tell them blessedness .
We are seeing how much the Electronic Media, Print Media and the country are serving in the Swachhta Seva Garden.
In the meanwhile somebody told me about the youth of Billa Dar of Srinagar .
You will be happy to know that this Bill Dar has been appointed as its Brand Ambassador for the Portuguese Corps of Srinagar. Brand Ambassador i. e.
Not only .
Bill Dar had paid attention to the cleanliness of his twelve-three years of age , last five decades .
In the age he is an inspiration for all those who are interested in cleanliness .
Several adventurous beauty of Bila Dar .
We believe that my beloved country , future history , past history is born .
This time Nanaji Portuguese , Pandit Deen Dayal is also the year of the century .
What is the center of all these Mahapuras .
One common thing in everyone is that living for the country , doing something for the country .
Leaving the life of the royal family of Nanaji country , leaving the royal life of the royal family , it is natural to have the pride of their village program .
The former President of India, Shri Abdul Kalan, spoke to the youngsters about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh every time.
Like Mahatma Gandhiji the Din Dayal meditation of Din Dayal meditation also used to talk about the person sitting in the last row of the society .
We also run ahead for unity , one 's mantra .
The unity in diversity is usually telling us the speciality of our India .
We respect the diversity but sometimes you try to feel this diversity .
Deepawali falls near Deepawali is so much in the thought of traveling somewhere in the country .
It is common to go to every tourist .
But it is a matter of pain that people do not see our country , they do not know the diversity of the country .
Our country is filled with many diversity .
All these Mahabhavs have also been expansively tourist in the country .
Before starting this work , trying to understand India , understanding the country .
India has tried to live in itself .
My experience is that I have got the opportunity to go to more than five hundred districts of India .
In more than four hundred districts I got the opportunity to spend at night .
Besides not only declaring unity in diversity, I wish all of you to feel this huge India and our immense strength.
One India - best India is hidden in it .
This is the biggest power of our country tourism .
My hearing is that you want to go out in your holidays , do not know anything other than Kosmo Baaldera , understand , go out with the purpose of learning .
Watch India inside you.
Your life is rich with these experiences .
Your thought is large .
There is cost of cost of experiences .
Normally from October to March is good for tourism .
Definitely send your photo to the incredible.
Send pictures of humans connected to the place you go .
Not only the construction of the construction , not only the beauty of the nature but also about the lifestyle there .
Could you keep it incredibly
You see, I would like to tell the government that the government had to make a public literature about the seven places that have come from one state to each other.
The Government of India definitely works on them .
The government will accept the information of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the beauty of the best places .
Come on, walk with me.
You can also become a big excitement for encouraging the time of March in the month of October to use in the tourism of the country .

My beloved countrymen , many things shake me like a man .
My mind recognizes .
They leave deep effect on my mind .
As much as I am also a man like you .
It is said that Assammans say that while serving the mother of India their husbands were not heaven .
In small age if the time becomes chest then how will we imagine their internal condition .
With the eleven months she trained her hard industry , to make her husband dreams fulfilled her life .
Although the husband of Dubey had forgotten death by working in the army of Dubey .
His wife also reached in the army .
It is natural for every Indian to have the pride of our mother 's power , our pride towards these virgins .
I am telling many good wishes of these two brothers with heart .
They gave new inspiration to crores of people of the country and new excitement.
These two brethren are many opinions .
My dear countrymen , Navratri festivals , Deepawali festivals have a big opportunity for our country .

My dear countrymen , Navratri festival is held .
Durgadevi is worshipped .
The whole environment is sacred , fragrant .
There is an atmosphere filled with spiritual atmosphere , festival environment , devotion .
This is considered to be the festival of energy .
These are also called Shard Navratri . Till now the winters start .
O my beloved countrymen , bow down to Sadar .
On the one hand, the country is drowned in festivals and on the other hand it is natural to worry about the country when there is a positive news from some corner of India.
This is the country of Sardar Patel , the birthplace of Lord Buddha , Gandhi 's birthplace .
' Ahimsa Parmo Dharamshala ' . We came to hear it from a small time .
I have also said from the Red Fort - I have said that there is no harm in the name of beliefs, it is a traditional belief, it is a traditional belief, it is a belief of the political thoughts, it is a belief of a person, it is a traditional belief.
According to the state given to us Baba Saheb Ambedkar , every person has all kinds of arrangements to get justice .
It is said that those who take the chatti in their hands , who are sufficient , who are a person , who do not bear this country . I believe that no government can bear any government .
Our festivals are also filled with many diversity .
Because of the archaeological culture of some thousand years we got the heritage of cultural traditions , social traditions , historical incidents , everything in the year , if one day is not drowned with any festival .
All our festivals also come according to nature .
Everything is also directly related to nature .
Jain society is celebrated throughout the year .
The Jain society celebrates the festival of men in the month of Bhadrapa .
The festival of Purushu festival is held on the last day of the year .
Actually this is a unique tradition .
Year festival is a symbol of fortune , non-vegetarian , friendly feelings .
My beloved countrymen , today everybody of the country is celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi festival .
On coming to Ganesh Chaturthi it is natural to come to Bahraang - Ganesh Festival .
Balgangadhar Tilak had given birth to this tradition of 125 years ago which was symbol of freedom struggle before independence .
After independence they stand symbol of social education , social consciousness .
Ganesha Chaturthi festival is done for ten days .
This festival is said to be a symbol of unity , equality , cleanliness .
Several ruins of the Ganesh Festivals of all the country .
Now Omam Festival is celebrated in Kerala .
Among the colorful festivals of India Onam of Kerala is a major festival .
This festival tells social , cultural importance .
Onam Festival presents an important cultural heritage of Kerala .
This festival will create new enthusiasm, new hopes and new faith in the minds of the people with the message of love and harmony in the society.
Now our festivals are also changing their attractions .
In Gujarat, Navratri Festivals and Durga Puja Festivals in Bengal have turned into their attractions.
Our other festivals are also useful for attracting foreigners .
Think what we can do in that direction .
In the tradition of these festivals ' Id-ul-Juha ' festival is held in a few days .
Congratulations and best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Id-ul-Juha.
Festival meaning belief is a symbol of faith , belief .
In Navbharat country festivals should be made symbols of cleanliness .
This is not new for us but it is important to change it into a social habit .
Cleanliness is not only in the house but also in the entire village , city , city , state , cleanliness , cleanliness in our country .
My favorite country , modernity is changing .
Nowadays, how many cultures, however modern your thoughts are new, all these have become a new corner, a new measure, a balance to go to Berizz.
Therefore in the days of this festival all the places the suitable soil of environment has started .
If you see in Europe , then in every house children are making soil dynasty and coloring it .
Some vegetables colored , some colored papers are being pieces .
The media house is also giving inspiration , guidance to the people giving training to the education of making the idols of soil according to the highest environment .
See how big change has come .
Funny change.
As I said , our country is filled with marvellous thoughts of crores of crores .
Somebody gets very enjoyed by doing new discoveries .
Some engineer himself told me , he got some special kinds of soil , mixing it , giving training to the people making soil .
After worshiping the idol melts immediately in the water by putting that bath in a small bucket .
Three Christians I started the clean garden , whose coming to October is completed three times .
The consequences of this park are seen according to Taluku .
Construction of silver has been reached from 39 to about 67.
It is said that more than two lakh three thousand villages , Bahrang had been freed from excretion .
In the meanwhile, there were severe floods in Gujarat.
Many people lost their lives .
But after the water of flood the foul smell spread very much .
At such a time, at Dhanera in Banaskanta district of Gujarat, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind workers cleaned the flood affected twentieth and three mosques in Dussehra.
He saved everyone by sweating .
If the attempts done by dedicated to the hustle-bustle then our country can fly from the height of the other country .
In one way Deepawali , Navratri , Durga Puja it is considered to be possible before worshipping .
Go to the nearby bushes , go to the nearby village but do this as a garden .

"Prime Minister Garu, I am indefinitely speaking from Pune.
I want to tell about my friend .
She is trying to help people when she is in an attempt but a habit of her own .
I went to shopping mall once with myself.
On one pus he spent two thousand rupees easily .
Piza had kept 450 rupees but the shopping mall was done for five rupees with the auto driver .
Bermadi 4,5 rubbers were left on one vegetable .
I did not like it .
Not only this , if you go to buy pus in Shorum then Berlad but if someone comes to work with poor then there will be no unconsciousness .
Do ye ever think that the poor does not want to do anything
There is no importance of two rupees , five rupees in your life , but your small habit can hurt your mind so deeply .
I thank you, Madam, for telling me through your phone call.
It is believed that my people of my country also have a habit of preference with their poor , they definitely change .

Play FIFA in computer but also in the external field sometimes show fitness with football .
Cricket keeps playing in computer but in the open plains cricket playing cricket is different .
At one time the children of the house went out , when they asked .
Now the situation is that even children in the house are drowned in seeing phones , carton films or mobile games .
Young friends, the Ministry of Sports has created a sports talent search portal to enhance the talent of sports.

A researcher , I have special interest in the economic objects related to the financial inclusion , which are related to it .
My dear countrymen, 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana', 'Financial Inclusion' and 'Economic Region' have been discussed for scholars from all over the world, not only in India.
On 28th August I started this proposal with one eye of my mind .
Tomorrow, on 28th August, this Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed three years.
With this the new families of three crore new families opened the Khatas , Bank Khatas .
This number is more than the population of many countries in the world .
He has changed his habit and he is going to the bank.
But now because of the environment formed slowly he also comes to work for the needs of the children .
It is understood that in the days of coming if something good work is done then money comes to work .
The poor now seeing the rupe card of his pocket , seeing himself as rich , if there is a crade card in his pocket , then it is satisfied that there is a card in my pocket .
It considers itself glorious .
In the prime minister Jan Dhan Yojana approximately 65 thousand crores of rupees have been deposited in the banks .
In one way this is their strength in the days of the poor .
Who has become expensive by the prime minister Jan Dhan Yojana , they have also got the benefit of Bima .
On occurrence of danger of poor people , if the main person dies in the family , they get two lakh rupees in a few days .
Jan Dhan Yojana , Insurance Valla , Rupee card , Prime minister Mudra Point , ordinary people have done survey .
I try to reach them to you .
Due to such inspiring incidents the media can also get complete benefit .
By prasading the face of such people new generations can give new inspiration .
My dear countrymen, once again forgive all of you if you are in pain.
In rainy season the mind of man is very negative .
Animals , birds , stairs , nature , everybody changes into excitement due to rainy season .
With the changing weather cycle, there is a change in environment and its effect is also very fast.
In the last few days, natural calamities have to be faced due to excellence in Assam, North-Eastern regions of India, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal.
My friends of the Council of Ministers are also reaching the place wherever possible.
The state governments also provide the best help to the afflicted with floods in their methods .
In such a situation the help of people is helping them with social institutions , cultural institutions , services .
The Government of India is often happy to help their lives in such a time when the soldiers of Military Jawans , Air Force , A . . . . . .
Due to floods the life of people becomes very unforgettable .
Fruits , animals , basic facilities , roads , electricity , information meditation etc all are affected .
Especially when our rail brothers , fruits were destroyed then they made plans to do the companies of insurrection companies , especially the institutions of the fruits , climate centres immediately , they made plans to stay in front .
In order to face the situation of flood the control Room Helpline number 1078 continuously works .
People also tell their problems .
Gradually, if we continue to do our work according to these environmental suggestions then we can save ourselves from losses.
When I am ready for the Mansu ki Baat programme, I hope that the people of more than me will be made more.
I heard the proposal of your Chartered Accountants , I was very impressed .
Last month, the same date has come into force in our country Goods and Services Tax.
So can you say whether the government has been coming out of the last months or not
In this matter I want to know your thoughts .
I am very happy and enjoyed when somebody comes out of the poor by telling me how they are getting cheaper in the shopping items because of GST.
Especially the belief on the businessmen of yoga is increasing .
I am considering how much GST has been affected in the transport and logistics sector.
How fast changes occurring , magnificence registeration has created a new belief in the country .
Scientists and technologists of the economy are studying about the use of GST in India and certainly stand before the world as a model.
This is a case study of all the universities of the world .
Because with such a big height , such a great change , with the help of so many crores of people it is a big task to move forward in this huge country , successfully .
Definitely researches on this matter .
All the decisions have been taken concentration by mixing the state , central governments .
The result of the concentration of those concentrations should not fall any kind of weight in the lice .
What was the price of anything before the GST , how much is the price in the new situations that all the things are available in the GST you can know easily through your mobile phones .
How easy , friendly environment has been made between the government , businessmen . It has played an important role in increasing faith between the government .
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Ministries participating in this programme, to all the departments, central governments and state governments.
GST is an important example of the whole country of India .
If you want to say in a way , this is a social organization .
On the second time I am making such a big attempt to victory the fort of all the countrymen of crores of crores .
The beloved country is Vasulara , August i . . the month of Vikranti .
Naturally we started listening to the help of 1 August 1920 .
The uit India Movement was launched on 9th August 1942, which is also called the August Revolution.
On 15 August 1947 independence came to the country .
Seeing a way , all the incidents happening in the month of August are also specially engraved with the history of freedom fighting .
Our new generation should know what happened in August 9th honey in 1942 .
From 1857 to 1942 the people of the country who have been drowned with the freedom struggle for independence, which is an inspiration for the construction of India.
On the invitation of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians led their lives to the flow of the garden with the mantra of 'Do Or Die'.
Lacs of youths stopped their studies , left books .
The great men like Lohia , Jaiprakash Narayan played a big role in the park .
The Cooperation Movement in 1920, the uit India Movement in 1942, showcasing the two forms of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1942, the rapidity of the movement has increased in the form of a help prevention movement and a great man like Mahatma Gandhi has also given the mantra of "Du R Die" and there is a gain behind the people.
Sometimes I believe that if the history of India roams once , then the first freedom struggle of India started in 1857 .
Then the beginning freedom struggle of 1942 is happening in some corner of the country .
This long period has created independence in the minds of the people of the country .
Everybody was ready to do something or the other .
This industry , culture done in 1857 reached the last stage of 1942 .
The ueen India park has changed so much that in the other five decades the English had to leave the country in 1947 .
In 1857 AD this independence reached all the people of this independence .
In 1942 AD along with the five decades of 1947 all the people were decided with one mind , determination to give freedom to the country successfully .
These five are like a turn .
Now I will mix you with a guest house .
In 1947 we got freedom .
Now 2017.
Approximately fifty years were spent .
Governments came .
Arrangements have been made , Marai , Pengui , increasing .
Everybody tried to get out of the problems of the country .
I saw that the five dates situated in 2017 to 2022 were also associated with the conservation of five dates .
Try to complete them .
As from 1942 to 1947, five were milestones for the freedom of the country
These five dates , that is , till 2017 till 2022 . India should also be done for the future of India .
After five decades the independence of the country is celebrated .
Therefore all of us should make a strong determination .
2017 should be done in our contribution year .
Every Indian, social organisations, local organisations, regional organisations, schools, art galleries, different organisations and everybody will resolve for a New India.
Come on, we're part of this Sankalp festival.
If we are not there, we must be online, so now I invite my young friends, my young friends and my young friends to come forward to support them in creative ways to build a New India.
While using technology bring new thoughts , video , posts , blacks , jewellery , new thoughts .
We do not forget this proposal as a population .
In the Narendra Modi App, I will also explore uit India quiz for young friends.
This ueen will be useful to introduce the freedom fighters by connecting with the glorious history of our country .
I believe that you will definitely make a detailed proposal for this effort, spread all the directions.
My dear countrymen, on August 15, the country will get an opportunity to interact with the people of the Red Fort as the Prime Minister of the country.
The voice of hundred crore people from the Red Fort resonates .
Attempts are made to give the form of words to the dreams . In the last three third time on August 15th August I should talk about what things , advice is being given .
This time too, I invite you to MyGov or Narendra Modi App.
In the last three August 15 months of August I heard that my delivery takes long time .
Therefore I decided that this time I had decided to reduce my time .
Beloved my country , I proposed another thing .
There is a social economy in the economy of India .
We should never consider it less .
Our festivals , our festivals are not only enjoyable .
Our festivals , our festivals are also social collections .
But along with this our festival is also connected directly with the economic life of Pauri .

I am telling everyone once again .
Its many people gave me a lot of happiness to give recognition .
Everybody has shown enthusiasm to tell their things personally .
I could not read everything , I could not hear at least all the messages of everybody .
But I saw that some attempts were trying to learn music , some attempts are trying to learn new things , some try to learn new things with the help of youth , trying to learn new language .
Some are learning cooking , some are learning dance , some are learning dance , some have started writing poets .
Trying to know about nature , living , understanding direction .
I want to listen to you as well .
That is, I am talking to Diksha Katyal.
I read the habit of reading .
Therefore I decided to read again in these holidays .
When I started reading about the freedom fighting I understood that how many sacrifices have to be fought to give freedom to India , how many sacrifices have to be given , some freedom fighters spent in the jails .
The residue of Kirti singing done in small age was influenced by me .
Therefore, I would like to give you a message to the youth about this thing.
It gives me great pleasure to show our youth interest in knowing about the history of our country, our freedom fighters and those who laid down their lives for the country.
The great men who counted their youth had lost their youth in jail .
In freedom fight those great men who were spent in the jails reading , writing etc . have done very big work .
We know that all those creations have also given a lot of strength to India 's independence .
Many years ago I went to see the Cellular Jail of Andaman - Nicobar .
They came to the walls of the poets .
He was bound in the dark room .
Freedom lovers have experienced such things .
When I read the book 'Maji Janmathe' of Savarkar, I was keen to see the Cellular Jail.
There is also a light and sound show which is very inspiring.
I must say to the youngster of the country that if people have experienced anything for the freedom that we have achieved, if they go to the Cellular Jail, why do they call Kalapani then they will come there.
If you can also go to this pilgrimage area related to our freedom fight in a way .
People of my beloved country , June is a Monday in 5 months .
If you want to say another thing then bac to Basics.
If you want to see nature then increase better plant .
Who can tell this thing better than Mahatma Gandhi
Mahatma Gandhi many times said that 'one must care about a world one will not see'.
That is , we should also think about the world that we do not see , take precaution .
You must have seen that the power of nature is that when one glass of water comes out very tired then how fresh it comes to the mouth .
On getting tired very tired the room opens the windows , opening the doors , after swallowing the fresh air new consciousness comes .
Therefore the world attempt to finish with the nature of June is also our own attempt .
Our ancestors have now been available as a result of protecting environment .
It is said that the reason of cleanliness of us is Prithvi .
It is a matter of lighting on the head of Buddha , that the birth of Lord Buddha , his wisdom , his great man was under one tree .
Reading , reading , reading , city residents , tribals , tribals , everyone is naturally a part of their social life .
But we need to connect this thing with modern thoughts , modern thoughts .

Plants are planted in crores .
Yoga is not only exercise .
Keeping in mind the Yoga Day celebrations of two days ago, I will come to all the governments of the world and all the people of the world.

Gradually the tasks move forward in that direction .
It is a very interesting advice .
Get the photographs done by putting yogasanas together with mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , mother , sons , daughters , daughters , daughters , three generations .
Today , today , to morrow this beautiful yoga gives a new dimension to yoga . I thank those who have given this advice .
It is a matter of great interest that we have achieved a good experience through the 'Self with Dotter' policy.
These three generations of yogasana definitely give the exhibition of the country , world .
Three generations where they have done yoga , they will definitely send me photographs of yogasana together .
In a way it is considered a positive health care park .
Since then I have visited various kinds of events in India today .
As soon as I returned , I saw that some were doing very minute Modi , where are Modi going
If you hear this phone call then it will be understood to you .
Modi Garu , I have often seen in the midst of T . . . social media media that people are taking special attention to cleanliness everywhere you go .
On the occasion of Mumbai , Surat . people are accepting cleanliness as a big job .
Cleanliness Taluku published from Kashi Ghat has become a garden with your inspiration . ' Your words are true .
Somewhere I go to the government program , but in the middle of this society also cleanliness has become a festival .
Five days before I go, seven days ago, ten days ago, very big cleanliness programs take place.
All these things of the country are so careful that you can imagine how much joy you can imagine this thing .
I also congratulate all those who encourage this cleanliness program.
Someone has given me some advice .
Actually the advice is very good .
I do not even know whether I can do it .
Modi Garu, when you decide on your tourism, what kind of tourism do you want to say to him ' Babu, how much will your cleanliness be
The treatment is very good but I should think .
But make such a garden which is very good thing to clean so many things by giving them prizes .
By doing this many people become victims of diseases .
With the help of the state governments, with the help of the presidents of the cities, the Government of India has decided to initiate an important programme for the construction of vains.
On the occasion of June 5 World Environment Day , about 4 thousand cities of the country are available in the form of liquid , liquid form .
Both kinds of dirt are available . One green colored diabetes , other blue colored diabetes .
All these work properly in the fields . keep in mind that the fields are green , what is in the leaf of green leaf .
The second kind of garbage , iron , iron , glass , clothes , plastic , polythene , broken diabetes , rubber , metal etc . come to the dry department by putting them in instruments .
In the last few days, you must have heard that Versova Beach, which is said to be a waste place in Mumbai, has now become a clean and beautiful Versova beach.
Approximately eighty-nine weeks the residents of the city had changed the form of this Versova beach . After removing the garbage of thousands of tonnes from that place the Versova beach has become clean , beautiful .
Its full responsibility has been taken by Versova Resident Volunteer (VRV ) .
Shri Afroz Shah was engaged in this work from October 2015 and gradually the programme became a big and public movement.
In the last fifteen months of my beloved country , in the last fifteen months of the last fifteen months , T . . . Chanels , Soshil media , three-three calculations of the government have been seen .
Three years ago, you gave me the responsibility of 'Prime Service'.
Many surveys , opinions have been done .
I accept all these procedures as healthy information .
In every test all these three feet have been tested .
Every part of the society has discovered it .
There is an excellent process in democracy .
I am also thankful to all those who have given special feedback .
On coming to the light of depth , Lopalu there is a chance of correcting them .
The thing is good , some good , bad , somebody learning from it , walk ahead with it in the evening .
Constructional examination gives strength to democracy .
It is necessary for a supreme country, a conscious country.
This is the same thing that many families were written to me .
One person , one ordinary Pauri has increased this incident with my enthusiasm .
Even if sitting in such a big place, I would like to embarrass the Honourable President, the Vice President and the Speaker for giving such importance to Mansu in Mansu.
In a way, the Mansu Ki Baat programme has given a new dimension.
Some of our friends were also discussing with me while working on this book in Mansu.
I'm lying down to Akbar.
The beloved people of my country , this time we keep raining all around the country . environment changes .
Come , all of us walk ahead while loveing nature in this environment .
My generation is many blessed , blessed .
People of my beloved country , Namaskar .
Perhaps arrangements , people have become habit of these problems .
Children 's curiosity , youths , experience of elders etc . are coming in my sight .
On the bus while traveling in the train someone gets cough , immediately someone comes and gives advice to somebody .
It is said that advice , suggestions are in our nature .
To reach me , to give advice many people do something in their life .
With some good tasks they keep changing their intelligence , energy , capacity according to the situation .
Some people have told their advice at the place of working , the rest of the people who have heard that they have become a complete form and they also give advice to everyone with the purpose of changing their advice .
Not only this when I proposed something then it becomes very happy to remember such things .
After that, many people from all corners of the country of Narendra Modi App and MyGov have made a creative effort to see food waste.
Some videos were also sent to me .
There are road banks at some places .
May is the establishment of the states of Maharashtra , Gujarat .
This conclusion is many luxuries of the people of these two states .
Both the states have consistently tried to cross many new development peaks .
In both the states the continuous efforts of Mahapurush , every kind of society of society keep on giving us their life .
While reminding these great men , on the day of independence of the state on the day of independence i . . 2022 we should bring all our states , all our society , all our cities , all our families .
Make a plan to prepare this contribution . walk ahead with the help of all the people .
On the other hand these two states are my luxury .
In our country the rapidity of summers staying in the months of May , June this time has to be felt in the month of April .
Therefore this time when I consult advice in mind , maximum advice has been given to take any precaution in this summer .
All these are also not new but it is also good to remember them at the right time .
It is said that Balkani had to keep water for birds , Daba Pana , birds .
In many families small children have also seen this work .
Once in the sight of this work comes in the sight of those people , the birds come ten times a day or there is no water in the pot .
This gives us some sports but in reality it is a marvellous experience to lift the feeling of feeling in the mind .
Although in our country things related to animal birds , natural life with nature are very well known but it is necessary to give strength to such efforts .
When I was the main minister of Gujarat then David Bohra Samaj had come to the dharamshala of the Saiyadana of the dharamshala of the dharamshala .
They lived an hundred three times .
For the festivals of their hundredth birthday Bohra society has run a very big garden to preserve the pinnacles by their Burhani Foundation .
I got the opportunity to start it .
They sent approximately 50,000 bird feders to all over the world.
This was also approved in the Guinn Book of World Records.
Sometimes we become so much unsuccessful that those who put paper , milk , vegetables , Post Man , in such a summer days somebody drinks good water in the dome .
Youth friends , I want to tell some things with you also .
In our youth many people like to spend life in comparison to comparison to the comparison of our youth .
Mothers are also reigning their alternative in a safe environment .
There are also people living different from this but most of the people living in the computer zone are seen .
Now the tests are done , to enjoy the bags .
After summers the cosmetics remain well after the summers .
I want to tell your summer shells like a friend .
Somebody definitely use it , it is believed that I am .
If you want to go to the place without listening , seeing , thinking , unknowing .
Try new places , new experiences , new experiences .
I want to know that why is your interest in these summer holidays then try to know them .
Use new use .
Use should be positive . You should take you out of your comfort zone .
We are of the middle class . happy families .
What is the matter of those travellers , what will they do after getting down at the station
In the evening go to the bus terminus with your football , Wali Bal or other sports objects .
Play yourself with those poor children , then see that in that game you will get the joy of never getting in life .
If there is a chance of playing such a life in the society then what kind of change comes in their life .
I can say with confidence that if you go once again then I will like to go again .
This experience will teach you a lot .
To reduce the technology , to reduce the borders , but its adverse effect has changed as if six people living in one house are also in one room but to imagine the fare between them are also imagined with me .
Can you try to spend time with you away from technology
If we pay attention to the country full of many varieties then we get to learn something in our surroundings .
If you do not come to swimming , learn swimming , do not come to the best balcony then try to go to some or the other person hidden in you .
If we feel small tasks then sometimes we can not learn some tasks of our mind .
You can learn to walk on the car but whenever you want to learn to walk auto rickshaw .
You might have come to cycle , but never try to move the tri-chakra vehicle carrying people .
You see, these new efforts , new expertise can not only give you happiness , but can also pull your life out of it tied in one condition .
Keep showing your friends indraja .
I am told by my experience , we can not even imagine how much learning the world , how much we can not imagine .
New places , new villages , new cities , new villages , new villages , new places .
But in front of going wherever we go , you try to see a gynaecology , knowing , asking people , asking them , seeing those places is different .
Therefore you will get the opportunity to learn how much .
Friends , this time the Government of India has also given you a good opportunity .
New generations are getting rid of the river.
They do not need the river .
They started believing digital consciousness .
Do you also believe  But do you ever think that you can get through this plan
The Government of India has made a plan .
Have you been loading down the BHIM app
Send it to each other .
If you are spent with twenty people in the day then you will get two rupees in the evening .
This plan is implemented till 14th October .
Thus, you will be able to build Digital India.
New India becomes one of yourself .
Wildlife sanctuary , sanctuary .
Refer .
Normally there is an adverse environment of W . . . culture in our country .
Now the red light on the vehicles is also not able to say that the red light entering the brain has come out .
I am talking to Shiva Choubey from Prime Minister Garu and Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
I'd like to talk about the government's decisive red beacon night ban.
I felt very proud to read it .
Now my time has also been enjoyed as much as my time .
I don't want to interfere in the traffic jam.
For this decision I will tell you the blessedness of my heart .
Red Light Red Fort is a part of the arrangement by the government decision .
The importance of EPIs in place of VIPs in the country is a New India spirit.
In place of VIP, EPI says that my feeling is clear that every person is important.
Every person has an important importance , every person has an important importance .
If we accept the importance of 125 crore people of the country , then how big power is to fulfil the greatest dreams of 125 crores of the country .
Do this work together .
People of my beloved country , we will always remember our history , our culture , our tradition again and again .
Therefore we get energy , inspiration .
This year all the residents of 125 crores of our country are celebrating their thousand Jayanti .
Because of some reason we are so much that we are thinking as small as we think that most of the centuries are thinking .
Please imagine .
It is also difficult to come out by bringing out the social contracts .
How was it before the same thousands
Ramayana dynasty had done very big fight against the evil , description , unconsciousness , species etc . of the society during his time .
They were embraced by their own self-confidence , whom the society is embraced .
Before thousands he got permission to enter the house , to enter the house , to enter the house .
In every age it is our fortune to keep the evil of the society from our society to end the evil of that time .
Today, we celebrate the thousandth birth anniversary of Ramayana, we will inspire him in our efforts to enhance social unity and inspire him.
To morrow the Government of India has released a Tapala binding in the memory of Swami Ramayana .
I am telling the prayers of Swami Ramjacharya , I am dedicated .
My dear countrymen , to morrow there is another speciality of one Tarikh .
It is celebrated in many places in the world as the Day of Labour.
On coming to the day of the workers , when the churches were discussed about the workers , then it is natural to remember Babasaheb Ambedkar .
If I say about Babasaheb Ambedkar , Swami Ramjacharya , then the monument of the twelfth century of Karnataka , the society of the society of the society of Karnataka is also reminded of Basaveshwar .
In the twelveth century he had deep thoughts on the subject of labour and labour in Kannada language.
And he said unto him , Kai Kailas in Kannada .
It means that you can achieve the Kailas of Shiva's house with your industry.
That is , heaven is obtained by doing work .
If you want to say in the other word , then Shiva .
It is natural to remind me of Dattupat Tangdi dynasty while talking about the workers .
People of my beloved country , in some days we celebrate Buddhapurni .
All the followers of Lord Buddha celebrate festivals worldwide .
I am fortunate to celebrate Vesak Day by the United States on the day of Buddha Purnima.
This seventh is celebrated in Sri Lanka .
On this sacred day I get the opportunity to offer the residence of Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka .
The opportunity to remind their memories is available .
My dear countrymen, I have always tried to move forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' in India.
When India is called 'Sabka Saath-Sabka Vikas', it is not only in India but also in the world.
Especially our two neighbouring countries are also described .
Our two neighbouring countries should be supported , development should be done for them .
Several uses are done .
On May 5 India has used South Asia museum .
This museum is capable of ability , how much useful is to fulfil the economic , developmental priorities of South Asia .
This museum will collaborate with the efforts of mutual interaction between the people of natural forests , tele-medicine Ina , electronic science ina , higher technologies and people .
People of my beloved country , sunshine are fast . Save them , save you .
Most of the families of the country are staying in the tests of their children .
In the families of those whose tests there is an atmosphere of cosmetic environment , examination in the families of testing .
At such a time, I can tell myself alone, listen to what I said to the students in Mansulo Vadak for the past.
In a historical war against unrighteousness Bangladesh has been successful in the leadership of Bangladesh .
On such a special day independent Bangladesh 's brothers , brothers , brothers , brothers , brothers and sisters want to go ahead in the development of Bangladesh .
Bangladesh is a strong friend, a good friend with you and India will continue to provide full support to you in the direction of development by protecting peace and security in the entire region.
Our memories of Ravindranath Tagore are pride with the heritage of our two countries .
Because Bangladesh is the creation of our Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore .
One interesting thing about Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1913, he was the first person to confer the Nobel Prize.
In 1919 when the British created the Maranhom in Jalianwala Bagh then Rabindranath Tagore is also one among the great men who were opposite to them .
This incident is the time of showing strong effect on the mind of a twelve children .
In the childhood to play this Jalianwala Bagh has given an inspiration to the life of that child .
In 1919 that small Bhagwan situated in the twelveth century is the beloved of all us , the martyr of the martyr Bhagat Singh standing inspiration .
These three days Christian March 23th honey Bhagat Singh Nu , he two other friends Sukhdev , Rajguru were climbed to Ukamba .
We all know that without the death of this incident Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru , without the death of three , the happiness of the mother of India is left .
Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru are also not able to keep the stories of life in Akshay .
The empire of Javat was afraid of these three .
When they were in jail , how was the British thought with them .
Therefore nobody had to fulfil the training of 24th honey in the month of March , March 23th honey training was done .
Besides this their dead bodies were thirsty by bringing them to the Punjab region .
Many years ago when I went to that place for the first time there was a kind of light in my body .
Whenever I get the opportunity, I will suggest to the youth of the country that the mothers of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru and the tombs of Batokeshwar and the tombs of Batokeshwar go to Punjab.
At that time it is called for independence , its rapidity , its amount is increasing .
On one hand the soldiers like Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru inspired the youth for the revolution of the war .
On the 10th day of April 1917 AD Mahatma Gandhi had done the truth of Mahatma Gandhi on the 10th day of April .
This is the year of Champaran Satyagraha Century .
In the freedom fight of India Gandhi Vad , Gandhiji 's behavior style of Gandhiji was known at the time of Champaran for the first time .
Specially this incident is a milestone in the entire journey of fighting for freedom from the Taluku method .
At this time, Champaran Satyagraha, Kheda Satyagraha, Mill Carms of Ahmedabad, all of them have a strong impact on the thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi and behavior style.
A man who returned to India in 1915 was only two functions.
The power to know the society of the people, the strength to know the society of the Indian society, the poor people of the British empire, the negative people of the British empire, to fight, to inspire them to fight, to bring them into the market for fighting, to fight, to see the magnificent powers of Mahatma Gandhi, so we can see the world of Gandhiji.
If you know about Gandhiji at the time of the Champaran Satyagraha happening in one hundred years , then how much a person starts living ordinary life is to know the truth of Champaran Satyagraha .
How to start ordinary life , how much industry itself , how much Gandhiji had done Gandhiji .
We had sent the village of Gandhiji at the same time all the big descending ground like Rajendra Babuji , Acharya Kripalani .
In the work of people mixed with people , people taught it the color of freedom fighting .
A wonderful balance is in the style of Gandhiji .
In order to bring change the desire of an hundred crore people , attempts , these are the foundation of new India , India .
There's a wish, a resolve, a enthusiasm.
O my beloved countrymen , if we come out of the lives of Kasta , seeing the activities happening in the society with cosmetics , seeing what happens around the society , if we try to understand , then the goals will be determined to keep doing something for the society , not only for the society , for the society , for the society .
That is also like a penance , meditation , like a three service they are doing their work .
There are many people going to the hospital everyday .
There are some people running along with blood donation .
Those who give food to food habits are somebody .
Once seeing it in the form of social , incidents it is known with such a big power .
All these are not celebrated with budget evening , government projects , government funds .
But when you look at the country, the dream of a New India of the people of hundreds of crores of people of the country will be realized in front of our eyes.
It is said that every Pauru should be fulfilled the responsibilities .
Then the same New India starts a hustle-bustle .
2022 Kalla came to India 75 years after coming to India . Bhagat Singh , Sukhdev , Rajguru .
We recognize the truth of Champaran .
Would we also participate in the journey from Swarajya to Surajya by regularizing our lives
In the last few months the environment of our country is situated in our country , very big people have participated in the designs , designs .
After the rubbing of mouth one can see a lot of increase in various kinds of designs .
About one and a half crore people have downloaded this app for two-and-a-half months since the launch of Bhima Yap.
We have to move forward to fight against the people of my country , black wealth , which are celebrating water .
Can the people of an hundred crore people of the country imagine that during this year two and a half thousand crores of digital lavadevis can be celebrated
We declared in the budget.
This work done for the people of an hundred crore people of the country has not been done for one year .
You can complete in six months .
All these can be done in daily life .
Because of this you can not imagine how much you can serve the country . Black wealth , which can change your soldiers in fighting water .
For giving all these to the people , for making people aware of people many programs have been done in the last few days .
Hundreds of such programs have been concluded in Jawad country .
80 - 85 programs have been done .
The multicoloured multicoloured for businessmen were fifty thousand .
Everybody had concluded this work ahead .
Earlier April 14th April Dr . Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti this Disease fair is concluded .
On the completion of hundred days a big last program was celebrated .
The biggest drag is determined in it .
I believe that Dr . Babasaheb Ambedakar Jayanti is so much time left with us , so much time Bhim Yap is being published .
To reduce the dryness of the river , to reduce the behavior with the mouths .
My dear countrymen, I am happy to have several kinds of consultations when I ask for advice for Mansulo Vadak.

I want to tell people how important cleanliness .
I will travel everyday on a river polluting people very dirty .
Our house comes on the Rispana bridge of that river .
I recognize it properly .
I want to dream of unconsciousness in the minds of hundred crores of people .
Once anger starts , satisfaction starts , we start applying something to do something or the other .
The best , active part is , the garden is so important for them .
But cleanliness is always surrounded by a habit even more than the garden .
I believe that this feeling of living in the youth , students , students in the country , students , youths is a good result .
We know that we have eaten in our house , social feeding also keeps on putting food in our glass .
After putting everything in the glass it becomes difficult to eat .
One can not even put half of them in the stomach , leave there .
Have you ever thought how much harm we are doing by leaving these substances
If you do n't leave by swallowing like this , who can fill the stomach of the poor , do you ever think
It is not a matter of understanding .
It is said that how much food can be eaten in our houses when small children are slain .
But such a thing is that it is also good for family .
They made some mobile yps .
In every state of our country somewhere such people will be seen .
The life of water also gives us support to eat as much as we can .
See , these roads are there for change .
Those who take precaution to the body , health keep a little empty in the stomach , keep a little empty in the glass .

This time Ikrajya Samiti April 7th Tarikh World Health Organisation has been paid attention to depression .
According to one estimation people are suffering from mental depression on 35 crores of the world .
The danger is that in those around us also we have seen this thing that we do not like to talk about this thing .
The person afflicted with depression also does not talk about it because that person is also ashamed to discuss it .
I would like to tell the people of the country that they would not be able to get rid of depression.
On making a psychological environment one starts getting relief .
First mantra is that instead of supplementation x-ray is necessary .
Tell your friends , mothers , mothers , mothers , mothers , teachers , what will your mind open .
Sometimes the children living in the sanctum sanctuary are so difficult for loneliness .
The privilege of our country is that we have grown up in simultaneous families and are mixed with big families so there is no shape of depression.
You believe that they are the first step towards depression .
This is the best solution .
This depression is the cause of physical , mental diseases .
As diabetes is the root of all kinds of diseases , like depression also does not stand , fighting , adventurous decisions , taking decisions .
There is also another method .
When you meet others , when someone serves , then you can easily make the weight of your mind easier .

The flowers of red mood give the message of Holi .
The poet Amir Khus Rose has been described on these moments changing the weather .
And he said , It is said , The flowers of all the gardens , the flowers of the sky , the branches of the branches , the branches of the branches .
When the nature is pleasant , when the environment is pleasant then man also enjoys that environment .
Festivals like Basant Panchmi , Maha Shivratri , Holi etc fill colors of fun in human life .
In the atmosphere of love, brotherhood and humanity, we are going to convey our last month Falguna to welcome Chaitra in the new month.
These two months are the season of Kada spring .
Several people don't know about the use of ISRO in the Narendra Modi App called Shobha Jalan, so you need to use 104 museums and provide some information about the interceptor Missile.
Blessed is your blessedness to remember the glorious example of India .
They have achieved a place that can be achieved through technology, technology, technology and science, to solve poverty, to prevent diseases, to get rid of the world.
The 15th February of February is a glorious day in the lives of Indians.
Our country has done our scientists to lift up the head with pride before the world .
He completed many unparalleled uses in ISRO -LRB- ISRO -RRB- for some time .
The ISRO has recognised the world record in the space sector just a few days after successful experiments such as Mars Mission, Mangal Yan, etc.
Once the history created by sending 104 museums in the space was standing in the first country of India .
It is a matter of enjoying the use of 38th victory of PSL .
This is not only a historic event for ISRO but also for India.
ISRO has become a marvellous event in the world, which has been sustained with the lowest cost.
The scientists of India have displayed this victory with the large heart of the whole world .
Brothers and sisters , the main among these 104 museums is India 's museum cartosat 2 .
These shawls are useful for pictures , wildlife mapping , mauli estimation , development plans , city development plans etc .
Especially for my brothers and sisters wherever the roots of water are in the country , how should they use them , and what are the main things to keep in mind , cartosate helps us .
Some pictures were sent while going to our Shatlet .
That started his work only .
It is a matter of enjoyment that all this program has been done by our young scientists , women scientists .
Youth , women , this strong participation is a glorious thing in the victory of Isro .
I am telling the scientists of ISRO to all the people of the country .
For people , for the service of the country , for the purpose of using space science , for the service of the country they also keep new records everyday .
Our scientists , how many adventurous we told how many adventurous we were less .

In the security of India Ballistic International Missile has also been tested successfully .
Interception technology their tuberculosis has achieved Kuppakulchi victory by identifying the tuberculosis of the enemies from the height of 100 kilometres from the ground.
Our scientists have seen this .
And its strength is that if any tuberculosis comes to attack India from a distance of 2000 kms, then our tuberculosis has the power to destroy it in space itself.
On seeing new technology , when we get some new victory then we get enjoyed .
Jijnas has played an important role in the journey of human life Taluku development .
Special scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific science .
The same gynaecology becomes the reason of new research .
Their questions are not able to sleep , neither do they sleep .
If we discover the journey of human life for thousands of years then we can say that this human life is not so much for the journey of Taluku development .
It is impossible .
Everything , creation regularly , man 's mind keeps trying to know the mind .
Although every new technology , new science gives birth to a new age .
My beloved young men, science and scientific professionals, when we talk about the hard-working industries, I have been telling us that many times in Mann Ki Baat, we have been enhancing the attraction of science in our youth.
There is a need of many scientists of the country .
Today scientists are the reason of a permanent change in the lifestyle of the coming generation .
Mahatma Gandhi says no science has dropped the sky in a perfect form.
Scientists should always keep in mind the needs of ordinary people , how to use their principles naturally , how much useful is the need of any technique , because the common man is very beneficial .
I have seen how important work they have done to identify such creative creatures , exhibitions , to give information to people , how to produce such creative objects , how big heights should be produced , how much they have done .
I saw a discovery of Italy .
In 2005 there were heavy rains in Mumbai .
Its meaning is that in the society , in the country , people playing this kind of role are very slow .
Our society is also very different in the direction of technology .
All the arrangements are also running in the direction of technology .
In a way technology has become a different part of our lives.
In the last few days the gynaecology of Digi-Dhan is very strong .
Gradually people move forward towards digital conservation leaving the river .
Digital Ladwa Devis are also developing very fast in India .
Especially youngsters are habit of making their designs from their mobile phones .
I am considered to be a symbol of this .
A few days ago, in our country, the 'Laki Grahak Yojana' and 'DG-Business Yojana' have got a huge contribution.
Through these two schemes, an attempt has been made to transform rivers into a mass movement in India.
In this plan more than a hundred Khatadas have been obtained according to lakh rupees .
More than four thousand traders got prize according to fifty thousand .
Or if I ask the descriptions of this poisonous description , then I have also enjoyed knowing that apart from fifteen years of age there are also sixty-five years old .
Expressing his joy from Mysore to Shri Anand Pal, he said that he received a thousand rupees prize in the Laki Grahak Yojana in the Narendra Modi App.
And it came to pass , when I had received a thousand rupees , that the lice of the lice found me , that I gave her a thousand rupees .
Everybody keeps telling about digital related things .
How much enthusiasm is encouraged , others are also encouraged .
The puja reading Pizzi of Maharashtra is also a young friend who is also used in his family , how much enjoys it , how much enjoys it , how much enjoys its experiences with his friends .
It is said that how precious to come to Lakshadweep , he took it a garden , encourages others for this .
In my view , everybody related to this work is a new team in this country .
One way you're clean soldiers.
April is a dragon situated at a price of 14 crores .

This year approximately two thousand seven hundred lakh tonnes of food grains have been produced in the country .
This time 8  more than the Namoda Record named our rails is emotional .
This is the success of ever .
I am specially impressed the rails of the country .
Because they kept in mind the poor people besides traditional fruits , various kinds of pulses cooked cereals because poor people provide the most protein with pulses .
Keeping in mind the need of the poor people of the country near about two hundred and fifty lakh hectares of land various kinds of pulses have made me very pleasant .
This is not only the production of various kinds of pulses , but the great service done to the poor people of my country .
My prayer , my hearing , my country ' s rails have produced records of pulses , so my brothers and sisters are specially impressed .
My dear countrymen, by the government of our country, by the society, by the society, by the institutions, everybody has been working in a clean direction.
In a way everybody looks immensely behavioured about cleanliness in some form.
The government is also constantly trying .
Six house toilet pits were empty , healed them .
Twin Pit Toilets were empty , then the rulers had seen themselves to use those toilets again .
How do we clean other cleanses , these toilets can also be cleaned in such a way .
Because when an I . . . ruler cleansed the toilets himself then it is natural to attract the people of the country .
It has also been proved .
The family of six members is filled with a Standard Twin Fit Toilet in five dates .
After that the jewellery can be easily turned into another pit .
In six to twelve months the waste reached in the toilet ghee is completely burnt .
The way the government takes this information , others also use such information .
Clean bird festivals continue to be held in various parts of the government also .

The matter related to sports , space related to space women of our country do not take anyone .
While stepping in foot they are moving ahead . they are increasing the country with their victory .
Our country's women sportspersons won the silver medal in the Asia Ragbi Sevens Trophy in the midst of this event.
My heartfelt greetings to all of them.
On March 8th honey the whole world also celebrates the day of women .
Beti Bachao- Beti Padhao movement has been moving forward at a rapid pace.
It is not only a government program .
A social movement has become a mass education programme.
In the past two this program attracted the hearts of common people .
This problem of all the corners of the country has thought about the people of this problem .
As soon as the child is born then how enjoys the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically .
In a way the girls increasing towards the girls are the reason of their social swimming .
Children can be stopped by a special program in the Kadlu district of Tamilnadu state .
Nowadays approximately 175 girls were stopped .
Girls Bank Accounts have been opened nearly 55-60,000 under the 'Sukanya Samriddha Yojana' section of the District Administration.

New thoughts are drowned with it .
According to the needs of the province they are changing them .
My dear countrymen, I have sometimes got the opportunity to talk to all of you through the Mansoolo Vadak programme.
You are also active .
I'm gonna know from you.

I will be able to give you this support .
Manki Baat , August 2019 .
Our country is enjoying rain on one side .
On the other hand all the festivals of the roots of Hindustan , the fair of Deepawali keep on taking place .
Perhaps our ancestors, in any situation, the menstrual cycle, the economic cycle, the society, which does not have a depression in the society.
Till now we celebrated many festivals .
The birth of Sri Krishna was done throughout the Hindustan .
If there is such personality , even after spending thousands of years then every festival takes a new sport , takes new energy , can anyone imagine .
Today I am talking to you then two important monasteries are thinking about two great monasteries .
One is Sudarshan Chakradhar , one is Charkhadhar .
And when Sudarshan Chakrath had left the coast of the Yamuna , and went to the sea shore of Gujarat , and was established in the city of Dwarkah , then the majesty that was born on the sea shore came to Yamuna , and spent the last hours of life in Delhi .
Sudarshan Chakradhara Mohan had completely used his intelligence , ability , his scientific thought to stop the war , to stop the war of thousands of years .
At the same time, India is in the forefront of another big festival.
Not only India , this church is happening throughout the world . My dear countrymen .
I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
He had served the rails being recognized in Champaran .
In order to remove many illusions related to blood pitta disease they themselves have served the patients of bile .
Through service itself stands an example of his life .
This thing can be understood easily from the life of Bapuji .
Mahatma Gandhi 's personality , society , humanity was this specially .
Phoenix Farm of Africa , Tol Stay Farm , Sabarmati Ashram , Wardhana , all the places , in one of its special way the society , community mobilization was their devotion .
It is necessary to bring all these feelings of society , society , society community community community mobilization in our business life .
If you want to say the truth then this is the true devotion of Mahatma Gandhi , true work .
We think that we are connected with people in the society , connected with all the classes , connected with all the ages , the village city is a man or the society associated with everyone , I can do something like my attempt .
The cost of the cost of my generation is that it will be good .
Community is our strength .
In the programs happening in the year of 150 January there is also a collection , service .
Our woman is Ladys Club .
We do the work of Ladies Club in the modern era, but all of us together have a service programme with the help of the Ladies Club.
I can do a lot.
The imagination of books , scholar scholars , such 130 crores of Indians , 130 crores can be started .
There is no limit in the mind that if good aspiration, goodwill, goodwill and goodwill are able to serve with complete integrity then it is enough.
It is also comfortable - it is enough for a unique joy.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
Dandi is a very important turn in the fight for freedom.
I participate in the opening ceremony of a modern museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi in Dandi.
By this others also write three-four things while expressing your feelings with photographs .
During the time of coming many programs , competitions , exhibitions have been organised .
But in this context I want to participate with you a interesting thing .
Venice Biennale is a famous art exhibition where artists from all over the world meet.
This time, an interesting exhibition was organised with Gandhi Memorial at the Indian building of Venice Biennale.
In this Haripura Panels is specially interesting .
In the Haripura of Gujarat the conclave of Kangras is celebrated , in which the history of Subhas Chandrabos is reminded of you .
This art panel has a beautiful past.
Prior to the Haripura meeting of Kangras in 1937-38, the then Principal Nandlal Bose of Mahatma Gandhi Shantiniketan Kalabhan was invited.
Gandhiji acknowledged the exhibition of their art work in this meeting to showcase their lifestyle in India through art.
The art work of our kingdom is this Nandal Bose .
The state has given a special identity to the state .
Along with the art gallery of this Bose the art gallery has made itself Amar .
After touring the villages nearby Nandal Bose Haripura , in the end a art canvas was built by showing the life of rural India .
This invaluable art pragma was discussed in Venice.
On the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji, I wish any resolution from every Hindustani along with my best wishes.
Do something for the country , society , others .
That's the right, real authentication of Bapu.
This time it starts from 11 September .
At this time we came out of our house and dedicated the work of Mahatma Gandhi with hard work .
But houses , streets , cotton but sandalwood , but art gallery but in all public places clean garden should be organised .
This time pay more attention to plastic .
It is said that in August 155 crores of people of hundred crores of country were encouraged with enthusiasm , energy . I told that in Bahraang places the work of getting rid of excretion from excretion .
Likewise, let's all join us to stop the single use plastic.
All sections of the society are enthusiastic about this proposal.
This will save money and play an important role in environmental protection.
This time, on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of October 2nd, we will also lay the foundation stone of the public movement against plastic.
I am making an appeal with all the sections of the society, every village and every city residents.
This year Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated to free India from the plastic garbage .
All the municipality , corporation , district administration , village Panchayat government , all the organizations , all the institutions , every citizen of the country have to listen to me that plastic utensils should be done properly .
I inspire all the corporate sectors to discover how to leave the disposal properly if this plastic west is conserved at one place.
It can be recycled .
It can be used in fuel .
Today I want to say a very important thing with a culture .
There is a lot of importance of food in our culture .
As much as we met food in science .
Nutrition in modern scientific methods across the country is becoming a mass movement in the Nutrition Abhiyan.
People are fighting with malnutrition in new interesting ways .
Once one thing came into my point of view .
There was a big garden called cereals in Nasik.
In it in the days of the fruit harvesting the anganga services of anganga harvesting a piece of cereal from the people .
This grain is used to make women , children hot food .
The person donating in this is a aware citizen of the society .
This culture is celebrated while feeding the children for the first time .
Not liquid food .
Gujarat had a thought in 2010 and why should not it be necessary to give complementary food to the children in the context of Annaprasana
This is very important in front of which everybody can participate .
In many states people do food parks .
There is a marvellous view of service , joy .
O friends , by many small ways our country can take effect from fighting with malnutrition .
Today the right information or poor , rich people are also becoming victims of malnutrition .
The month of September is celebrated in the form of Poshan Abhiyan throughout the country.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I felt sure that there would be a lot of questions about this thing.
In the last few weeks, wherever I went, I met the people, there was a proposal about Man Vs Wild.
Since then I did not imagine the opportunity to touch the young hearts of the world in my life .
But what happened .
Last week I went to Bhutan .
As the Prime Minister, whenever I have come to the forefront of going, I would like to ask you one thing about Yoga for five to ten minutes whenever there is a discussion with anyone in the world on International Yoga Day.
Those who do not discuss yoga with me in the big ground of the world . This thing I am telling about the whole world .
Discovery channel has planned this program in 165 countries in their language .
People want to know the churches taken in the direction of climate , clean environment in our country .
But another interesting thing is that some are asking me something while shouting , Modiji , say this . You are talking in Hindi , beer girls do not come to Hindi .
After this do the cost of cooking .
Then what has been done after shooting again .
Very curiosity is questioned .
See , there is no secret in it .
There is this question in many minds . Okay , I tell this mystery now .
Actually this is not mystery .
In fact, technology has been used completely in the debate with Bear Grills.
As soon as I said anything, it was done in English , because of the contrary there was a small card lase in the ears of Beer Grills .
Therefore, if I talk in Hindi then because of being listening to him in English, it was the miracle of technology.
After this show many people are seen discussing about Jim Corbett National Park .
Definitely go to the places of nature, wild animals, living .
What is the nature
You will stay watching .
Your internal color is also huge .
On 15 August I heard you from the Red Fort , at least 15 places in the next three , 15 places in India will be completely tourist centres .
Go, look, study, take the family, spend some time there.
Your thought becomes huge .
My dear countrymen , in India the thought about environment protection , devotion i . . conservation is natural .
In the last month I had the fortune of releasing the population of tiger in the country .
You know how many tigers are in India .
The number of tigers in India is 2967 . two thousand nine hundred and sixty seven .
It was difficult to stay half in this number below the corners .
About the tigers in 2010, a tiger meeting was held in St. Petersburg, Russia.
In which information about reducing the number of tigers has been taken , a contribution has been taken .
The number of tigers of the world of 2022 is that contribution .
But now this is new India . We will fulfil the goals quickly .
We doubled the number of tigers here in 2019 .
Not only tigers in India but also the number of wilderness , community reserves has increased .
I also recognized the Gir lions of Gujarat while releasing tigers.
When I responsible for the main responsibility there the residence of lions in the jungles of Gir .
Their number was decreasing .
We took many churches together in Gir.
In 2007 we decided to make women guards there .
We have enhanced infrastructure for enhancing tourists.
Whenever we talk about nature , wild animals then the conservation of conservation is done .
But along with safety think about taking this church towards Karna .
Therefore we not only need to save forests , trees , wild animals , but also give appropriate environment to increase in the right way .
My dear countrymen, how can we forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893
My dear countrymen, you will remember that on 29th August we will celebrate the National Sports Day.
In this context, we are going to launch Fit India Movement across our country.
Keep yourself fit and make the country fit .
All their descriptions are now told .
Keep on waiting for 29 August .
Not only 02 October is the total plastic cosmetic .
To get rid of plastic we should be with the mind of all the houses , houses , houses .
I know about this thing that dust is run in social media .
Come , let's move ahead with a new opportunity , new power , new energy .
I'm waiting for your suggestions, for your words.
Come, let us all come together to build India of the dreams of freedom fighters, let us move forward to realise the dreams of Gandhi - "Santha sad happiness.
Mann Ki Baat -LRB- Mann Ki Baat -RRB- .
O my beloved countrymen , bow down .
On 26 January 26 January the day of Ganesha Festival was celebrated with enthusiasm all of us throughout the country .
The state of India , the rule of the people of the country , the rule of the people of the country , the democracy of our democracy , all these are like a festival of our country , which makes the responsibilities of the democracy of the generations before.
But now the responsibilities of people in our country , how deep , how deep the church has to be done in our country , it does not happen so much .
To morrow 30 January is the pilgrimage of our worshipped Bapuji .
On January 30 in the morning at eleven o'clock in the morning , we pay tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country .
It should be a natural way in the society , country .
Two minutes also there is a belief of equality , consciousness , martyrs in it .
Our country is a natural ornament of army , security forces .
In the morning of this reproductive day I congratulate all their family members with various books .
In these books there are many types of Kirti Chakra , Shaurya Chakra , Param Vishisht Seva Medal , Vishisht Seva Medal etc .
If we understand their virtue , adventurous activities properly then we will also get inspiration from pride .
On 26 January 26 we were standing in the security of our soldiers in Kashmir while exciting glorious , excitement on one side .
It is said that all these virgins are gloriously glorified .
My young friends , you all know very well , I keep talking continuously in my mind .
January , February , March , April all the months of April are the time of examination in every family .
There is a test of two children in the house , there is a test on everyone in the house .
This is the right time to talk to students , their teachers , their teachers , because I went to some places , these tests were found to be a big problem .
Family , students , studyers are seen everybody . a big unique psychological atmosphere is seen in every house .
Seeing them I want to divide the thought that came in my mind .
I received a telephone message from creation.
Listen, what the creation says, "Sir, I want to tell you what I want to say to you, during the tests, in our house , in two houses , in our society a terrible atmosphere will be monthd .
Because of this reason students become more unsuccessful than inspiration .
Those who feel joyful are beneficial . those who feel stressed .
Therefore my goal is like a festival . tests should be considered to be festivals .
On the occasion of festival , festival the best Satta situated in us comes out .
Our society is also expressed during the festival .
Which is the best .
Festival removes the environment test .
Therefore I have told all parents that you change the environment of enthusiasm for all these three-four months .

Nobody has told the cost of cost .
Why did Venethan remember that you had come out of pressure .
Therefore , there is an important medicine to increase memory that it is relax .
Through my sweet experience I say that if we are stressed then we forget our things , but when relaxed then how many things do not imagine how much work we remember .
Therefore, A Happy Mind is a good mark-sheet for the sector.
Sometimes it seems that we can not see the test from the right point of view .
It is not a life test .
How do you live , how do you want to live , how do you want to live
Apart from the tests given by mouth book in the classroom many more tests have been done in your life , therefore the examinations are related to the guides of life .
J.
The great example of Abdul Kalan is in front of all of us .

Not available .
Someone has sent a question to me in the joy of joy . ' At this time the biggest challenge to see me in education is that education has become the center of test .
Therefore in today 's direction of electricity , I want to know your thought about its future .
There is a answer in their question but Rucha Garu also wanted to know my opinion .
Tell you , if you have a family doctor to show all your family then you will have to stay .
You see his experience , wisdom , how much profit he is .
Rucha Garu also took the post of 'Pratispartha'.
This is a big psychological war.
Many people have speciality in the life of the players that they become themselves comparatively compared to themselves .
Twenty years after asking his record , moving ahead by smitting himself every time is a unique life journey .
Because , he enjoyed the path of his support .
Friends, can you hide the time of reading peacefully two hours before going to the test in every kind of life
Before getting up at this time they could not get up at the time of decided to get up . Now they are getting up at the time of determination .
Before this the cost of test is not taken to sleep , now it is falling .
The same inner energy gives birth to that energy .
If you want to say easily , then three important stores will be seen in comparison to anyone . It is the first - you are known more than those before you .

But sitting with me asked me to write me .
Adopt what is .
Use how much capacity you have . How much work you are in , cataract time .
Once you learn to accept , special problems end there .
There is a belief of conservation , studies in the roots of the problem .
Several years ago - we know that the person is in the hospital with heart attack .
Then the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha of our India Ganesh Dada Mavankar, his son, once M. P. Purushottam Mavankar, came to see the hospital.
If we want to say that when we meet the person with unhealthy disease then we fear him with the name of disease .
I have told the conservations that sometimes we also behave like this with children .
In the days of test you will never feel that the condition of laughing for the child is simple .
By doing this , the weather changes .
I got a picture phone call.
And he spake not his name .
Why do you not listen to the matter , why do you not tell the name
That is why I started trying a lot .
I tried to find its methods , because of which my time has become very old .
How long time I tried to see the burras , how much time I used to read properly , they were obtained .
Seeing how you see it will swim towards the path of failing life .
If you are taken in tests then your life will be destroyed .
If you are not caught then the feeling of crime is not only in your mind for lifetime .
When you have to tell your children then you can not talk to see them in their eyes .
If you are also turning your roads into the lap, I have seen that some use so much talent in finding new ways to see how much they can spend for the methods of seeing their entire creativity.
The same creative , at the same time it is not necessary to see the same time on the subjects of testing .
The result of which is available with their own difficulty , therefore the self confidence of increasing self confidence is marvellous .
Your teachers , your parents anger me .
Because students say that if attention is paid on sports then the meditation of reading reduces .
Definitely the thought of Asli .
The rest of the body is also important for active parts of the body .
Give break for at least five minutes .
You know that your work is easy .
Everyone likes it or not but it is my experience .
In such a time taking deep breath is very beneficial .
There is no room for breathing deeply .
If you see the sky then go to Dabba for five minutes deep breathing and sit again to read .
Some people start reading more on waking up all night but definitely give sleep to the body as much as possible .
Your concentration increases .
Freshness increases in you .
The total capacity of your capacity increases properly .
When I participate in so many councils , sometimes my throat cries .
Once a folk song came to meet me .
If you sleep properly then you will get a lot of rest in your voice .
I don't think of my sleep, my hungry horse, my throat.
But okay , young friends , you are trying to test , I kept you in words in mind .
I think that my words will definitely give you rest .
The conservation of the conservation is the mantra of the conservation of the conservation .

Italy Christmas festival has been benefitted by two ways for the people of the country in the form of multiple festivals .
If you want to say in a way , two new techniques start .
Everyone wants to learn, learn each other from each other.
In order to encourage this thing, to strengthen mobile banking, e-payment habits, Government of India has started a "promotional scheme" for consumers and small businesses.

Immediately 30 crore people can be part of this multiplication plan .
People of my country , how to use technology in the country , how to do i . . . , how to do necessity , how to do necessity , how to do necessity , how to increase rapidly I am very happy .
In the last few days, non-business and non-business has increased from 200 to 300 percent.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to encourage it .
The big businessmen of this decision can be estimated very easily .
Those traders who celebrate digital lavadevis, they develop online payment system instead of money in their business, such traders have been given exemption from income tax.
For this, a committee under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Shri Chandrababu Naidu, has also been formed to take up various schemes.
But the rest of the governments have also started many myths in their own way , I have also seen to implement .
Someone said that the Assam Government will take a decision to provide 10 interest to those who pay the wealth tax and business license loans as digital.
If the branches of rural banks have made at least 2 digital lavadevis from January 2017 to March by 75 of their users, they have received 50,000 prize from the government.
The joyful thing is that in comparison to the last year the selling of GNFC has increased 27 percent .

We all are having many problems , but we all are fighting against water . In this fight we are happy to help all of us .
We are working as soldiers against black money , like water , etc .
But when such difficulty occurs , then nobody is suffering from so many problems .
As much as you have pain , as much as I have .
But for an excellent meditation , to conduct a high thought , to conduct a clean unconscious work , these problems , sadness , pains also the people of the country stand with courage .
These people are the true changes .
People are the blessings of God . their blessing is the blessing of God .
I express my gratitude to the people of the country for taking part in this great mission on water and black money.

Why do the rules of repeated times change
This government is for the people of this government .
On the other side , I said on the first day , 8th date . This fight is not normal .
When I decided to fight with such powers , they also find new ways to portray the government continuously .
If we choose such new solutions then we also have to take appropriate measures to face them .
For the people of my beloved country I want to tell heart best wishes for one thing .
Does that secret say
The secret is that the descriptions of Naka are coming from the people .

Its support is very easy to fight .
The third kind of Uttarkashi is in very large numbers .

500 and 1000 rupees will be discussed in detail.
Speaking to the people of the country on 8th November, I said that I will launch a great scheme to bring about change in the country.
When this decision was taken, I exhorted all of you to say that this decision was not normal, it was difficult.
I also say that this decision is important and it will take 50 days to overcome its impact, but we cannot move towards the normal situation.
The work that we have been working for 70 years cannot be made easy.
I'll fully understand your problems.
500, 1000 rupees, such a big country, such a large country, such a big currency, all of these decisions, the world is making sure that every economist is deeply analyzing it.
Our country will overcome this problem with all its kinds of efforts.
Over the country, central government, state governments and local institutions have been engaged in this work, and lakhs of bank branches, lakhs of jobs, lakhs of post offices and more than lakhs of Bangkok friends have been engaged in this work throughout the night.
They are working as a great transformational work by considering this work as a nation-service yojana.
For this reason, India is clearly reflecting the situation.

Our villages and farmers are the roots of our economy.
Farmers are looking for roads in the midst of many difficulties.
The government has also taken several important decisions to give priority to the farmers and the villages.
Small businessmen of our country are employed and economic activities are also undertaken.
Like big malls, small shops in the villages can do business for 24 hours, and we have taken a major decision to stop them in the following budget because in my opinion, when big malls are doing business for 24 hours, why should not the smaller poor shopkeepers in the villages get the same opportunity
We have taken several steps to lend them through Mudra Yojana.
Millions and crores of rupees have been given loans to small businessmen through Mudra Yojana because these small businesses are being made public in the form of crores.

Through Jan Dhan Yojana, there are nearly crores of poor households in India.
Before the 8th date, RuPay card was very low and now the poor RuPay card has been launched.
In the mobile phones, a prepaid card will also be available in the bank for spending dubbs.
It's easier you sent the WhatsApp messages.
Individuals who cannot be able to switch up today, send messages and forward.
Moreover, technology is so easy that there is no need for a big smartphone for this thing.
Corps will also be transformed through a simple small-scale phone.
I know very well that you all are participating in this great event.
But my dear young friends, I need your help in this thing.
Technologies will be available to use online facilities in your mobile phones.
Not only this, how to use technology every hour, every hour and every hour, how to download your bank app How to spend the dubs in your account
Train the way the shopkeepers can do business through technology.
For the non-building society, for the sweeping of mouths, for the process of eliminating justice in the country, for the welfare of the people and for the programme of making the people uncomfortable.
You will get the blessings of the poor once learned the RuPay card.
Within months, we will be a new modern India in the world.

Approximately thousands of people have suggested this thing.
We don't have a vision as we hope.
Moreover, some of the sportspersons have not been shown in Rio as well as the country's visit.

I would like to constitute a committee.
We have to formulate a strategy to move ahead by 2020, 2024 and 2028.
I also urge the State Governments to set up such committees.
Every state cannot do it.
Each state can select one or the other sports and prove strength.
I wish all sports-related events to be indispensable.
The role of her role in life is as much as the role of teacher .
How many of us have seen teachers who love more than their students.

In a way it is a hard penance .
How much desire about food has to leave them all .
The parents of their parents also have to give excitement from behind their children .
Nobody can play at night .
I am also ready to do this work from your generation.
To give your good wishes to our sportsmen your country is ready to work as the prime minister of your country .

I am talking about Rio Olympic . . a lover , Punjab Central University has sent a poet of Suraj University .
Although in all languages the poets of poets were probably written poets , they could be sounded .
But in this contribution I want to convey this poet sent to me .
Yawat world has been dedicated to the world .
But when we came to remember the name of Abdul Kalandi then this picture of India , technology , tuberculosis , tuberculosis , tuberculosis , tuberculosis , tuberculosis , this picture of India appears in front of our eyes .
You can not take technology in one condition .
If this research is not new alternative then how water standing without flowing increases pollution and spreads dirt also becomes heavy .
If we live with the help of old technology without research , then we will go behind us in this world changing age .
Therefore in the youth scientists , technologists , technology researchers have done many programs .
In our schools, wherever these tincture labs are set up, they will not only pay for sixteen lakh rupees but also for their construction up to five lakh rupees.
On the other hand if I talk about Atal Incubation Centre then in the direction of giving a total of ten crore rupees to the government has also thought about it .
Goddess India has been smitten with many other problems .
We see many problems with daily life .
These discoverys want to encourage the Government of India by giving special archaeological archaeologists .
The real attention of Abdul Kalan is that for the treatment of research , innovation , innovation , our daily life problems technology , our problems are simple - how much our youth works in the 21st century .
It is my belief that the truth of offering us to Abdul Kalan is true .
The central government has worked without mixing the shoulders with the help of the floods related to the state governments .
As much as we are running , we do not even think about us once .
The physiotherapy medicines are not working for that patient , fighting with disease , making new medicines , scientific researches have been done , so that these diseases are cutting new problems .
Therefore it is very important to be cautious in the matter of disease .
The microbes spreading tuberculosis , malaria disease take so fast changes in our body that there is no effect of medicine .
In treatment it is called antibiotic resistance .
Therefore it is said that how to take antibiotics it is necessary to follow those rules as well .
Our government has built the comprehensive comprehensive comprehension of this antibiotic resistance .
But in the last teeth the number of mothers die because of pregnancy in the last teeth has decreased but in the pregnancy the life of eight people is not safe .
Keeping in mind these things, for the last few months, a scheme has been started by the name of Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
On the basis of this technique every month all the pregnant women are conducted free tests in the government health centres .
The doctors coming forward after folding my hearing were thousands .
But our India is easy .
Lacs of doctors should be done by this technique .
There is a discussion about this in the country and abroad .
For ages in India this thing is being pressed .
In the battleground of Kurukshetra also Lord Krishna is proposed about trees .
In the recognition of Mahabharata the discussion of this has been discussed .
It is said in Mahabharata Parvat that if someone plants any tree then it becomes the form of his child .
There is no doubt in it .
It is also beneficial for everyone in the world through their children .
Therefore the parents who want their conscious parents should plant good trees . increase them like their children .
Some days Christian I remembered the example of the girls of Pune .
It touched my heart .
In the Pune of Maharashtra in Junarpur village of Narayanpur village only the Ratu had celebrated the marriage of Sonal very sports .
It is said that how much of the marriage of Sonal marriage has come to the guests , friends , guests , guests have given Kesar mango plant to all .
I am surprised when I saw that picture in social media .
The lips of marriage are not seen in marriage . so many plants are seen .
This scene of hungrying heart is in that picture .
The scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific scientific science has come to itself .
Many people use such uses .
I remember that when I am the main minister of Gujarat then in the Ambaji temple there tourists used to come in large numbers in the month of Bhadrapa .
It is said that by giving a prasad to the visitors of the temples this plant is the prasad of the plants . You will take it carefully and take it in your house , if you increase it then you will get the blessings of the Sadamas .
Although lakhs of travellers were sent to this year lacs of plants .
Temples can also start the tradition of giving plants instead of prasad in the rainy season .
This day, to build houses in our country, to build houses, to make houses, we have to import crores of valuable sugar from abroad.
If we plant trees on our trees then the trees which give work to the house , furniture can be sold by cutting them with the permission of the government after 15-20 years .
The central government has also stopped the comparison of compassion now . Below this chatti more than 40 thousand crores of plants have been provided to the state governments for plantation .
I know that the Government of Maharashtra has started a proposal of two crore old plants on the 1st honey of July , coming to the year three crore plants .
The desert area of Rajasthan . In that state how heavy Mana Mahotsav started the old lacs of plants .
It is not a common thing to plant old lakhs of trees in Rajasthan.
The situation of Rajasthan is understood to those who know that the situation of land , sarasam is so big that how big it is .
Andhra Pradesh also decided to increase the area of forests by 50 percent by 2019.
The Ministry of Railways has taken up this work under the Green India Mission run by the Union Government.
In Gujarat also there is a great bright tradition of Nama Mahotsav.
But the tourism of South Africa is like a pilgrimage for me .
It is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi , Nelson Mandela as soon as the door of South Africa .
As soon as the sounds of violence , love , forgiveness in the world , Gandhi , Mandela appear in front of our eyes .
I went to the Phinex Centre in the context of my South Africa tourism and the place where Mahatma Gandhi lives is famous with the name of Sarvodaya.
The most friends of Nelson Mandela , Shri Ahmad Kathrada , Srilalu Chiba , Shri George Bijos , Shrironi Kasriles have got the privilege of visiting all these great personalities .
We want a good future for our children .
I had so much ruined the sculpture of the sculpture . Avid sent me a message .

Seeing that enthusiasm swinging in childhood .
They showed me photographs and made Aligarh railway station beautiful throughout the week.
The artistic paintings were put on the station .
In the plastic bottles towards the railway station this Vertical Garden has been given a new form of station .
Whenever you go to Aligarh then definitely see this station .
I am aware of this news from many railway stations in the country and local people are showcasing the identity of their area through their arts on the walls of the railway station.
Congratulations to all those working in the country, especially to all the friends of Aligarh.
O my beloved countrymen , along with rainy season the season of festivals starts in our country .
The festival of Rakshabandhan is a special festival near us .
As soon as Christian year this year also you can not give the prime minister of our country 's girls , unconscious mothers , mothers , mothers , mothers , mothers , mothers or life Jyoti Bima .
This is the right meaning of Rakshabandhan.
However, I am the first Prime Minister born in independent India.
Like Deepavali we need all festivals . You also do something good with patriotism .
You can feel that these thoughts can be heard from the top of the Red Fort .
As the Prime Minister of this country, as the chief servant of this country, as your representative, tell me those things and thoughts that you say that I should listen to the country from the Red Fort.
I got the opportunity to discover words in my mind again .
In my view, Mann Ki Baat is not a religion practice
I am enthusiasm to talk with you .
I really like to join you all in the original corner of the country through the programme of Mann Ki Baat everywhere in India.
I express my gratitude to the Akashwani for successfully spreading this Mann Ki Baat programme in the Akashwani region at 8:00 pm.
I hope that in seeing our democracy working with the status of people you will be even more active , enthusiasm .
The heat of summer is increasing daily .
In such a situation the ruins of ruins have increased the dream of coming late for a week .
Approximately all the country has stuck in the effect of acute sunshine .
The temperature keeps increasing .
Animals , birds or humans .
Every animal feels pain .
Due to the deficiency of tourism these problems become poisonous .
By cutting trees carelessly the wildlife starts swallowing .
If you want to say in a way , human jaggery has put a victim of swimming development by swimming the nature .
This time, the United States Committee has decided the theme of ero Tolerance for Illigible Wildlife Trade for the World Tourism Day.
In accordance with this tradition, I can hold a joint meeting with all the Chief Ministers of the unprecedented States, but I do not do that.
I had a departure meeting from every state and I had spent about two and a half hours to each state.
I respectfully listen to what every state has said.
Normally, such discussions will not exceed the amount of money that the central government has sanctioned like the states and the amount of money that every state has spent.
In this way, it was surprising to the central government officials that some states have made excellent efforts to deal with water, environment, illiteracy, suffering animals and to take care of afflicted people.
I have instructed them to exercise the righteousness of NITI Aayog in entering the best practices across the States.
Some states, particularly Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, have fully utilized technology.
I would like to execute the immensely successful efforts made by these states to other states through NITI Aayog in the future.
Peoples participation will be a strong foundation for addressing such problems.
We will take it along and pray for God's forgiveness five times.
Water is also the Prasad of God .
So, storage of water, consumption of water and consumption of water will also be given equal priority.
It is necessary to implement more crops per drop of water by pursuing the Microsoft Medicine Mechanism (MMSME) system, through affordable water harvesting crops.
In many states, the farmers of our captives are embracing the system of microscope water supply and many others are embracing the water supply system.
Their objective is to bring two to three hectares of land to micro-water reservoirs every year.
Our Telangana farmer brothers are trying to utilize the water of Krishna and Godavari rivers through Mission Bhagirath.

In Rajasthan and Gujarat, efforts are being made to convert them into water gods in the oldest regions.
He also launched the Pradhan Mantri Jal Swavalamban Yojana in Rajasthan.
Despite the forest area of Jharkhand, there are some places with waterfalls.
This is a matter of concern for the villagers, the poor, the oppressed, the tribes, the farmers, the tribes and the villagers.
This time, we should be happy to note that how much water can be hid from Diwali and how much water can be prevented.
Then we don't have to enjoy.
As much as the power of water is, however we are tired and how much water we pour on our mouths, we will be fresh.
Well, when we saw a big pond.
We will not save the wealth by putting a cosmetic mind.
We will increase the water resources.
Increase water .
We can bring the water back to use.
I'm pressing this thing to you.
Don't leave the next time.
We will transform the Jal Bachao Abhiyan to save water from the drops of these four months.
It's not the ministers, it's us.
It is our responsibility that media and media have explained in detail about water conservation in the past.
In the field of water conservation, they also wanted to guide the people, participate in the field of plantation and water constraints.
I also welcome the media.
Let us change our old habits.
I am sure that if you help me in this regard, then we will be able to achieve our development in that direction.
Sometimes we read, there were no coins and no mouths.
If you want salt, you can give vegetables.
The world is moving towards a non-carriage system.
We can take diabetes through electronic technology.
It will not be afraid of pockets from pockets.
There are automatic counts.
It's hard in the beginning.
But gradually, if the habit becomes habitual, this system will be easier.
Through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, we have opened accounts in almost all the families of the country.
In the coming days, this card will serve in two ways, credit and debit.
The pockets don't have to be taken out of the pocket.
I don't have to wander about dubbing.
The second work we have launched will transform the Bank on Mobile-Universal Payment Interface Banking Transactions-UPI policy.
Mobile phones will facilitate transmission of people.
If this happens, you will not be able to link the RuPay card with you.
Nearly 1.
25 lakh banking components are being provided to the youngsters.
But it's as soon as it happens, it's as good.
How's the food, man.
This will become their biggest strength and when the sportsperson knows that 125 crore people are with him, the enthusiasm will double.
If the consequences of our desired consequences come, life will not stop at all.
Let us live with self-confidence, move forward with self-confidence.
But a new issue has come forward to me and I have never thought of it.
My father.
I got an e-mail in the sight and my sight went towards it.
Gaurav Patel of Madhya Pradesh has put his presentation in front of me.
He wrote that it looks a burden on my mind.
Earlier, I wanted you to develop further.
I wish all of you that when your child brings the results of the test to the house, confess them in reality, please and rejoice.
Encourage them to achieve further development, or they have brought hundreds to hundreds, all right.
If you do anything else then it will be good even on that day
The people around me don't recognize our situation.
Those lines don't remember properly.
But the poem is likely to show my sorrow on the egg of poetry of life.
The people who have seen that the picture was shining, the blue color instead of the blue, it would have been nice and it would have been better if the songs were not attached to it.
There is no understanding of the pain that appears in the picture, but most people say that it will shine.
However, if you don't be happy to see the fruits, you can never create new constructions.
All of us are happy and helps in achieving better.
It keeps on waiting in life.
You must have heard about Santur.
Sometimes it used to be a mere music in the Kashmir Valley.
Cleanliness is the biggest weapon to prevent diseases.
Cleanliness is the biggest benefit for the poor.
The second weapon is Yoga that I say every time.
It is called yoga .
June 21 is International Day of Yoga.
Yoga provides the power to live peacefully in this world full of problems.
On 21st June, Yoga Day is not a programme.
We should inspire June 21 to transform our lives.
Once a collective environment will lead to a transformation of human life.
Look, on June 21 you'll be a partner.
Can we use 21st June to make Yoga a part of our lives
This time I will go to the programme to be held in Chandigarh.
On 21st June, I will meet the people of Chandigarh and celebrate Yoga celebrations.
On that day you will also be providing Yoga all over the world.
And Sarenah , and Sarenah ,
Thank you more.
Namaste
Now summer season .
Everyone prepares plans for summer holidays.
This is also the time of mango fruits, we will be able to taste these fruits.
Once in the afternoon we feel like taking a little time .
But this year sunshine destroyed everyone 's entertainment .
It is natural to stop the species about the heat of the sun .
Other than this , due to the occurrence of unconsciousness in the last two years , there has been an adverse effect on the places standing .
Several times due to waste, due to sand floods, water flows in reservoirs and other reservoirs have been hindered.
As a result , reservoirs can keep water less than their capacity .
To solve the problem of famine , to provide relief from water conservation , governments are trying .
But this is not one .
Citizens are making commendable efforts to meet the situation.
Now there is a consciousness in many villages.
The water experienced in the deficiency of water is known by the principle of Sicily .
He said that in the village panchayats of Hive Bazar district of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra, these villagers have suffered from water deficiency as a major and soft problem.
Anyone can see the villages that have the power to store water.
Agriculturalists in the Hive Market have solved the problem by changing the seed rate of crops.
That is, they decided to abrogate the drainage and banana.
It is very easy to hear, but it is not really easy.
How big will this be the decision
If someone has to stop his units by talking about such water use to the masters of the workers who have excessive water then how can anyone imagine the responsibilities coming .
But see the scientific scientific science of this rail brother .
He said that the waste needs to be sufficient water to produce crops, so they said that it should not be sown.
Besides this how less water is being used in fruits , cow guava .
He also followed various programmes such as sprinklers, drop-out awareness, water horticulture, water recharging.
I can tell you about a small town like Hive Bazar but there will be many more such villages.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to the residents of such villages for their good work.
Who told me that Gorwa Gram Panchayat is in the Devas district of Madhya Pradesh.
Approximately 27 crop ponds have been built.
Approximately 20 of their farm production has increased.
When the water level comes up then the quantity of water also changes.
Clean drinking water is also a cause for GDP growth.
However, we will be aware of how new methods are required to find out how many efforts are being made to meet the unconsciousness around us.
This time why should we not take the soil into the pond and dug it into the field
The field will also grow well and the strength to store water for the field will also increase.
Sometimes in the cement bags, sometimes in the empty bags of the red, the water can be hindered in the mud-filled roads.
Shri Kumar Krishna was written in MyGov and expressed a kind of compassion
We cannot fail in this work without peoples participation.
It will be a messenger to transform everybody for cleanliness and for cleanliness.
This should be repeated and discussed.
It also contributes to social institutions and voluntary institutions.
Several steps are being taken to prevent sanitation and industrial pollution of the above.
Every day, a large number of garbage will come in the river Ganga through clutches.
In order to clean such waste, the work is being done to remove waste from above places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Patna.
All local institutions have been asked to inform and clean up the garbage.
The Swachhta programme is being conducted where it is being done, from 3:00 a day to 11:00 a day.
Pollution from paperwork has almost stopped.
It is known that we are moving ahead in a better direction and there is a awareness.
Not only those who live on the banks of the Ganges.
It is very rare to have so many programmes in these villages of the country over ten days.
For the betterment of the village, for rural development and for the betterment of democracy, many works have been transformed into this occasion.
Whatever consciousness has come in the villages.
Therefore, if we strengthen the progress of the village then we will achieve the desired results.
She conveyed her condolences through the phone from 1971 to Sharmila Dharpure.
(iii) Prime Minister.
Namaskar.
I am talking to Sharmila Dharpure from Kadak.
Shirmilaji, your movement is very helpful.
Now if there is a dream for parents in every family then it will be better to read the child.
If something comes to you, go yourself and talk to the teachers.
The mechanism will reduce the depths in our education system.
In addition, technology plays an important role in education.
Some people will be coming to me on the Narendra Modi App.
I am talking to Mona Karnwal from Bijnor.
They should also have a spirit of team spirit and the quality of good heroes.
Your stress, all your suggestions, all these consequences are that NCC, NSS, India Scouts and Guides, Red Cross Chairpersons and Nehru Youth Centres have organized a meeting.
He said that this is the first time that whenever the meeting was held earlier, it was a matter of fact that such a meeting would be held in the country's independence.
Water is doing a lot of water systems.
However, if we formally organised our various systems in the collective sector, we can see the greatest benefit.
Inspired and a national perspective will increase.
I have got the benefits in my childhood.
I would also like to revive a new life in these institutions.
This time I put something in front of them.
How many blocks, how many districts can we dedicate the external defecation.
Now, I'm listening to all of you.
Please give information about these youth institutions .
Have we done something new in their work and their programmes
If you come to me on my NarendraModiApp, I'll send them to the right place.
I hope that after this meeting, they will be able to give a new momentum.
Moreover, you also want to work together with them.
Crores of rupees will be spent on these committees.
But the matter was where it was.
It's everybody's experience.
Nobody thinks it more .
Today , my dear country residents , how much joy is to keep my own poison before you in this matter .
One crore families have supplied their gas subsidy cleanly.
These crore families are not rich.
Exemption of subsidies on top is also easy.
App can be done in mobile phones.
The subsidies can be exempted by giving a Missed Call to Number No.
I salute those crore families.
This is one thing that economic scientists in our country have also thought differently.
We should move forward in this direction.
I'm going to have another thing and why do I introduce class III and class III employees
Sometimes I feel another thing and I would like to tell you that there will be no tickets in some ways in the train journeys.
Once we do such a thing, there will be unforgettable results.
Okay, these thoughts in my mind, can't they be converted into government terms.
However, these people can provide the environment that is possible.
He added, Please instruct your officials to post a good event every day.
Breaking News in every newspaper and TV channel are all bad.
Whether it is a good thing about our surroundings in this country with a population of 125 crore people.
Change this situation.
Ravi Singh expressed his anger, but he was not on me.
You must remember that our former President Dr. A.
P.
Abdul Kalam used to say - Please give me good news in the first newspaper.
These days some T . . .
If a lamp is lighted, the darkness will be removed, it will be removed.
The Government is implementing a website called enhancing telephone.
We have to come together to make any positive, to talk positive, to spread positive things.
With these days, millions of people will reach a river bank and bathe a sacred bath in the world.
In the last few days, I would like to upload many singestha Kumbh Mela photographs.
I hope the tourism institutions of the Central and State Governments will have a picture competition.
Though the Kumbh is a religious and spiritual festival, we should consider it as a social occasion.
On a major occasion like Panchayati Raj Diwas, I will definitely meet you all this evening.
My heartfelt thanks to all of you.
I am very happy to have an undesirable relationship between the thoughts of your mind and the thoughts of my mind.
Man Ki Baat , July 2019 .
As soon as Mann Ki Baat is, I am also looking forward to you.
A large number of people shared details of various texts.
People are discussing the text of science, technology, innovation, history, culture, business and life history.
Sometimes, I would like to talk about some more books.
In addition, I will talk to you about other books.
However, I am convinced that there is no time to read more books.
However, one of the benefits has been achieved, that is, if you see the details you have written, I have a lot of text details.
It seems that by the experience of this month, we need to take it forward.
Why shouldn't we put a sustainable book carner to read new books in this Narendra Modi App
You can't give us a good name to this bookcarner.
This will be an active platform for teachers and writers.
You read, write and share with all the colleagues of Mann Ki Baat.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the farmers and for promoting affordable water reservoirs instead of their traditional farming policies.
Why shouldn't those places be used for water conservation

This victory will be a historic event for the winners.
But we should not forget to participate in the quiz.
We are inspired to participate as many as possible.
My dear countrymen, you must have lost one thing.
Our Mann Ki Baat has led the Swachhta drive ahead.
All the efforts made for cleanliness are inspired by Mann Ki Baat.
This journey, which started five years ago, is reaching new milestones of Swachhta through the cooperation of all the people.
We cannot reach a visionary position in Swachhta, but it is the strength of 130 crore Indians to achieve the success of Swachhta Abhiyan from ODF to public places.
But we don't stop here.
This movement will lead to Swachhta to Beauty.
A few days ago, in the media, Shri Yogesh Saini, his team and his story will be seen.
Yogesh Saini Engineer, left his job in America and returned to the service of Mother India.
He made an effort not only to clean Delhi but to make it beautiful.
They also worked with their group and from the slaughter pools of Lothi Garden.
Through the Street Art, many areas of Delhi have been decorated with beautiful paintings.
The tradition has also enhanced the collaboration of Investment People from the Over Bridge and the beauty of the slums from the walls to the slums.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated by street paintings in the Kumbh.
We also feel this in the beauty of Swachhta Abhiyan.
This is the description of Mohammad Aslam Bhai in Shopia, Jammu and Kashmir.
He wrote that it would be better to hear the Mann Ki Baat programme.
I am very happy to say that I have played an active role in building Community Mobility Programme - Back to Village in our Jammu and Kashmir State.
In addition, online monitoring should be done on this programme.
In the nearly four and a half thousand Panchayats of the state, government officials have explained the details of government schemes and programmes to the rural people. Whether all these government services are reaching them or not
He explained how to increase the capacity of the Panchayats.
How to increase their income

At the same time, Sports Kits, MNREGA Jab Cards, SCs and ST Certificates were shared.
Financial Literacy (Economic Literacy) camps have been set up.
This festival of development of the people of Kashmir was attended by the gathering.
We have seen around us in this season that the land will look like a green clothing.
The Rakshabandhan Festival will also be a symbol of the love of Sodri brothers.
You will be happy to hear another thing during the month of Shravan and this time more than four years after the Amarnath Yatra.
More than 3 lakh pilgrims visited the sacred Amarnath cave from 1st July till now.
The number of people who participated in this visit in 60 days in 2015 is more than 28 days this time.
I will especially congratulate the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality for the success of the Amarnath Yatra.
I am aware that more than eight lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Dham from the beginning of the Chardham Yatra in Uttarakhand this time too.
For the first time since the terrible disaster in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims reached here.
My request to all of you is that you should go to those places where the beauty of the country remains during the years.
To see these beauty in our country, there will be no greater teachers than the tourism journey to understand the spirit of the people of our country.
On the other hand, there is a combination of heavy years in many places in the country.
Today worldwide Christians celebrate this festival .
These are my luxuries of everybody .
My young friends .
On one side test . on the other side T-20 cricket is the world camp match .
I know that in the evening also you are waiting for India - Australia match .
Under a few days Pakistan , Bangladesh has spent India in two straight matches with water .
We are seeing a good jump in this T20 Cricket World Cup.
Today, India is ready to play the team of Australia and these two teams are my best wishes.
In our country 65 percent youth in the population of our country we do not see any reason to stay away from the world without participating in the world .
This is not the work of happening .
We need to bring revolutionary changes in sports.
We can see this place in the country of India .
Like cricket now there is an interest in football , hockey , tennis , Kabdi .
You will know that in the coming year of Afghan Ardar-17 World Cup India will be the guests of India .
Our country has come to play twenty four teams from all over the world .
In 1951 , in 1962 Indian football had spent golden medals in Asian Gams . In 1956 Olympic Gams the hair of India remained in fourth place .
Unfortunately some decades of the past we slipped to places from there .
I don't even want to talk about our roaming in the FIFA.
On the other hand , in the youth of India I am asking to increase the taste of football in the youth of India . Leave English Premier Leg , or let India Super Leg match .
Indian youngsters are giving time to know fresh information about these matches and to see them in television.
I have to say that when this sports are increasing so much that when we get the opportunity to give the opportunity to the Afghan Ardar - 17 World Cup then we will not only fulfil our responsibility .
Or do we encourage sports using this opportunity to benefit us
The word football, football, football, football, we should create a changing environment throughout this year - in schools and art galleries, if we talk about it then India is the root of every corner of the country.
In our youth , balls wet our children with sweat while playing football .
Although we got the joy of Sicily to give guests .
Therefore , we should try to take the village of football , village , street street .
From now on, in 2017, the FIFA under-17 World Cup will fill up a kind of drive in the youth.
It is better to give the guests to this program that many basic games are formed here .
We can make every young man of our country with this game .
How can we increase the interest of this sports in the youth of India by 2017 Afghan Ardar-17 World Cup
How can the comparison of comparison to this game in the government , educational institutions , social institutions
We are watching all these places in cricket
We should also try to present these parlors to other sports departments .
I want this opportunity to recognise the capabilities of India's youth, not in the meaning of a match or a ship.
2017 Afghan Afghan Afghan-17 World Cup can be displayed by comparison to the capabilities of our energy.
By doing so, we can also broaden Indias talent.
You can send your suggestions and suggestions on FIFA Under-17 World Cup to me through the Narendra ModiApp
How should you have songs
There should be any store in Sawani .
Think about friends .
Every young man should be the messenger of FIFA Under-17 World Cup 2017.
You should participate in this program a big height .
This is a golden opportunity to build India's reputation.
You will think of going somewhere in my favorite students , holidays .
There are very few people going to foreign countries .
We should take this work even more ahead .
Do this time also .
It is said that the journey without discovery is like a bird without wings .
If you are really interested to see them , then you should also prepare the international attention to see them .
The journey plays a powerful role in improving life .
Now the journey in the youth of India is increasing in the youth of India .
In the first days like everybody goes on the way to everybody , they do not go on the way .
They want to do something new
If we see the pictures of the workers there , then how will we go there
But this coal tourism has shown the status of Western Coal Filds Limited .
Near Sawaneer village near Nagpur the Eco French tourism centres have been toured above 10,000 people till now .
If you want to see something new then this is our opportunity .
This time when you go to roam in holidays then you can also do something for cleanliness .
In scientific way this attempt is not done but work is done .
But if we want to strengthen the tourism of 125 crore people of the country then we can attract the world .
We can make a big part of the world tourism .
Otherwise we can show the opportunity of our crores of youth .
Government Gony , institutions , society , society , people do the work of conducting it together .
Come on, let's try a way in this direction.
I do not like to make some vain in the city on the days of my beloved young friends , holidays .
If you do not come to swimming then you can contact swimming in holidays .
If you do not come to the cycle then you can take the decision of cycle in holidays .
Nowadays if you want to typical on computer with only two fingers then why do not I learn typing in the right way
There are many types of experts for the development of our personality .
Why should not learn them
Now look at a thought.
In these you need a lot of clases , training , very big fees , big budget .
You look around you.
You must use your holidays for the development of your personality , to glitter your experts .
This child remembered me by photographing me , what I said .
That child told me about a good work by photographing me .

Come , let us also do the words of Mahadevi Varma .
I am telling my best wishes to remember me a special thing .
The sculpture of Mysore has brought a problem to us .
You will have heard many times my beloved brother brother B . . digital India .
Digital India meaning this is related to youths in cities , which can be seen in their world .
It is not true .
You will be happy to know that Kisan Suvidha App is available for your convenience.
You can load down your mobile phones in your mobile phones . details related to environment , environment related information will come in your hands itself .
The baton situated in it speaks to you directly with the scientists , trade specialists .
If you ask some questions then they give answer .
You will tell you .
It is believed that my brothers , brothers , sisters do down on their mobile phones .
Try once . If you want to work in it .
There is some deficiency in it , there is less information i . . you can also Fire me .
Ratu waits for rain .
But if there is no water then what happens is the matter of thinking all our countrymen .
During this time we stop flowing water from our ponds , places flowing in our area , water coming in the ponds , the way to reach there , or the construction of ill effects happening there , therefore the water stops flowing there .
In the past we can prepare the cost of water , places , places , after excavating the garbage and cleaning the garbage and reaching more water and standing .
Filling lakes . If our rivers , canals filled then after that there is no deficiency of water then we do not get much harm .
But if we stand by putting a lick of water in each of us then it is possible .
This time five lakh water pools have been determined to excavate .
Although now how much more efforts are needed in this direction .
My beloved brother , brothers , brothers and sisters . Italy Government of India has organised a heavy rail route .
Everybody should be in balance .
That is why expensive expensive expensive money remains .
Our recognition was to reduce the cost and to reduce the cost of higher crops.
According to this very mantra , we should increase in scientific ways in our agriculture .
This year, the festival will be organised throughout the world with the auspicious celebrations of Beat Diabetes.
It is estimated that in our country about six and a half crore people of diabetes are patients of diabetes .
Three percent deaths are known because of diabetes .
Two types of types of diabetes are Type . . .
Type . comes dynasty .
We all know that our lifestyle is the biggest cause of diabetes .
Physical labor has decreased .
Sweating does not take place .
We can do something in our personal life to smite diabetes from the 7th honey of April .
If you are yoga meaning yoga then do yoga .
Or do at least walk or race procedure .
If everybody is healthy in this India then my country is also healthy .
On 24th March the world is celebrated on the day of Tuberculosis .
When my smaller time the name of T . . is heard then they know that they are afraid .
It seemed as if the death was near .
But now there is no fear of tuberculosis because now everyone knows that treatment of tuberculosis is possible .
Tuberculosis i . . nearby people also recognize two neighbours .
There are 13 thousand 500 centres of microscope centres in our country . four lakh dot services are available .
This test is also done free .
You should get the test done once .
This disease ends .
It is necessary to get the right treatment , till the treatment of the disease is completely cured .
There are some main contributions in the month of April . Especially April 14 Baba Saheb Bhimbheem , Rao Ambedkar Jayanti .
He had completed the year of 125th birth anniversary .
His birthplace in Mahav, his education in London, his initiation in Nagpur, his house in Delhi, 26 in Alipur Road, his last acts in Chaitabhumi.
We are constantly trying to develop in these Panchatithas .
This year on 14th April I had the privilege of displaying his place Mahava.
Baba Saheb has inspired us to change an excellent Pauri .
By changing a good citizen on his way we can glorify him in a honourable way .
In some days the new year starts in the new year .
It is celebrated in different forms in different states.
You can hear your mobile phone.
For this only one missed call has to be done .
This service started for months now but 35 lakh people used it .
You also come to number.
It is such that I am so happy to be associated with you .
I would like to know from you what your best wishes are that we can use the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in 2017 for our benefits.
How to do this program .
The program of AIDS has given a special opportunity to do this .
They have done photographs of such magnificent places that seeing them really enjoys .
It is considered a good signal .
Whereever there is no heap of legs , love to bear feet there .
This conclusion is considered to be the special impression of India .
In comparison to the countries of the world, India is very backward in the field of tourism .
You also look like this.
I'm telling you a thing to think.
Look, you'll be happy.
In Mann Ki Baat, I am surprised to tell you again.
If you want to tell the truth , I forgot to recognize it .
I am happy to see this thing .
For the conservation of water we should take those churches with complete care .
Many other diseases in our body enter the house of our body .
You must think about this thing .
It is said that the tuberculosis has come to the tuberculosis .
It is said that he had come to T . . .
Its meaning is that this disease is such that it can also be done very quickly .
But you do not think that this work is not because of the government , doctors , medicines , therefore my inspiration to the people of the country .
Therefore , your mind also keeps moving in your mind .
I also want to meet you in this journey .
You have so much obstruction in the matter of tests of your children , it is so much obstruction .
But if we change our thoughts according to the tests , then perhaps we get rid of this movement .
I have said in Mann Ki Baat that your experiences and suggestions must not be sent through the Narendra Modi App.
Today, I would like to talk to my parents, examiners and their teachers in Mann Ki Baat.
I know that tests start in a few days .
Everybody asks how to go , how to test .
How many ways come , how much scorpions do I say .
You decide your goal for yourself .
While playing cricket many estimations were on me , how much hoped they from me .
The estimation of the estimation of the time has been named even more .
Then how important is I to recognize the result of this .
I decided my goals myself , I am able to conduct them so much good for the country .
I am constantly trying to conduct those goals .
The central goals were fulfilled slowly on my sight .
Good luck.
Make your future yourself .
It is my belief that these words of Sachin will definitely be useful for you .
Why do not we keep ourselves .
Where we reached , how far we came .
Do not stick to the number of such numbers .
Deciding a greater goal of life and journey with a dream
Therefore if you choose a huge , high dream then tests become a joyous festival .
In them there is a healthy mind in the healthy body itself .
Our daily church should be according to our dreams and resolves for 365 days.
It is a special suggestion that sleep regularly , wake up from sleep early in the morning , mind .
After taking the entry of the test centres , other things reach before the scientific time .
Do not do this .
I believe you do that .
Although in life the root cause of keeping the foundation of victory nutritious .
A strong foundation falls from regular symptoms .
They do not remain unconscious , they do the work to do in the morning in the evening , they do the work to do in the afternoon after drying the night .
Not only this , our daily routine also becomes unsuccessful .
Therefore we should not see all small sight .
Definitely, do it.
Friends .
Sometimes I saw , two kinds of water is seen in the students going to test .
Who can say this thing better than me , that is , the Chanpan Vishwanathan enjoyed the players of the world who returned to the world .
He will divide his experiences with you .
Come , let the game of these tests be learned by him .
Hello, I enjoy Vishwanathan .
How should I be ready for my tests , what is my experience now .
It has been said that these tests were like problems occurring before life .
Therefore if you are calm , eat nutritious food , then your brain can remember the right peace at the right time .
Therefore stay calm .
In the last minute you should see very important stores , more important stores , you should not remember very well again .
Vishwanathan enjoyment is really an important thing .
You will discover how much concentration he sits in the international comparison to international level .
We heard that Arjun had standing on the eyes of the bird .
If you are standing on the banks of a pond then you will see many things in the water below .
Before that when there is no cost of cost then seemed to be seen after putting stone .
If water is washed , then things of foot are also seen in it .
It takes 30 , 40 , 50 seconds but once my mind is ready to understand things .
This can be my experience , it is also useful for you .
Rajat Agarwal is a good thing .
He wrote in my app: We will be in peace with friends and family members every day for at least half an hour.
Whenever you go somewhere with parents , then wear things .
Recognizing the present situation of Ranchi Manas, there is an attempt to reach the flow of culture across the country and outside the country.
Such a priest Murari Babu had sent an important Chitka for the students .
He is also a teacher , thinker , therefore there is a confusion of both in his words .
In your test if you move ahead with peace without any stress then definitely get successful .
There is also pride of success .
As a poet, I will convey my message and congratulations, there is no rule that everybody should be thankful.
Learn to live with success also .
The Mann Ki Baat programme of our Honourable Prime Minister is valuable.
I also thank him for giving a very good message to all of us .
It is a matter of how happy to me .
So much gynaecology came to be born . It seems very good to me .
Now let me say this , start doing yoga from tomorrow morning - it will be wrong to you .
Very light results .
You must pay attention to it.
Look, you can do them.
Why does all these things do the cost of cost .
Read these information carefully . two minutes , three minutes , five minutes will go .
If the question is not understood then sometimes the question feels difficult .
Therefore tests of competition .
Do not sleep , do not work without your strength .
And I said unto all my young friends , It is the same .
At the same time, remember one thing - there is a lot of opportunities in this country.
Decid what you want to do in life , do not take it forever .
You're gonna win.
You do not forget that the mother of this world is children .
As soon as the trees and mountains you also have the right to stay here .
You have to take , unparalleled feeling , meditation .
With these symptoms you will be excited in all tests .
If you want to do then I hope to be successful in every matter .
Bless you God .
Seeing , how is a great scientist speaking
Whatever thing I take half an hour to say , that thing is said in three minutes .
This is the strength of scientific science . This is the strength of the scientific mind .
I am telling thanks to the children of the country for giving support to the children of the country .
If you are strong then fear will also be afraid .
The future of gold is waiting for you to do better .
Now, on my app, a message from the taste of Dabus - has tasted the experience of his tests.
It is said that during the tests the members of their family members keep trying to stay a social environment , this kind of exercise happens in their families also .
Sometimes there are many things that do not consider the words of Bolead inspiring us - students only inspire us.
We all read in our schools about Thomas Elva Adison, who discovered the electric bulb.
It is said that light is filled in our life as well .
The cost of victory is also hidden in the victory of victory . Shrinivas Ramajan meaning who does not know .
You will know that there is no traditional education in the past .
Raling . Hari Port Siris this day has changed the whole world .
Tests are not only one among the students , not all family , school , teachers .
But without the massage of parents , teachers the condition of camel student is not good .
Vijay Jindal had written the weight of their desires on children .
Today there is no need to say more to parents .
Please do not fall in tension of children .
If someone is talking to a friend - don't hold him.
Why do I say , friends , today national science day .

This news about a young labourer, Dilip Singh Malviya, in Bhojpura village of Sihore district of Madhya Pradesh.
He worked in Bhojpura village without his physical hard work, as a sacred work and constructed 100 milestones till now.
I convey my best wishes to Dilip Sinha Malviya.
I hear many unconscious news about our country.
This is the ability to lead us ahead.
Therefore, in Mann Ki Baat, it seems very good and collaborative to meet Dilip Singh.
On the occasion of Yoga Diwas, our country also has a similar humiliation.
Cleanliness mantra has changed every household.
So far, this discussion has not been discussed in the media.
However, I am confident that the media will reach such villages and the lighting ceremony will reach the country.
The biggest benefit of this is that the government entrepreneurs in this power supply will be happy and satisfied.
We should work on good things, good things and good work done by the common man as much as possible.
This is also a service programme.
But I mean, don't I do it
Everybody will load the Narendra Modi app on his mobile phone and hand me over.
I shall share small things in this app.
It is a matter of great pleasure to tell me many things through this app.
You should also be part of this effort in your own way and in your own way.
Tell me how I will reach 100 crore Indians without your help
Come, let us inspire the common citizens to contribute to them in the common man's language and to achieve their rights.
Can we start new start-ups, innovative and various start-ups, as an excellent opportunity for our youth among our states

On the 16th of January, I will come to you and talk about this in detail.
Your suggestions are always welcome.

Schools, hospitals, government offices, bus stands and railway stations have ramps, parkings and lifts, creative efforts to facilitate all such journals in the Brailley Lipidate - technologies, systems, arrangements - a comfortable, inclusive approach.
They should not remain dead in the files and remains.
Schemes are for the common man, for the poor.
There is no way to know or know in these days.
The government has brought about some changes.
Opening of Jan Dhan Account - Aadhar Card - with the help of this, subsidies have been directly accessed to the beneficiaries accounts through the world's largest cash transfer scheme.
I am proud to note that the Guinness Book of World Records has been ranked in the world's largest emerging Direct Benefit Transformation Programme.

On the one hand, the Aadhar Card Scheme, the opening of Jan Dhan account on the other, the release of the list of beneficiaries from the third state and central governments - the linkage of Aadhaar and accounts.
National Rural Employment Homi Yojana is being implemented in villages.
Now approximately 40 thousand crore rupees have been directly transferred to beneficiaries accounts through various schemes.
I hope that 35 to 40 schemes are being implemented directly through transformation.
It is a good coincidence to be the 125th Birth Anniversary of our Constitution, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.

In particular, the impact of the damage caused by these years in Tamil Nadu has also been affected by other states.
But now the shore of the accidents has changed.
At every level, we must work towards enhancing our capabilities.
The government, the citizens, the people and the smaller institutions have been able to enhance their capabilities with so deep scientific perspective.
After the earthquake in Nepal, I spoke to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shri Nawaz Sharif.
All SAARC countries have suggested joint drives to combat disasters.
I am very happy to hear your words.
But this time is not in one Punjab or in one Haryana.
But it is very true that you have expressed the sympathy.
It's not real.
The residue of crops is also very precious.
It will help in eating cattle and also improve our land.
This will be doubled beneficiaries on the ground.
Once there was an opportunity to interact with the banana farmers.
They told me about a good experience.
When the banana was planted, the banana barks were left.
Five fingers, ten thousands and fifteen thousand rupees per hectare were spent for the construction of such land.
My dear countrymen, I will celebrate the 3rd International Day of Disabilities all over the world.
So far, I will talk to you on your part in Mann Ki Baat.
I also talk about the Noto Helpline for participants.
Organ donation saves many precious lives.
Organisation brings a different impression.
As I have already said, I will be celebrating the Disabilities Day on 3rd December.
Today I would like to tell you about Javed Ahmed.
He will be 40-42 years old.
In 1996, terrorists attacked Javed Ahmed in Kashmir.
A little part of stomach , intestine has gone .
The back was severely wounded.
How to improve the arrangements for the disabled in the outskirts and government offices
He also bought his readings in this regard.
He took Master Degree in social service.
There is also a bit of fact in it.
A few days ago, the Government of Orissa specially honoured an ASHA programme on Independence Day.
On the other hand, Mansingh village has been continuously engaged in mosquito redressal.
Likewise, there was no malaria.
My dear young friends, I have put three e-books in the MyGov site for my young friends who are very active in the Internet and social media.
The e-book is one and the other in the health sector, for encouraging stories about a Swachh Bharat programme.
Please send it to MyGov.
Bulb budget is one.
Once again, I have said that on the full moon day, I would like to salute all the lamps on the streets and brighten the moonlight for an hour.
Because the link belongs to News.
There is a woman named Nur Jahan of Kanpur.
On seeing TV, she doesn't see much better.
However, nobody thinks what she is doing.
Using the sun rays with solar power, it works to light the poor.
He's fighting in the dark.
On the evening of January, she'll be taken to the looter.
I have heard that about 500 houses at a very high altitude will come near and take the looters.
But the whole house is light .
However, this Noor Jahan will continue to recharge the transformation of solar power throughout the day.
I also compliment the GST TV because the work that is being done in Kanpur has spread all over the country and the world.
My best wishes.
Shri Abhishek Kumar Pandey has called me from Uttar Pradesh.
I am talking to Abhishek Kumar Pandey from Gorakhpur.
I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister.
I have sent a message from Gorakhpur.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana will provide funds to the disadvantaged.
Mudra will promote encouraging hard work.
Opportunities for Mudra Production are available.
Mudra really empowers.
The Mudra Yojana is being implemented to make small traders evening.
The faster the faster the speed is to be finished.
But the beginning was very well.
42 thousand crore has been given to about 66 lakh people under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
Abhishek said himself about his enthusiasm.
There will be a lot of news to my team.
Now I have said that there is a person named Shailesh Bhonsle in 1980.
He said the Swachh Abhiyan is creating an innovative entrepreneur.
The style Bhosle had shown it .
I have said that the purpose of our Mudra Yojana is also the same.
He said that in the matter of Mata Summer of Bhopal, she has been able to get 40 thousand rupees from Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
She's doing the job of manufacturing parcels.
For this reason, she used to do a lot of money in the past and used to do very hard business.
Now, she is doing her work more well because she is dubbing a lot of hands.
She was spent more due to other reasons.
Currently, the loans provided by the bank are supplied to be more than Rs. 1000 per month.
A good business for their family is gradually increasing.
However, I want more publicity for this scheme.
As much as possible, they should help small businessmen.
We want to give them strength.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October Sardar Patels Jayanti, I would like to mention 'Ok Bharat-Shreshtha Bharat'.
In some cases, there has to be perpetual sustainability in social life.
Freedom will be strengthened by the sustainable superiority of Maharashtra, Awareness and Van.
Internal deepening is the basis of India.
I told you that all other suggestions are coming.
But I hope more suggestions will come.
I want a clear scheme.
I am told that the participants will get certificates.
Some of the big gatherings have also been announced.
You also use your creative power.
Fill life .
I am sure your suggestions will be sufficient.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is the beginning.
In order to keep the body healthy, we have done some exercise and yoga in this winter.
Therefore, we will have a good habit in a good weather.
Once again my beloved countrymen.
Jayhind.
Namaskar to all of you.
The Siris has been named Gandhi-Mandela Siris.
Congratulations to them because as soon as the Mann Ki Baat Mansu Ki Baat has started, many people have been participating in it.
I have to talk about Kerala today.
The first edition of St. Mary in Kerala-Kochi and Chittor has written to me a script.
In the shape of India, the Mother of India has sent me a picture.
I am surprising that why did they produce a picture of India with their fingerprints.
However, after reading the script, I understand how important they want to give a message.
These girls have worked only to consciously consciously to the Prime Minister.
Their aim is to transform organs into a professional and professional.
These girls have written to me in the script that you should invite people on the part of your Mann Ki Baat Mansu in Mansu.
Sudke Guruji, the 80-year-old dynasty of Maharashtra, has always been a campaign.
He said that the organ must be felicitated.
In the meanwhile, I have many messages on the phone.
Devesh of Delhi also sent me such a message .
But in this country, only 5,000 components are being achieved.
Every year, there will be a need to showcase lakhs of eyes.
We are only reaching up to 25,000.
We are giving only one place where four eyes are required.
Resurrection of roadmap can be done to donate body parts.
There are also more legislative problems.
To promote paralysis, we will set up National Organisation and Tissue Transplant Organization-NOTO.
24-hour Helpline 1800-114770 services are available.
Honey Tekteen Bhanji Tha is said.
The joy of being abandoned and its best description is in the mantra of Honey Tekteen Bhanji Tha.
We have seen all this on TV.
Today, we have celebrated the Vijaya Dashmi festival on Saturday night.
We also celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi.
For the first time, we have been holding the India Port in such a big way.
We will invite 54 African nations and social leaders.
Africa is the largest member of African countries.
If both of them meet, we will be the third of the world's population.
Human Resource Development, Capacity Building and over 25 thousand African students are studying in India.
Many of those who have studied here are now the heroes in many countries in Africa.
It is known in our strong relations.
In view of this, this meeting is very important.
This time, the Government of India, especially the Ministry of Human Resource Development, has done a good job.
Millions of students visited this exhibition.
The people of the village were seen.
People are aware of how much Mahatma Gandhi played in Africa-India relations and how much the impact of personality is in these two regions.
Thereafter, many MPs have done this thing.
He worked very carefully.
Last month, a workshop was held in Bhopal.
The Adarsh Gram Yojana was discussed in detail by the elderly, district collector, parliamentarians and central and state governments.
Unfortunately, we will hear all these things when we visit Jharkhand on the land of terrorists - bombs, storms and bloodless lands.
Several areas have been destroyed due to the Left Wing Extremism.
Officials encouraged tourism.
I congratulate Shriman Kariamunda, Members of Parliament, Gaurav.
Although the news of Nako is from Andhra .
Ruwala, he was elected Lok Sabha from Mizoram, the North-Eastern State.
He has done a good job to select Rawala Hilling village in his ideal village of Northeast.
Shri Ruwala Kazir was inaugurated on 11th March, 2018 in this village.
Congratulations to the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, who has worked towards a ideal village as well as a village of self-reliance.
My beloved brothers and sisters, how will it not be mentioned about cleanliness in this programme
This message was sent by a woman from Mumbai to Savita Rai.
This time, on Diwali, we will also convey our homes as well as our homes.
As a result of this, the campaign on Swachhta started on its own with Diwali.
You have said that what we think before the festival should be brought into the form of festival after the festival.
We should do this in every public programme.
Today, I extend my best wishes to all the media institutions in the country.
Last year, on 2nd October, I got the opportunity to participate in a meeting organized on the Swachhta Newspaper, on the occasion of Swachh Bharat Yojana.
Clean India Awards were conferred by the Institute.
I salute those who have worked for Swachh Bharat under the One Like One Mission.
We have cleaned up such countries in our country.
All these have come to light and I heartily congratulate the India TV Group that has done this wonderful programme.
He also participated in the programme in about 55,56,000 schools in Andhra and Telangana States.
Overseas States, Railway Stations, spiritual provinces, traditions and parks have also spoken about cleanliness in areas.
Now these newspapers give us the power we want to achieve the Swachh Bharat goals through these programmes.
Therefore, all the people of the country are taking this programme forward by considering what Smt. Savita Rai has suggested.
He added that the Cleanest Village in Asia is the most Swachh Village Award.
It is heartening to note that many villages in the state of Meghalaya, far away from our country, have won many awards in the field of cleanliness.
My dear countrymen, I have said that in my address from the Red Fort on August 15, there are some things that have been buried in politics.
When the poor goes to small jobs, however he comes to the recommendations, however he gets dubbed from the armed forces, however he gets dubbed and when he doesn't get jobs, the money will be lost.
I have never heard in the world how many psychologists have understood a person in an interview of one or two minutes.
I convey my best wishes to all young friends on this occasion.
In the following budget, I will also announce a vibrant scheme.
In our country, gold has become a part of the society's life.
Under this, you can deposit your gold in the banks.
Now do not keep gold in house .
Another thing is that you will have gold rings in the Saverin Gold Bond.
But now we start it .
As a result, there is no need to buy gold.
In the coming week, the country will not be able to bring forward this scheme for security.
I am very happy to say that we are also bringing gold coins and Ashoka Chakra gold coins.
Why shouldn't the country's currency be
So, in the coming week, before Dhan Teras, we will reach out to the common man and we will launch Indian gold coins of five grams and ten grams of Ashoka Chakra.
In addition, 20 grams of gold pills will also benefit the people.
I am confident that this new scheme will bring about innovative change in the direction of the economy.
But the mantra of unity must be the medium of consistent conduct of our thoughts, the rule of individualism.
There is a diversity in India .
Many categories, religions, traditions, many languages, different species and cultures.
Therefore, diversity is the mantra of unity.
Peace, harmony, unity, divine medicine for these developments.
Over the last several years, the Run for Unity has been undertaken in many places in the country on October 31.
Take the mantra of unity forward.
Now you will be in the process of Diwali and you will continue to clean up the houses.
New goods can be purchased.
The festival of Deepawali is being celebrated in one form everywhere in the country.
My best wishes to all of you on the eve of Diwali.
But in the days of Deepawali, some questions are heard.
Therefore, I am very excited about my visit to Britain.
Several years ago, the work done for women's empowerment for Bhagwan Vishwaswara democracy has to be studied in the world.
On the land of London, the Bhagwan Vishweshwar Statue will be an excellent example of the invention and centuries of India's great men to think about how far and wide.
In a country like India, we should learn languages.
I will also try to reach you in your language for 8 hours in the night.
However, there was a good relationship between us.
Last year has been completed.
Now we are entering the new year.
Once again my beloved countrymen, my best wishes.
Prime Minister's Mann Ki Baat Programme (Exposition) September 2015
My dear countrymen.
Mann Ki Baat - One year, many things.
I don't know what you have achieved by this, but I cannot tell you how much I have achieved.
The power of the people is very important in democracy.
In my life, there is a primarily idea, and I am very proud of the power of the people.
However, through Mann Ki Baat- Mansu, I have learnt, I understand, I have learnt, and I have said that we think, the maximum manpower is inadequate.
Our ancestors say that the people are part of the family.
But millions of people used to consciously send me advice.
It's a great power in itself.
These lakhs of answers have taught me a great lesson.
In fact, the information should be from the lower level to the upper level, it should continue to move from top to bottom.
Who said this story will change into Mann Ki Baat Mansu.
But it happened.
Similarly, Mann Ki Baat has transformed into a necessity to inform the society.
I urge all citizens to take into account the tourism sector in India, Incredible India and brothers, I would like to visit you and send a good photograph.
However, there has been a huge solution.
Millions of people have sent photographs from all over the country.
A philosophy of the people's power, a feeling.
Once I have spoken in Mann Ki Baat- Mansu, the poor houses will be crying, the children cry.
It is difficult for the common man of the society, the middle class and the lower middle class to discount them.
There is no place from Siachen but from Kutch but from Kameroop, Kashmir or Kanyakumari to Gani-Phone.
Fonds have been done from all places .
This is a pleasant feeling.
All the adults sent their message.
I like to hear some messages myself, it's very good.
My team has been working on them all.
But because they can't see TV, they listen to radio.
I know how important the radio is for those who do not see it.
I see another new angle, how many good things they have told - it is enough to consciously conscious of the government.
Pavan Acharya has sent a message from Alwar in Rajasthan.
Soil plants are also invaluable.
My dear countrymen, I have got the opportunity to spend two-three hours with our soldiers on the occasion of Vinayaka Chaviti.
Our Army, Navy, Air Force, Air Force, Navy to protect the territory of the country, oceans and sky.
In 1965, 50 years of war with Pakistan was completed.
In connection with this, an exhibition was organised at India Gate in Delhi.
I have seen it very well.
Fighting in Hajipur was done in Gony and Chaminda, but the sight of victory over the Yandhi and Hajipur Pass will be drowned.
History meets our heritage.
I would like to visit you and your families - if you are around Delhi, I would like to visit you for a few days.
Don't go on seeing it quickly.
I've been back in two and a half hours.
A young child asked the Prime Minister, but the child soon forgot to call his name.
For the first time since independence, there has been an hour-long discussion on the issue of cleanliness in Parliament.
I see good in it .
See that the Parliament of the country should also discuss cleanliness.
On the one hand Parliamentarians, on the other hand the people of the country are talking about cleanliness.
You know what Mahatma Gandhi would say.
Once he said that if one has to be chosen in both freedom and cleanliness, he would have to choose cleanliness, he added.
Gandhijis sanitation is more important than independence.
He said Deen Dayal ji wants to know about the martyrdom of his life.
On 2nd October, the birth anniversary of the revered Bapu Ji, Mahatma Gandhi.
5 per bbl, fifteen or 50 per bbl, which will be supplied to the Khadi leader.
This joy also gives you a little share.
When I went to Kolkata in May, the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came and met.
Chandra Bose, the son of his brother, was all set up.
Happy and happy with the family members of Subhash Babu, I got the opportunity to spend this evening.
Chandrabose and his family members were present in the arrangements and more than 50 members of the Subhash Bose family came to the Prime Minister's residence last week.
However, it is a matter of great joy that the opportunity to give the hospitality to such a great man's family would never have come to the Prime Minister's residence, which I got in October.
More than 50 members of the family of Subhash Babu are coming to different countries.
Isn't it a joyous moment
Is it safe, the precious authority I have received
In the meanwhile, I have visited Kashi.
I met many people.
One was a student of Kshitij Pandey.
He is studying in the Central University of Banaras Hindu University.
But in such a young age, I have seen physics related issues.
He said that there is microscopic knowledge but I have seen his belief and taste.
I hope that all the children of the country are interested in scientific matters.
Sometimes it also enjoys such things.
Sometimes our astronauts are half an hour.
But I appreciate your feelings.
Thank you for your suggestion.
It's been smooth for a month now.
You know, Mann Ki Baat has been a year for the programme.
You know how much Subhash Babu used radio.
He congratulated Azad Hind Radio with Weekly News Bulletin.
He used to conduct radio in English, Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Malaysia, Pasto and Urdu all languages.
I am also a year to talk to the sky in the sky.
My Mann Ki Baat, the words in my mind have become meaningful in your mind.
I'm the only one, but those days will be yours.
Your suggestions should be given.
Your suggestions will also benefit the government.
Deduction will roll out.
Mann Ki Baat , August 2015 .
On the second time to tell things in my mind the opportunity to come between you .
In the southern direction people are immersed in Omsambara and celebrate the sacred Raksha Bandhan festival throughout the country .
Government of India has entered many new techniques for the social Bhadrata of common people .
11 crore families have reached this scheme since the beginning of my obesity information scheme.
I convey my best wishes to all mothers and sisters on the auspicious Raksha Bandhan Day.
Today, I am talking to you that the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has been done in a big way over a year ago.
The chances of youth have also been found . In one year Bangkoking Rang , economy , lice .
Don't open and stop accounts.
We have been able to get diabetes from the bank.
These banks are you, you don't leave them now.
I have brought them to you and now it is your duty to buy them.
All our bank accounts should be alive.
I'm sure you're gonna buy it.
The incidents and violent incidents of Gujarat have confronted the entire country.
Anything happens in the area of Gandhiji and Sardar Patel will be afflicted and painful whole country.
But in a short span of time, the elders of Gujarat, my brothers and sisters, and all the citizens of Gujarat have changed the situation.
He has played an important role in addressing the situation.
Peace, harmony and harmony are the best way.
Their words, their speaking methods, the generosity in the Sufi tradition, the harmony in it, contains the luxury of music.
I feel all this while staying in the middle of them.
I hope that the real nature of the world has to be explained to the whole world in a better way.
I am aware that the love and generosity of the Sufi tradition will bring this message to far-flung areas.
I also tell them that even when we follow any religion, we need to understand the Sufi tradition.
I will get another opportunity soon and I am fortunate to have this invitation.
Buddhists from many countries around the world will visit Buddhagaya in India.
I have been invited to participate in it and I am glad to invite them to me in the presence of Buddha Gaya.
Pandit Nehru, the whole of our country, went to Buddhagaya.
I have already mentioned this in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
We issued an Ordinance on landslide.
The Ordinance will be terminated on 31st August, 2019.
But there was a depth in it .
Therefore, on 15th August, I said that not just the Department of Agriculture, but now it will be the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare - we have taken this decision very fast.
You don't have to be afraid of fear.
When the war was proposed in 1965, it was common to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
The mantra 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan' is also an extraordinary mantra.
It is agreed to recall the valour of Indias trinity medal and its pride.
Such historic events always inspire us.
Last week, I got an opportunity to meet the Sufi community - a pleasant opportunity.
I have got the opportunity to interact with eminent scientists of the country for hours.
How to connect the workshop to the field level
It has to be taken forward as an opportunity.
I have said in the following minds that there is a need for students to move forward towards science and there is a lot of opportunities after this meeting.
Mainly tell my young friends one thing.
Everybody is running . in the lower level they can also become the reason of water .
The decision to provide relief to small jobs from the Interviews will now be almost implemented.
This is the first time that the meeting was held in other countries outside the US.
Till now, about 50,000 pregnant and 13 lakh children die every year in our country at the time of delivery or at the time of delivery.
We have got rid of polio - tetanus and infant mortality.
There are reports about dengue in the middle.
We should not die so simple.
How precious life is .
Not paying attention to drinking water and sanitation due to these deaths, it is not possible.
Free Dengue Assessment Examinations are available in 514 Centres across the country.
Now we do not have the opportunity to die for the country, but we have got the privilege of living for the country.
Both of these brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
Sometimes, due to lack of understanding, we do wrong to our youth.
I believe that this is centuries.
My experience is different from the youth.
Sometimes talking to the youth, there is a chance to learn a lot from them.
It is said that 'Sande on Cycle' is a vibrant work.
Something is that we are singing a cycle day a week.
Manki Bath , June 2019 .
My beloved countrymen , bow down .
Sometimes we only inspire ourselves .
In the middle of this time you can imagine how I spent time .
On Sunday , last Sunday at 11 o'clock I felt as if I had lost something .
Surely it feels .
Perhaps this is not an unparalleled program .
In this program there was a life , feeling its own , mind was luxury , heart was luxury , therefore this program came to this program was very difficult for me .
But this Sunday has been very waiting .
There have been a lot of messages in the last few months and people are also missing Mann Ki Baat.
It will be very good for me when I read them , when I listen .
Why did I do the journey of Kedarnath in How many acquaintances , so many people asked your question .
Your curiosity can be done .
I also feel that those feelings will be divided with you .
But if they talk then the form of Mann Ki Baat changes.
In how many acquaintances , in the confluence of Jaypjayal , even before the end of Poling I am Baaldera .
Many people have discovered the meaning of Rajiki in it .
It's my luck, I'm a chance to spend with me.
Everything can be said now that the opportunity to fill the cave in Kedar valley due to the small braveness of Mann Ki Baat came in the line of ' Mann Ki Baat ' .
I also try to fulfil your curiosity one day .
When I do not say , but definitely do .
Because you have that right on me.
In the matter of Kedar how people were supposed to be supposed to be careful about some positive things , many times in your words .
Sometimes working for my thoughts also keep your words .
People , the problems faced for the country , society , challenges , challenges are also told in my sight .
If someone is writing about cleanliness , then while expressing his wrath towards pollution they also try to clean their wrath .
That is , how the results of a kind of problems are seen in your words in the society .
The country of Mann Ki Baat is like the glass of the society.
It is known by this that there is no deficiency of internal energy , strength , talent in the country .
There is a need to coordinate these strengths and talents and provide an opportunity to carry out.
One more thing to know from this Mann Ki Baat is that all 130 crore people want to participate actively and efficiently in the development of the country.
When I analyze such things, you can imagine how much joy my mind gets.
Actually I didn't come, you brought me, sat down. You gave me the opportunity to talk again.
With this feeling, we will take the tradition of Mann Ki Baat forward.
There is an attraction in the mind of all the people .
Therefore the country has invited how many people for the protection of democracy besides its own self-confidence .
Perhaps in any country of the world, the people of the world have not only waited for democracy but have seen such a number of people in 77 (307).
Democracy has taken place in our country today and everybody from the wealthy to the poor participated in this festival with happiness and decided to decide the future of our country.
When something is with us, we underestimate it, we also neglect the effects of it.
We can see this number ordinary but if we see the world, we can say that if we leave China, more than any country in the rest of the world's population is now voting.
How many people were put in the council in 2019 , that number is more than the total population of America , approximately double .
The total number of Ooty in India is more than the population of Europe .
It introduces the vastness of our democracy.
In the history of 2019 the number of members of the world is now the biggest democracy of the world .
In such a way you can imagine how big level human power , arrangements are needed to celebrate so many times .
It is possible only if lacs of teachers , rulers , workers , workers are suffering at night .
Nearly three lakh Paramilitary Groups of Defence Officers were responsible for ensuring this great mandate of democracy and 20 lakh police personnel from different states have also worked hard.
As a result of their hard industry this time Ooting has been done more than this time .
You can imagine about 10 lakh Polling Stations across the country, over 40 lakh EVM machines, over 17 lakh VVPAT machines, how big you can imagine.
It has been done that even one Ooty does not come to use its Ooty .
A Polling Station has been set up for only one woman Oter in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
If you have to travel for two days to reach there then you will be surprised .
But this is the pride of democracy .
Polling center of the highest place in the world is located in India .
This is located at a height of 15,000 feet in the Lahaul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
Not only this , there is also another pride of this pride .
Perhaps for the first time in history women also participate in Ooting with enthusiasm like men .
The quantity of women , men polio is approximately equal .
Although the reality of enthusiasm is that today 78 -LRB- seventy eight -RRB- women are employees in parlor today .
My dear countrymen, you must have heard many times saying that I am not a book.
In welcome - culture we pray to give books instead of flowers .
Approximately many places such books are being given .
In the meanwhile, he gave me a book "Prem Chand Ki Lock Love Kahania".
It liked me well .
If you do not get long time , while staying in labor I got the opportunity to read some stories again .
Their stories reflect the mindset of the whole of India.
When they read the story of NASHA, my eyes turned towards the economic inequalities of the society.
When I was young then I remembered how many nights were spent in this matter .
We know that the son of Jamindar, Ishwari, the Veer of the poor family, if not careful, we know that when the effect of bad culture falls.
The second legend Idghah, the heart of a child, the love of his brother, and his maturity in the younger age.
Taking from the Hamid Sanctuary of 4 . years it is said to be the pride of human heart .
The last lines of this story are not so emotional, the younger Hamid plays the old Hamid Part - old Amina and Amina have become a small sin.
Likewise, Push Ki Rat is a miraculous story.
In this story a poor painting is seen .
If his fruit is destroyed then Haldu Ratu has no need to sleep at night like a cotton in winters .
Actually these stories are old for a century , today it seems appropriate to be sufficient .
After reading these I felt a special experience .
If you talk about reading , in some media I read about Aksha Library of Kerala .
If this library is a village of dense forests -LRB- Idukki -RRB- then you will not be surprised .
The primary school there was P . .
K.
Both of these were polluted unparalleled for this library .
Once the buildings of books have to be taken by deceived on the shoulders .
Today this library is seen everybody along with the tribal children .
Vaanche Gujarat (Chudu Gujarat) is a successful experiment in Gujarat.
In lakhs of numbers all the age groups participate in this park .
Definitely write about the book reading in the Narendra Modi App and all the sources in Mann Ki Baat can know about it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the people of our country will think about the future challenges besides the present.
I have seen your descriptions in the Narendra Modi App, My Collections and many people are writing about the problem of water.
Pavan Gaurai in Belgavi, Sitanshu Mohan Parida in Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written to me about water related problems.
There is a lot of importance of water in our culture .
It has been said about the water of Apostle in Ragveda . Apostle Hishta Mayo Bhuva , Sthan Urja Dhan , Maharna Chakshas , Yojana Shiva , Tasya Bhajayati , Ushtriva Matara , Shakti , Shakti , Shakti .
Everybody is lifting up the problem of water in many places of the country .
In the water of rains falling along with the year we can hide only 8  water only that you do not surprising .
Only 8  .
The time has to be discovered for this problem .
Like all the rest of the problems , with the participation of people , with the capacity of hundred crores of people , with the help of the capacity of the country , with the help of this problem is also discovered .
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country, considering the importance of water as the most important.
By this you can take decisions fast in all the matters related to water .
I have done a new work for some years .
All the surprising villages of the country were written Uttar Pradesh .
To collect water from the villagers , to collect water from the villages , to collect every drop of rain water from every drop of rain water , to make them a collection in the village , to church with the villagers .
In this work hundreds of crores of people were distressed in the 22th honeymoon of this month participating completely with enthusiasm .
People in the villages have resolved every drop of water.
Today, I will listen to you a surpanch in Mann Ki Baat programme.
The Lupung Panchayat Sarpanch of Cuttackam Sandi Block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand has given a message to all of us, my name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas.
The people there were ready to play their role once again for water conservation .
All the chiefs of the villages , all the surprises are many luxurys for their activity .
People of the village , they feel like comparing to build their village water temple .
Before me , with the efforts of social efforts the positive results are seen .
There is no fermilla for the solution of water problem throughout the country .
Therefore, efforts are being made in different parts of the country.
Therefore the problem of water logging is stopped .
The small ponds built in the fields in Kabirdham in Rajasthan have brought about a major change.
It will be read that 20,000 women have made collective efforts to revive the Naga river in Vellu, Tamil Nadu.
I also read that in Garhwal, all women are working very much on rain water harvesting.
I believe that if such efforts are being done very much then we will also be able to make impossible .
My first hearing - how the people of the country have made cleanliness and a mass movement for water conservation.
I believe that water is the prasad of Parmeshwar.
To save one drop of water a hustle-bustle garden has been done .
Talk about the problems of water in it , talk about water conservation methods .
My request is to lead innovative campaigns for water conservation especially for the heads of various sectors.
Leave films , let not play sports , let your friends of media , let the people of social institutions , let the people of cultural institutions , let them not prophesy , let everybody take the leadership of this park in their own way .
Wake up the society , do one society , work with the society .
Look, we must see change before our eyes .
I have to share the traditional methods of water conservation.
If there is a chance of visiting the birthplace of Port Bandar , worshipped Bapu in you , there is a house behind the house of worshipped Bapu where there is a tank of 200 water storage tanks .
Therefore I always say that if someone goes to Kirti Mandir then definitely see the tank of that water .
Come , let us inspire people to conserve water conservation by making information related to water conservation .

Man Ki Baat, February 2019
If it starts from Manki Baat then mind is India .
The creator Bharatma had lost his sons for ten days .
These miracles lost their lives for the protection of 125 crore people of our country .
For sleeping peacefully the people of the country these brave sons saved us from their sleep .
Our armies are always presenting unique adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous adventurous .
The martyrs of Bagalpur in Bihar, Ratan Thakur, the father of Ram Niranjon, who also inspires all of us in such sad moments.
It is said that he also sends his second son to fight against the enemies , if necessary he also fights .
Seeing the courage of the martyrs of Jagtsinghpur of Orissa , the wife of Prasan Sahu , the wife of Minah , the whole country salutes her .
This small entertainment is this that every small child of India tells us all .
Such emotions , we will be seen in the houses of our virgin , Parakrama , Amravi .
Their families also have no minerals in it .
The martyrs of Deoria, the family of Vijay Maurya, the parents of Tilak Raj of Kangra, the martyrs of the fort, the sons of Hemraj, the six-six sons of the fort, are full of the inspiration of every family of these martyrs.
I am trying to understand the feelings exhibited by these families , to understand the feelings of these families .
The living witnesses situated in front of our eyes are an inspirational example of the future of India .
My dear countrymen , independence came and houses , all of us are waiting for the memorial of war .
I was surprised that there was no memorial of national war in India .
A memorial is a symbol of preserving the bravery of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the protection of the country .
I have decided to choose such a memorial in the country.
It is very happy to fulfil this construction at a very short time when we resolved to build a national war memorial .
To morrow , i . . February 25th honey , we deliver this national military memorial to the army of our crores .
This is a small attempt to fulfil their fulfilment .
This memorial has been organised near the heart of Delhi i . . in Delhi where India Gate , Martyrs Jyoti of Martyrs .
I believe that visiting this national military memorial is like a pilgrimage for the people of the country .
After the independence of the country the soldiers given maximum sacrifices for the country are the symbol of this national military memorial .
The shape of this memorial shows the unique courage of our martyrs .
The National Military Memorial depends on four concentric circles, in the first round, the entire journey from the birth of every soldier to the sacrifice of every soldier has been depicted.
The Jawaal of Amar Chakra is symbol of the martyrs of the martyrs .
The second circumambulation is Shaurya Chakra .
There is a dense tree in this wheel .
Seeing on the top , to know about the great martyrs of our country , to tell them thanksgiving , to discover them , it is important to display this national military memorial .
The stories of those who sacrificed their lives to keep our lives safe and develop our country are here.
For the development of the country it is not possible to say in the words of our armies , police , Para Military teams .
Last year in October, I got the opportunity to dedicate this National Military Memorial to the nation.
This national police memorial is a reflection of the thoughts of proclaiming thanksgiving thanksgiving to women comparison to us for the protection of all of us .
I hope to see all the national soldiers memorial , national police memorial .
When you go there , definitely Sher the photographs taken there in social media , so that others also get inspiration to go there .
My dear countrymen, for Mann Ki Baat, I will get the opportunity to read thousands of answers, extensions and meditations that you come here.
This time, if you read your explanations, I have come to see an interesting suggestion written by Atish Mukhopadhyay.
What is he that when the British had done Birsa Munda on the 3th March , 1900 , March , his age was only sinners .
In Man Ki Baat Birsa Munda , Jamshedji Tata both of them have been written to remember the history of Jharkhand in a way .
These two great officers not only Jharkhand but also the highest India has increased the Kirti of India .
With them Ganu Javat India is with thanksgiving to them .
It is necessary to tell about any inspiring personality of the youth , that is Mahabharata Birsa .
And the British hid him , and slept him .
Why do you know why they do such a church
He had seen this only in his small lifetime .
The light of the sun was filled in the life of the people of mosquitoes , mosquitoes .
Mahabharata had sacrificed his life in the small age of Birsa Munda .
But the ill effect is that the stories of the people of those places are not present today .
He is well aware of how important it is to make India a hub for science, technology and industry.
From the point of view of his far-flung Tata Institute of Science has been established which is now called Indian Institute of Science .
Not only this he established many world level institutions , companies , companies etc .
Jamshed Ji Tataji , Samvaswamy Swami Vivekananda had been done in a ship in America .
My dear countrymen, on February 29, the birth anniversary of the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Murji Bhai Desai.
Today only four years come .
Muraji Bhai full of natural , peaceful personality is one of the most symptoms of India .
The name of Morarji Bhai Desai was approved as the most budgeted person in the independent India Parliament.
During the difficult time of the construction of the country 's democracy , the country was run with its expert leadership .
In order to save democracy Muraji Bhai dynasty has also been drowned in fighting against emergency .
Therefore in his old age also he had to pay heavy roots .
Since then the government had also kept him in jail .
In 1977 he became the prime minister of January victory over the victory of January .
In his eleventh time only 44th kingdom was brought .
Why is it important that according to the 42nd Constitution Amendment in the Emergency Emergency, reducing the authority of the Supreme Court and other such provisions are like harming our democratic values.
In this way , in 1975 as soon as the democracy was killed in the emergency period , in future there was a definite arrangement of Morji Bhai Bhai .
The future people remember the valuable support of his beauty to keep Indian democracy grandeur .
I am dedicated to such a great leader once again .
People have shown how excitement about the Padmasambhavas this time as well as my favorite country .
This is why we are stepping towards a new India therefore we should respect those who do their work with self-confidence at the level of self-confidence .
With their difficulty people are bringing suitable changes in the life of others in different ways .
It is believed that without any name standing on the ground the task of working on the ground is done by standing on the ground . Yoga . Karmas Kaushal .

Shri Shri Shri Shivakumar Swami Swamiji is no longer a news.
Shiva Kumar Swami Swamiji had dedicated his life to the society of all his life .
Bhagwan of Basaveshwar taught us Kailas i . . by doing hard work it is understood that it is like going to the residence of Shiva .
Shivakumar Swami Swamiji walked on this very well .
He is a church .
For giving food , shelter , education , spiritual knowledge to people only he was with his life .
The rails are the most important thing for him in life .
Definitely animals , agricultural vegetation is being done by Siddhganga Math .
A poet of the priests of Kalanji had also heard that contribution .
All the lifestyle of Shri Shri Shiva Kumar Swamiji, Siddhganga Math, all the goals of the Siddhganga Math are dedicated to this poet by Dr. Kalanji .
On the second time I offer my tribute to this great Mahatma .
My favorite country people , 1950 , January 26 came to the kingdom of our country .
On that day our country has become a democracy country .
We celebrated our Republic day with pride , pride .
But I want to say this .
Seeing how many arrangements happen in India the whole world is surprising .
You must have heard the things in Gujarat.
In a beautiful place of Gir forest only one polio shoes are put for one Ooty .
With the purpose of getting the opportunity to use his Ooty for one Ooty , with the purpose of getting the opportunity to use his Ooty , how many accidents the hair of the workers go away from far off places .
This is the beauty of our Republic country .
I am giving so many accidents to keep our reproductive system strong .
I also congratulate all the workers of all the states who help in participating in so many processes , independent , independent , unsuccessfully .
The responsibility of all that we should be responsible .
It is believed that in large numbers our youth Ootters river their names , with their participation give more strength to our democracy .
On this sacred Bharatgarh of my beloved country , many great men have done some marvellous , unforgettable work for humanity .
On 23th January the Jawat India celebrated his Jayanti in a different way .
Fortunately I got the opportunity to start a museum built in the memorial of the Mahavirs who gave their participation in the freedom struggle of India .
Do you know that many rooms were closed in the Red Fort on the day of independence
Although all the rooms closed have been fulfilled so beautiful museums .
A museum for Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Ki, Indian National Army, another 1857- Eighteen Fifty Seven, India's First War of Independents, has been set up.
In every brick of the rooms situated in these museums our glorious history is filled with Taluku .
At this very place the British government had run the campaign on the sons of Mother India - Karnal Prem Sehgal, Karnal Gurubhaksh Singh Dilo, Major General Shahnawaz Khan.
While visiting the memories related to Netaji in the Kranti Mandir of Red Fort, the family members of Netaji presented me a rare cap.
Indeed it is necessary to wander again in different forms about the bravery of our officers , patriots again and again .
Last month on December 30 I went to Andaman Nicobar Island .
The creator of 75 years when Netaji had flyed Trivarnapatak , right at the same place Trivarnapatak had flyed again .
People were surprised to see the flying of Trivandrum in the Red Fort in October 2018 as there was a habit of flying national flag only for fifteen August.
Azad Hind Sarkar was done in the complete contribution of 75 years .
Subhash Babu always remembers a soldier , an efficient guard .
Several years have been desired to make the films related to Netaji .
It's my joy that we're gonna do it.
I remember the day coming to the whole of the family of Netaji 's family .
We told many pockets about Netaji mixed with us . Netaji 's tribute was glorified .
I am very happy to make an attempt to develop some places surrounded by many great officers of India .

My dear countrymen, now we are talking about Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, that too in Mann Ki Baat, so I would like to share a story related to the life of Netaji.

Due to these programs our freedom fighters also got a lot of strength .
A view museum has also been built in this Kranti temple .

Talking about Chitrakoot the best pictures of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore are worth seeing .
You will know that Gurudev Ravindranath Tagore is an architect , a musician .
But Gurudev is also a painting .
The main thing is that Gurudev Tagore has not kept any name for his most pictures .
Seeing his pictures , understanding that picture itself , understanding the message situated in that picture with his point of view .
His Chittors have also been exhibited in European countries , Russ , America .
I believe that you will definitely go to see his pictures in the Kranti temple .
My dear countrymen, the land of the saints of India.
Our saints , their thoughts , their works have given the message of harmony , equality , social authority .

He has said that if the banana tree is swimming then the layer of the layer of the layer comes back but there is nothing inside and the pussy of the tree is completed.
The birthplace of Guru Ravidas was done in Varanasi .
Sant Ravidas had tried to tell the importance of labor , other labors by his country throughout his life .
It is not necessary to make an attempt to tell the importance of trouble to the world .
The meaning of his name is - if your mind is very hearty then Sakshatu will come into the heart of God .
Sanctuary has influenced all kinds of people . Chittormaharaja , queens , queens , ueens , ueens , ueens , ueens of Mirabai .

Mann Ki Baat, November 2018
On 3rd October 2014, on the day of Vijayadashmi festival, Mann Ki Baat programme was started. We all started a journey together through Mann Ki Baat.
The journey of Mann Ki Baat is fulfilling fifty bags with this journey.
Therefore this is our Golden Jubilee Episod , that is , Italy is the golden festival of Manki Baat .
This time the phone calls coming from all of you , Uttaranchal has also been proposed to recognize this golden festival .
Anshu Kumar of Delhi, Amar Kumar, Patna to Vikas Yadav in MyGou
It is said that people ask you to be more lest technology , social media , mobile ypsy , mobile ypsy , mobile ypsy .
But why do you choose radio meditation to meet people
I tell you some story .
This is the thing in 1998 .
This is the time I work in Himachal Pradesh as an institutional member of the Bharatiya Janata Party.
The cost of the country of India is called the bomb .
I don't want to understand .
That is why it is said that if you listen to radio , then in radio the same thing has been discussed .
Since then our prime minister Atal Bihari Wajpey came forward , told that the test of the media was done on that day .
The power of radio was estimated .
It is natural to turn my sight towards the most powerful medium after I became the Prime Minister.
The feedback coming in this survey is very interesting .
How much detailed discussion has also been done about psychological .
This is an example of social vision , positive emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotionality situated in the minds of all our country .
Some people have also shared their experiences as well because of the Mann Ki Baat program that is , the feeling of cleanliness service has also increased in people .
People are coming forward for the society service . This is a change of penis .
I am very happy to change radio more favorite for people because of the Manki Baat program .
The north , online expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansive expansively .
Modi comes , goes but this country remains stable . our culture remains permanent .
All these small stories of the people of 130 crores of the country remain alive forever .
All these give new inspiration to this country , with new enthusiasm the highest peaks of this country .
My experiences also participate with water with all of you .
After that slowly this thing moves towards a change by cutting houses , social meditation , water sports .
Teaching all his households as well, sometimes those youngsters who have given the message to the Prime Minister in the phone calls.
When can any government get the power to cook not only in the country but also abroad from the small village of Haryana
Many times Man Ki Baat has also become the victim of the administration but in my mind sometimes all the people of 130 crores of the country are always there .
They are all my mind .
Manki Bat is not the word of the government , this is the word of the society .
Mann Ki Baat is an aspirational India, a reputable India.
There is a kind of spirituality in your question .
The biggest glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious glorious gloriously .
If you want to answer your question smoothly then there is nothing to be made.
Absolutely Manki Bath is a very easy work for me .
Every time people come in front of Manki Baat .
People share their thoughts in MyGou and Narendra Modi Mobile Apps and also have a toll free number 180011700.
People who photographed this number record their message with their throat .
Before the beginning of Manki Baat my attempt to read more north , more expansive expansions themselves .
I listen to many phone calls myself .
Do not fall near the Mann Ki Baat program , at the time of my journey I will read how calmly I will read the thoughts , infants .
Every moment all the people of my country are in my mind . Therefore who reads any north , the conditions of those who read north , their feelings become part of my thoughts .
This north is not only a piece of kitchen .
Actually i . . water village , person 's name etc . mouths .
I would like to thank everyone who participated in Mann Ki Baat for examples, emotions and emotions.
Without reading their northern , expansive expansive expansive expansive expansively the number of people sending northern , expansive expansive expansively in lakhs .
An attempt will also be made to bring unparalleled answers and information related departments in Mann Ki Baat.
Blessed is also told to all my colleagues of Radio , Durdarshan , rest of T . . Chhanals , social meditation .
Due to their hard work many people can reach Manki Baat .
Every Man Ki Baat program of sky is published in many languages .
Some people are also listening to the sound of the sound near the Modi throat in the province language , with the same voice Manki bat .
In the same way they are becoming Narendra Modi along with those three minutes .
All of you also want to listen to the program of Manki Baat in your language .
Everybody is also considered to be less conservation about itself , or the archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeological archaeologically .
But media has changed many things proposed in Mann Ki Baat .
Cleanliness, Road Safety, Drugs Free India, Selfie with Daughter etc. have been done by the media to move forward in a new way.
If you do not have your support then the journey of this Manki Baat was incomplete .
"Thank you very much for your phone call.
If you want to say the truth then there is no secret with me .
We do not obstruct old things in our own life , it is easy to understand anybody in front of us .
Sometimes our bird reproductive system gives the biggest obstacle to the reproductive system .
Confessing , not confessing , trying to understand something instead of responsibilities is my first priority .
I keep trying to talk with various programs or social meditations .
I keep trying to understand that they were doing , thinking .
It is very good to question the youth .
They are demonstrated in multi-tasking.
If we pay attention to our surroundings , social entertainment i . . , startups , sports , or any other kind of changes in the society .
Does the courage to question , seeing big dreams adventurously
If we bring young thoughts on the ground , then they can bring changes in the country , they are also doing this .
My dear countrymen, I do not want to talk about the state day coming to Mann Ki Baat tomorrow i.e. on November 26.
It is very special today , because we have embraced the state , today we are asking for the thirty years .
Blessed is your information .
All these Mahamahals have given us so much expansive , expansive kingdom .
These are also an example of Time Management Cool , Productive City .
This also inspires us to fulfil our responsibilities during the record .
This Constitution is the confluence of the great talents of the country and each one of them worked together to empower the people of the country and to empower the poor.
Hakulu , responsibilities have been described in our state . That is the speciality of our kingdom .
Both of these conveniences take the country forward in the life of the country .
In the year 2010, when the state of India was completed 60 years, we blew the book of the state on the elephant in Gujarat.
In youth an attempt to increase the estimation of the state , to introduce the estimation of the estimation of the estimation of the state is an attempt .
In the year 2020 we complete fifty years in the form of a democracy and in 2022 we complete our independence and completed fifty five years .
My dear countrymen, if you talk about the council of the kingdom, then it is unforgettable with the native dynasty that stands at the centre of the kingdom .
Praswamy is situated in Babasaheb Narnara . India 's democracy has not come from outside .
What is the cost of the cost of the reproductive system meaning what is the cost .
India First - this is the basic mantra of Dr . Babasaheb Ambedkar .
On the second time the worshipper Babasaheb Ambedakar was worshipped .
Guru Nanak Dev had always been associated with the category of people .
He has always seen the way of truth , karma , service , compassion , self-confidence .
In the coming year Guru Nanak Dev celebrates the 550th birth anniversary of the country . The joy of these festivals spread all over the world besides the country .
All the state governments , central governments have to celebrate this festival gloriously .
Similarly the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak festival is celebrated in all the countries of the world .
Along with this a special train is also run by connecting all the sacred places related to Guru Nanak .
When I participated in a meeting related to this, I reminded of Lakhpat Sahib Gurudwara.
Due to the earthquake of Gujarat coming in 2001 the Gurudwara also got injured heavyly .
But the state government , local people associated with this Gurudwara again stands an example of this .
The Government of India has taken a major decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that our country's travellers can easily visit the holy place of Guru Nanak in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
Come , move ahead this journey .
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
On October 31th honey we all are the beloved Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel .
Every year on that day also the youth of the country is ready to participate in ' Run for University ' running for unity .
Now the weather is also pleasant .
I would like to participate in a large number in this race for unity for all of you.
Six and a half months before independence, on January 27, 1947, the world famous International Press Time Magazine published a portrait of Sardar Patel on the journal Coverpiece.
In his Lid Street that journalist has given an India pattern .
But it is not like India 's falling .
It is a part of India divided into many parts .
Approximately 550 countries were there in the country .
The interest of the Britishers of India decreased but they wanted to go to India by pieces of pieces .
Time Magazine has also exhibited other stores of human life in his business .
In the floods in Ahmedabad in 1920, how he organised aid programme, how Bardoli had guided the Satyagraha.
After discovering one problem of Sardar Patel , seeing the impossible work of making the country convenient .
All this India bound with the Akta Sutra , seeing our India , we remind us of Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel directly .
This statue established on the Narmada river in Gujarat is twice the height of the State of Liberty in America.
This is the biggest idol of the world .
Every Indian is now proud that the biggest statue of the world is in our country .
Not only this , the Sardar Patel surrounded by the earth is now increasing the beauty of the sky .
It is natural to see this statue of every Indian .
It is my belief that people from every corner of India consider this idol place as a very favorite museum.
My beloved brothers , all our countrymen have celebrated ' Infantry Day ' .
I bow down to all the participants of Indian Army .
I am also selecting the families of our soldiers for their adventure .
But you know why all our countrymen celebrate this ' Infantry Day ' .
On this very day our Indian soldiers saved Kashmir Valley from the rocks of Kashmir .
For this historical incident also there is a direct relation with Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel .
I read the old Interview -LRB- language -RRB- of a great Indian army of Sammanekshaw once .
In this conference, Field Marshal Sammanekshaw remembered the day when he was a Colonel.
At that time in October 1947 soldiers started fighting in Kashmir .
In one conclusion of sending the army of Kashmir the Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had reminded the Fild Marshal Sammanekshaw of the Sirdar Palace of the Sirdar Palace of the Sirdar Palace of Kashmir .
People of my favorite country , sports do not like anybody .
Sport , strength , efficiency , capacity - all these are important .
These are the stones of a sportsman .
These four qualities are so important for the construction of any country .
Those countries which have all these properties in the youth of the country , not only in economic , science , science , technology but also in the sports of the country .
Italy I had done two museums .
First of all, in the ASEAN Para Games 2018, we got the opportunity to meet Para athletes.
In these sports, our para athletes created by recording India with 72 medals have enhanced the pride of India.
These talented para athletes have got the privilege to meet themselves.
Similarly, there was an opportunity to meet the winners of Summer Youth Olympics 2018 in Argentina.
You will be happy to know that in the Youth Olympics 2018, our youth showcased their talent more than ever.
In these competitions, our country has won three other medals in the Mix event with thirteen medals.
This time in Asia also our country will be remembered for all of you .
See how many times in a few minutes I have used things like this , more important than this .
India is not only in sports but also in the way we have never imagined new records of India.
He worked like cleaning DTC buses and weighting in Dhabal on the roadside Dhabal in Delhi to spend his life coming out of the orphanage house.
At the same time Narayan is participating in the international competitions , India has spent golden medals .
Not only this , see the increasing capacity in India sports .
India has never achieved any Olympic medal in both Judo, Senior Level and Junior Level.
But in the European Olympics Tababi Devi has created history by administering silver medal .
Sixteen young sportsperson Tababi Devi resides in a village of Manipur .
If the father goes to the cool , then the mother was selling fish .
Many times there was no money for food in their house .
In such a situation also the courage of Tababi Devi has not decreased .
The history of neck has been created for the country .
Every young man, his sports and identity of New India.
My dear countrymen, all of you will remember that we have successfully organised the FIFA Under17 World Cup in 2017.
The world has enhanced it as the most successful tournament.
We have also created a new agreement about the number of audience in the FIFA Under17 World Cup.
More than twelve lakh visitors have been encouraged by seeing those football competitions from the stadiums of different places of the country .
This year, India got the privilege of hockey World Cup 2018 to be held in Bhubaneswar.
Hockey World Complex starts from 28 November to 16 December .
The Indian who is interesting on any kind of sports playing Indian or some other sports is definitely interesting .
There is a golden pool of India in the hockey game .
The mantra of Haki Mantra is known to the world about Major meditation .
After that Balvindar Singh Senior , Lesley Claudius , Mohammad Shahid , Dhanraj from Udham Singh decided a very big journey .
These are giving inspiration to new generations of hockey games with their industry , sports with their industry .
Seeing excitement competitions is a good opportunity for sports lovers .
You all go to Bhubaneswar and see the hockey matches , encourage our sportspersons .
Many people are coming forward to organise my beloved country , social programs , everyone stands inspiration for all the people of the country .
We can see this heritage at every place in our traditional society coming from thousands of centuries .
But in this new age , new generations have come forward to do these tasks with new enthusiasm , new hopes , new dreams .
Its name is 'self-4 society'. My portal, and the IT, electronic industry of the country should not be able to carry out the social programmes of their employees, so that they could not give them the right opportunity.
To run this program all Indians are proud to see the enthusiasm , meditations .
The journey from IT to society is not me, but from ourselves, from ourselves to ourselves.
Some children are reading , some elders are reading .
Some people pay attention to cleanliness , some rails are helping .
There is no self-confidence behind all these . only the feeling of dedication , contribution .
A young man learned the wheelchair basketball himself to help the hair of Divyas .
Mission mode activity meaning this interest is the feeling of dedication .
Definitely pride .
The feeling that I am not ours will inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I see all your suggestions for Mann Ki Baat, I have seen an interesting detail written by Shri Manish Mahabhatra from Pondicherry.
He said in Mai Gau, "Speak in Mann Ki Baat programme as an important example of life along with the Indian tribal traditions, customs and nature."
Mansh Garu , such things have been impressed to propose you before Manki Baat .
To see our glorious culture , past , this is a good opportunity to inspire us to see our glorious culture , this is the world , especially the western countries are celebrated to save environment .
Our India also faces this problem .
For its result we should see once in us that we should see our history , traditions once again .
Specially we should know the lifestyle of our tribals . It is in our tribal culture .
Our tribal brothers worship trees , trees , teeth , goddesses .
The tribals of Bhilgadh residents living in Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh region of central India worship the trees of Ravi , Arjun .
In the desert area like Rajasthan Vishnu society has seen us how to conserve environment .
Especially in the matter of conservation of trees they are ready to sacrifice their life but one tree does not let harm .
It is believed that the Mishmi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh is related to tigers.
The tigers are considered to be their own with them .
In Nagaland, tigers are also considered as protectors of the forests.
In the Briding Season of Gonds of Central India, fishing is stopped in some areas of Kethan river .
Tribals make their houses with natural substances which along with being strong also improve the environment .
In southern India a small pool residing in the solitude areas of Nilgiri Peeth is made by the small objects found locally .
It is true that my beloved brother Sodarimanu , tribal tribes believe that they want to live peacefully and comfortably in themselves but if anyone destroys their natural vegetation then they are not afraid to fight for their rights .
My dear countrymen, in Mann Ki Baat, we call upon the people and institutions who have done extraordinary work for the society.
Looking small , it has a very deep effect on those tasks .
I read about Gurubachan Singh of Punjab for some days .
The son of Guru Bachan Singh is married to work hard .
Before this marriage Gurubachan had married the parents of the married parents , but I was a Shert .
But after listening to the shirt asked a common brother Gurubachan all of you will also be surprised that is the true strength of our society .
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh has kept such an example before us .
I will read about Kallar Majra, another small village near Nabha in Punjab.
Why did this village of Kallar Majra come to the churches , where people want to burn the rest of the cereals in the field instead of burning them in the field , they are covered inside the soil , for which how much technology is necessary .
Brother Guru Bachan Singh is my best wishes .
My best wishes to all the people trying to keep the environment clean for the people of Kallar Majra .
You are moving ahead the true representatives of the Indian tradition of clean life style .
If drops , sucking then small precautions , good tasks , social works , always play an extremely important role in making the environment of social environment .
In life , in heart , in me , in thyself , in every particle of the world , establish peace everywhere .
The 11th November coming to India is special because the first World War was completed in November 111 .
The war was completed after the end of the war , when the destruction of heavy destruction , people completed a century .
First World War is an important event for India.
If we want to say properly then we have no relation with the war .
Although our soldiers were fighting with so much virtue , how big role were played , maximum sacrifices were given .
When the war came then Indian soldiers saw the world to take them away .
In rare places , in poisonous conditions our soldiers have also seen their bravery .
The objective behind all these is to restore peace.
The world saw the destruction of the world in the First World War.
According to the estimates approximately one crore soldiers , other people lost their lives .
Therefore peace is so important that the world knows .
In the past the meaning of peace has changed .
It is peace , goodwill i . . not only war .
Change in the environment from rapidity , economic development has to be changed to social judgment .
Nirvana person is a true sign of peace .
My dear countrymen , our North-Eastern states are different .
In this area the beauty of natural beauty is estimated , the people here are extremely immense .
This award, given for the best policy drive in this field, is similar to Oscar in that hole.
Not only this our Sikkim has spent this award crossing fifty naminated rulers from twenty five countries .
For this I am telling many blessings to the people of Sikkim .
My dear countrymen , October .
There are many changes in the environment also .
Along with this the weather of festivals has also come . Dhan Terracotta , Deepavali , Bhaiya Duj , Chhat . if you want to say a kind of festival month of November .
All these festivals of all the people of the country are many ruins .
I want to all of you that in these festivals not only keep your health in mind .
These festivals also give opportunity to make new decisions .
With a mission mode, I would like to make these festivals an opportunity to move forward in your life and make a strong resolve.
Your development is an important part of the country's development.
If you have so much development then the country will be so much progressive .
All of you are my luxury .
