Mann Ki Baat October 2019
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
My best wishes to all of you on Deepawali and we have been told here - Shubham Karoti Kalyan and Arogyang Dhansampadam.
At Deepjyotirnamostu in the enemy's enemies.
How beautiful is the message.
Today, Deepawali is celebrated in various countries of the world.
Not only Indians participate in this festival but governments of many countries, citizens of that country, social organisations celebrate Diwali festival with joy.
A kind of India is built there.
Friends, There is a different attraction of festival tourism in the world.
Our India is the country of festivals, there is a huge opportunity for festival tourism.
Whether it is Holi or Deepawali or Onam or Pongal or Bihu, we should try to promote all these festivals and join the people of other states and other countries in this happiness.
We have so many festivals in every state, every region and people of other countries are interested in these festivals.
Therefore, the role of Indians living outside the country is very important for the development of festival tourism in India.
My dear countrymen, I had decided on the last Mann Ki Baat, I would do something different on this occasion of Deepavali.
I had said, Let us all celebrate the Indian women's power and their success in this Deepawali, that is, I respect Laxmi of India.
Immediately after seeing, there is a lot of inspirational stories in the Syosal Media.
Worrengle's skull, Ramesh, wrote Namo App, "My mother is my power.
When my father died in 1995, my mother took charge of five sons.
Today we're five brothers in a good life.
My mother is my God.
All myself, if we look at him, he is India's Laxmi.
Ramesh ji, I bow to your mother.
In a tweet, the activation of Geetika Swami was made by Major Khushboo Kayar Laxmi of India, who was the daughter of the bus conductor and led by the Women's Force of Assam Rifles.
His daughter is Laxmi of India near poet Tiwari ji, which is her strength.
He's proud that his daughter took a very good picture, and took a very good place in the clat test.
Megha Jain says that a 92-year-old woman has been donating travellers at Gwalior Railway Station for years.
Meghazi was inspired by the humble nature and compassion of this Laxmi of India.
People shared a lot of stories like this.
You must read, inspire and share something around yourself.
I salute all these Laxmis of India.
My dear countrymen, the famous lady poet Sachi Honnamma of the 17th century, wrote a poem in Kannada in the 17th century.
This feeling is that all the Laxmis of India, whom we are talking about, maybe it was the last seventeenth century.
How beautiful the words, how beautiful the feelings and how high the ideas are in this poem of Kannada language - Peninda Permegandanu Himavantun, Peninda Bhagru Perchidanupeninda Janakrayinu Jabdedanu means Himavantun, i.e. Parvaraj, for his daughter Parvati, Rishi Bharugu, for his daughter Lakshmi and Janak became famous for his daughter Sita.
Our daughters have a strong identity and a bright future of our society through the great work of our daughters.
My dear countrymen, on 12th November, 2019, the 550th Avarbhav festival of Shri Guru Nanak Devji will be celebrated all over the world.
The impact of Guru Nanak Devji is not only in India but also in the world.
In many countries of this world, we have Sikh brothers and sisters who have completely dedicated their lives to the ideals of Guru Nanak Devji.
I can't forget my Gurudwara travel in Vanquar and Tehran.
There is a lot of talk about Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji that I can share with you but it will take a lot of time for Mann Ki Baat.
He has always given service to everyone.
Guru Nanak Dev ji believed that the service done without selflessness was invaluable.
He fought firmly against social curse like untouchability.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, his message reached far-flung places in the world.
He was one of the most travellers of his time.
He went to many places and wherever he has won the hearts of everyone through his salvation, humility and purity.
Guru Nanak Devji has travelled in many important religious places.
It is said that the famous saints of Assam and Shankardev were inspired by their ideals.
He also travelled on the holy land of Haridar.
During his visit to Bidar in Karnataka, Guru Nanak Devji had solved the problem of water there.
There is a famous place named Guru Nanak Devi, who is dedicated to Guru Nanak Jira Saheb, reminds us of him.
During a sad time, Guru Nanak ji also travelled in the north Kashmir and its surrounding places.
This has created a strong relationship between Sikh followers and Kashmir.
Guru Nanak Devji went to Tibet and he was accepted as a Guru.
He also travelled to Uzbekistan and also worshipped there.
One more sad time, he travelled widely to Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Afghanistan.
He lives in the hearts of lakhs of people, those people who have followed their teachings with full respect and reverence.
The journey was organised to celebrate the 550th Prakash Parv of Guru Nanak Devji.
There, all the Ambassadors, the Golden Temple Darshan, the Sikh heritage and culture were also obtained.
He was a great hero who united the country.
As Sardar Patel had a wonderful ability to gather people, he was able to coordinate with those who had a difference of mind.
Sardar Patel used to undertake a tiny observation and exams.
In this regard, he was the Man of Detail.
He was also skilled in organisational skills.
He was particularly transparent in planning and creating strategic skills.
When reading or listening about Sardar Saheb's methodology, it can be learned how excellent was Orplaning.
In 1921, thousands of delegates from all over the country attended the Ahmedabad session.
He ensured that no one is suffering from water.
He interacted with the farmers and urged them to build Khadi bags.
See again, that's why Khadi's sales have increased too much.
The country will always be grateful to Sardar Patel for playing a significant role in the Constitution Council.
He does the important task of ensuring our fundamental rights so that there is no possibility of discrimination on the basis of nation or community.
Friends, We all know that Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done a historic and great work to unite the regions and regions of the country as the first Swarastra minister of India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was one of the specialties that he had an eye on everything.
On one hand, his vision was focused on Hyderabad, Junagadh and other states.
In the same way Lakshadweep of the south also did not leave his goal .
In fact, when we mention the efforts of Sardar Patel, we talk about his role in some specific areas of this country.
For a small territory like Lakshadweep also he played an important role .
Immediately after getting this news, Sardar Patel took strict steps without delay.
He sent the instructions of the brothers of Mudalia , Arkat Ramswami Mudalia and Arkat Laxmanaswami Mudalia that they took the trekkers along with the trekkkers and immediately foiled the national flag there .
He was temporarily curtailed as his instructions and lost the experience of neighbouring the Lakshadweep.
After this incident, Sardar Patel told the brother-in-law of Mudalia that he should personally ensure that all assistance is available in the development of Lakshadweep.
Today Lakshadweep is contributing very important to the progress of India.
It is also an attractive tourist destination .
I hope you will visit this beautiful island and their beaches.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October 2018, the Statue of Unity built in memory of Sardar Saheb was dedicated to the entire nation and the world.
This is the world's longest human statue.
It's double the Statue of Liberty in America.
The longest statue of the world fills the heart of every Indian with pride -LRB- as an Indian the heart is filled with pride when the world thinks that the longest statue of the world is established in our country -RRB- .
Every Indian's head becomes high in self-respect.
You will be happy to know that in a year 26 lakh tourists had come to see the Statue of Unity statue .
That is, everyday about eight and a half thousand people have taken the pride of this Statue of Unity.
For Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel the faith in his heart , the faith in him has been expressed .
Now there are several attraction centres like cattle gardens, peacock gardens, wild safaris, child nutrition parks, Ekta Nursery and that is why the local economy is developing and people are also getting new employment opportunities.
Professional training is also being provided to facilitate hospitality at home or at home.
Local people have now started the farming of dragon fruits and I am confident that it will be the main way to achieve their livelihood.
Friends, For the country, for every state and for the tourism industry, this Statue of Unity can be a study.
How can we witness a place within a year become a world famous tourist destination where people from the country and abroad come .
Transportation, accommodation, the presence of guides, the environmental conservation system, everybody is developing one after another.
There has been a very big economic growth and local people are innovating services as per the requirement of tourists.
The government and its own responsibilities.
Friends , there are such Indians who will not be proud to know that a few days ago the Time Paper has established this Statue of Unity in the highest seats among the 100 best tourist spots of the world .
I hope that all of you will go out to see this Statue of Unity from your precious time but I am sure that every Indian who has come out for a tour will visit at least fifteen destinations of the country and stay there at night.
Friends, You are aware that every year since 2014, 31st October is being celebrated as National Integration Day.
This day inspires our country to maintain unity, integrity and security at any cost.
Run for Unity is being organised today.
This will include all sections of the society.
Run, mind and body are beneficial for both.
I hope that all of you will participate in the run on 31st October to keep the country's unity and body healthy.
My dear countrymen, Sardar Patel tied the country to unity.
This mantra of unity is the reform of our lives and should strive to strengthen the mantra of unity at every level, at every level in a diverse country like India.
My dear countrymen, our society has always been very active and alert to strengthen the unity and concerns of the country.
There will be many examples around us who are working for this purpose.
But sometimes their words are very quick from our memory.
Friends, I remember the month of September, 2010 when Allahabad High Court gave the opinion on the birthplace of Ram.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, our former Prime Minister Smt. Indira Devi was also killed on this day.
Today, I pay my homage to him and my dear countrymen, if every household, every village, every village, from east to west, from north to south, every corner of India, then it is cleanliness.
I would like to tell every individual, every family, every village about cleanliness because this effort of cleanliness is a collective effort of hundreds of crores of Indians.
Therefore, the benefits of this scheme are 1. 25 billion Indians.
But there is a pleasant and thrilling experience.
I've heard and I want to listen to you too.
In such a difficult situation, it is not a matter of less valour.
In such a terrible situation, our brave soldiers are not only protecting the borders of the country, they are also undertaking a Swachh Siachen campaign.
There's so cold that nothing melts.
It is an important task to separate the waste in such a situation and to manage it.
We all know that Siachen is an avalanche that is the source of rivers and pure water.
In one such place, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan means ensuring clean water for those living in the lower areas, and using river water like Nubra and Shiok.
My dear countrymen, festivals are such a festival that creates a new consciousness in our lives.
And in Deepawali, in particular, some or the other new shopping is done in every family.
I was once trying to buy local things.
If we get the things that we need, we don't need to get the funds in our villages.
If you get the fund, you don't need to go to the district.
As much as we buy local things, Gandhi will be 150 of you and you will be a great festival.
And I always urge you to buy something or the other made by our Khadi workers.
Even in this Deepawali, many have bought a lot before Deepawali, but there are many who believe that after Deepawali, things may be cheaper.
So there will be a lot of people who still have to buy.
Therefore, while conveying my best wishes to Deepawali, I urge you all to come here to buy local things.
See, can we play an important role in achieving the dreams of Mahatma Gandhi
Once again I convey my best wishes to you all on this festival of Deepawali.
We use baji as everyone in Deepavali.
But sometimes the fire takes place due to unconsciousness.
Sometimes he gets hurt.
I urge you all to be careful and celebrate the festival with great enthusiasm.
My best wishes Royal.
Thank you very much.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2018
Is there any Indian who is not proud of our armed forces, our soldiers
Yesterday, a hundred and twenty five crore Indians have celebrated the Parakram Parv.
We have recalled the incident of Surgical Strike in 2016, when our armed forces responded to the treachery in the name of proxy ware against terrorism in our country.
Our Armed Forces have organized exhibitions in different parts of the country so that the lions, especially the youth of the country can feel the strength of our country, how much we can, how much we can, how much we are capable and how our soldiers are protecting our countrymen by spoiling their lives.
The day of Parakram Parv highlighted the glorious heritage of our Armed Forces for the youth of the country.
It inspires us to ensure unity and integrity of the country.
I also participated in a function in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, the land of brave warriors.
It is sure that our armies will answer all those who want to destroy the atmosphere of peace and well-being of our country.
However, it is indebted to be respected and not in exchange for the universal powers of the country.
India is always committed and committed to maintain the peace system.
In the two-two-three wars of the 20th century, more than one lakh soldiers have sacrificed their lives for peace.
Our eyes have never fallen on the land of any other country.
This was our commitment to peace.
A few days ago, on September 23, we remembered the brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad and Jodhpur Lanser on the occasion of the centenary of the Haifa war in Israel, who freed Haifa from the attackers.
It was also an exhibition of our soldiers to protect peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest number of forces sent to the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces.
Over the decades, our brave soldiers have played an important role in the peace system of the world by wearing blue helmets.
My dear countrymen, our air force is uncomparable.
The most interested part of the masses in the Republic Day celebrations is the Fly Paste where our Air Force has a glimpse of unprecedented artefacts and energy.
On October 8, we celebrate Air Force Day.
In 1947, when Pakistani invaders started a terrible attack, the Air Force ensured that the Indian Army and the warfare reach the battlefield at the right time to protect Srinagar from the invaders.
The Air Force also responded to the enemy in the 1970 war.
Who doesn't know about the 1971 Bangladesh.
In 1999, the Air Force played a vital role in liberating Kargil from investors.
In Tiger Hill, the Air Force reinforced them by continuously bombing the enemy's footsteps.
Whether it is relief and rescue or emergency management, the entire country is grateful to the Air Force for their significant role.
Air Forces contributions in combating natural calamities such as storms, storms, floods or terrible calamities and helping the people of the country are evident.
The Air Force has also set an example to ensure the equality of Gener Equality in the country and has opened the doors of every department for the daughters of the country.
Now I am giving the opportunity to select the options of the Permanent Commission along with the Air Force Women's Short Service Commission, which I announced from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 15th August this year.
India can proudly say that not only men's strength in the Indian Armed Forces, but women's strength is also increasing day by day.
The whole country was worried about how to save him.
You must know Abhilash Tommy is a brave, brave and brave soldier of the Navy.
Abhilash is the first Indian to travel around the world without any modern technology.
For 80 days, the Golden Global Race in the South of the Indian Ocean was in the midst of a terrible maritime storm.
Even after spending such a big danger, he told me to do something like this...
I pray for the rapid health of Abhilash Tomy and hope that his courage, this valour, this determination - the power to win this fight will inspire our younger generation.
My dear countrymen, children also know the importance of the day of October 2.
This year, this day has a special significance.
We are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi for the next two years.
The ideas and thoughts of Mahatma Gandhi have reached the world today.
Like Dr. Martin Luthar King Journal or Nelson Mandeller, everybody gained strength from Gandhiji's thinking and fought a long struggle to achieve equal rights and respect for the people.
In today's Mann Ki Baat, I would like to talk to you about another great work of revered Bapu, which should be known to all the people of the country.
In 1941, Mahatma Gandhi started writing some ideas as a Constructive Programme or a Constituent Programme.
Later, when the freedom struggle was strengthened in 1991, Gandhiji made a revised copy of these thoughts.
The revered Bapuji presented his thoughts to the people of the country about the rights of the farmers, the people of the village and the workers brothers, such as cleanliness, the spread of education etc.
The revered Bapu was a gathering.
To mix with people, the specialty of Bapu's adoption of human beings, which was his own nature.
This is the valuable feature of Mahatma Gandhi's personality.
He made the countrymen aware that they are important and needed for the development of the country.
He gave this achievement the form of a universal mass movement which was his best contribution to the freedom struggle.
In the freedom struggle, the people of every section of the society dedicated themselves to Mahatma Gandhi.
Bapuji gave us an inspirational mantra which we know is Gandhiji's magic.
Gandhiji said, "I am telling you about a strategy that whenever you feel doubtful or ego cleanses your mind, remember my thoughts.
Remember the poorest and the weakest person you have seen in your life and ask your mind how much the steps you're thinking will be useful for those people.
Does it mean that millions of hungry and hungry people will achieve self-reliance
Then you'll see your doubts and the ego is circular.
My dear countrymen, Gandhiji's strategy is equally important even today.
The economic power and purchasing power of the country's growing middle class is today highlighted.
If the benefits of the poor reach the poor then my happiness will grow manifold.
Keeping this strategy of Gandhiji in mind the next day, whenever we buy something, we must keep in mind that every purchase should benefit somebody or the other countrymen and those who have sweated in the production of goods, those who have invested, those who have used their talent will benefit everybody.
This is Gandhiji's strategy, this is Gandhiji's message and I believe that your small step can bring about a big change in the lives of the poorest of the poor.
Similarly, today we can feel that we can contribute to this small task and in the economic progress of our country, in the economic empowerment of our country, in the field of poverty fighting the poor.
And I believe that this is the true patriot of today's age. This is the tribute to the revered Bapu.
Imagine the purchase of Khadi and handicrafts on a special occasion.
Two days later, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji with the revered Bapu.
As soon as the name of Shastriji is raised, there is an unlimited reverence in the minds of our people.
His generosity always fills the minds of every citizen of the country.
The specialty of Lal Bahadur Shastri was to show him very soft from outside, but at the same time he was firm.
Jai Jawan Jai Kisan was the Director of his great personality.
During the last two and a half years, he had given the mantra of reaching the summit of the success of the youth and the farmers of the country, which is the result of his selfless penance towards the nation.
Millions of people have participated in this campaign and I am also fortunate to donate Swachhta Shram with children in Ambekar School, Delhi.
I went to the school, whose foundation was laid by the revered father himself.
School children, college students, NCCs, NSS, Youth Organisations, Media Groups, Corporate World have contributed Swachhta Shram to all the elders.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the Swachhta lovers.
Let's hear a phone call, "Namskar, my name is Shaitan Singh.
I thank you for your phone.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat Mission has become a witness to a success not only in the country but also in the world.
This time, India is going to organize the worlds largest Swachhta Convention - Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention.
Officials from Ministry of Sanitation from all over the world and experts from all over the world will come and share the experiences and experiences related to transparency.
It is essential to ensure freedom, peace and justice for the afflicted, afflicted and deprived.
Inspired by his vision, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was constituted on 12th October, 1947.
In a few days, the NHRC will complete 25 years.
NHRC has not only protected human rights but also helped in increasing spiritual pride.
Our beloved leader, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had clearly stated that human rights is not a foreign idea for us.
In the symbol of our National Human Rights Commission, the ideal policy of the Vedic era is decorated with 'Sabh Bhawantu Sukhin'.
NHRC has created widespread awareness about human rights and has played a commendable role in preventing its misuse.
This visit of 25 years has created an atmosphere of hope and confidence among the people of the country.
I think it is very hopeful for a healthy society, for democratic values.
Now, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have been constituted at the national level.
All these great men inspired us, we salute them.
This year too, we are keen to organize run for unity in our villages, in our villages, in cities, in Mahanagars.
Run for Unity is the best way to remember Sardar Saheb because he has worked for the unity of the country forever.
I urge all of you that on 31st October, through the "Run for Unity", we strengthen this endeavour of binding every citizen of the society in the form of unity and that will be the best tribute to him.
My dear countrymen, I convey my heartfelt greetings to all of you for the sacred festivals of Navratri, Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi.
Thank you
Mann Ki Baat, August 2018
Today the whole country is celebrating Rakhibandhan festival.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on this holy land.
This festival of Rakhibandhan symbolizes the love and belief of brothers and sisters.
For centuries, this festival is a great example of social harmony.
There are many such incidents in the history of the country when a relationship of protection has been seen in the bonds of faith between the two states or the people of different religions.
Janmashtami a few days later.
Hathi horse Pal-ki Jai Kanhaiya Lal-ki and Gobinda-Govinda will be heard in the air.
It's a different kind of joy to celebrate this joy with the color of Krishna.
Children must have started organising Dahi-Handi in different parts of the country, especially in Maharashtra.
I am grateful to Chinmai for bringing this into account.
Friends, Apart from Rakhibandhan, Shravan Purnima Day is celebrated as Sanskrit Day.
I congratulate all those who have been involved in saving, carrying forward and delivering this great legacy to the people.
Every language has its own importance.
There is a huge treasure of knowledge in every field of life in Sanskrit language and literature.
Whether it is science or knowledge of the system, agriculture or health, physics or architecture, anchor or management, economics or environment, the mantra of fighting challenges like global warming is detailed in our minds.
You all will be happy to know that all the people of the village of Shivmoga district of Karnataka have chosen Sanskrit as a medium of interaction today.
You will be surprised to know that Sanskrit is a language that can create infinite words.
We have to weigh something weighing and use English cotton, sometimes poetry etc.
But those who are aware of the well-defined words of Sanskrit, they know how less the proper description of the subject can be done through these well-defined words of Sanskrit.
That is, if a Guru gives his disciples a letter of knowledge, then there is no such thing or wealth in the whole world that can supplement the debt of the disciple Guru.
On the occasion of Teachers Day, we always remember the great fame and the former President of India, Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan.
Teachers Day is celebrated throughout the country on his birth anniversary.
I convey my best wishes to all the teachers of the country on the upcoming Teachers Day and remember their dedication to science, education and students.
My dear countrymen, our farmer brothers and those who have laboured hard, bring rainy news to them.
A few days ago, we saw how the floods have catastrophicly causing the lives of Kerala.
In such a difficult situation, the entire country is standing near Kerala.
I convey my deep condolences to those families who have lost their loved ones in this disaster.
The losses that have been damaged may not be fulfilled any day but I would like to assure all those distressed families that 125 crore Indians are on their shoulders and shoulders.
I pray that those who have been injured in this natural calamity, take them quickly.
I am confident that the life of Kerala will soon become normal by filling the indomitable life force and courage.
The way disaster destroys peoples lives is very unfortunate, but in such a situation, we also realize the religion of humanity.
From Kutch to Kamrup and from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, every person is trying his evening so that the territories where disasters have occurred, whether it is Kerala or any district or region of India, the lives of all those places are natural.
People of all ages and people associated with all kinds of work are enhancing their help.
Everyone thinks how the sorrows and sufferings of the people of Kerala can be shared so that they can be reduced.
We all know that the soldiers of the Armed Forces are the hero of this disaster in Kerala.
They have taken all the measures to save the flooded.
Air Force, Navy or Army, B-S-F, CI-S-F, R-AF have been insisting on providing relief and relief.
I would like to specifically mention the hard work of the NDRF personnel.
The way they have worked in combating these threats is highly appreciative.
The ability of NDRF, their commitment, their ability to bring about the situation with speedy decisions has created a devotional seat in the minds of all the people of the country.
My dear countrymen, we have seen the suggestions sent to Mann Ki Baat that the most people have written about is our beloved Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Kirti from Ghaziabad, Swati Vats from Sonipat, brother Praveen from Kerala, Dr. Swapan Banaraji from West Bengal, Akhilesh Pandey from Katihar in Bihar and many others have requested me to tell me about the various aspects of the life of Atal ji in Narendra Modi Mobile App and MyGov.
On the occasion of 16th August, the people of the country and the world received the news of Atal ji's efforts.
He is a politician who sacrificed the post of Prime Minister 14 years ago and had gone far from active politics in the last ten years.
He couldn't see him specially.
The affection, reverence and condolence that everyone has shown for Atal ji is the guide of his great personality.
This country will always be grateful to Atal ji for bringing good governance into the mainstream.
Today, I would like to tell you about another example of Atal ji's great personality, that is the political culture that he has tried to bring about changes in the political culture and the efforts he has made to provide a systematic infrastructure to the political culture, it will benefit the country and the future.
India will always be grateful to Atal ji for the 9th Amendment Act, 2003.
This Amendment brings about two major changes in our politics.
The first is to limit the Ministerial Council of States to 15 of the total seats in the Legislative Assembly.
Atal ji brought about a change in this system which resulted in savings of funds and resources, efficiency and efficiency.
Atal ji was the only visionary who brought about a change in the situation and made a healthy and healthy system in politics.
Atal ji was a real patriot.
In 2001, Atal ji made the budget eleven instead of 5 in the evening.
And another Azadi, we have achieved the work of Atal ji through the creation of Indian Flag Code.
It has been applied since 2002, which has led to the tricolor evacuation of public places.
Ordinary Indians have the opportunity to lift the national flag.
In this way, he brought our beloved tricolor to the public.
You have seen how Atal ji brought about change in the polling process and strengthened the country's vision with the courageous steps taken by the people's representatives in the elections.
My dear countrymen, whenever there is talk about the Parliament today, there is talk of obstacles and hyhalla, but when good things happen, there is no discussion about it.
The Monsoon Session of Parliament ended a few days ago.
You will be happy to know that the productivity of the Lok Sabha was 118 and the Rajya Sabha was 74.
All the Parliamentarians have tried to leverage the party's interests and have been able to leverage the most. This resulted in the passage of 21 Lok Sabha and 14 Rajya Sabha bills.
This Monsoon Session of Parliament will be memorable for social justice and youth welfare.
In this session, several important bills have been passed for the development of youth and backward classes.
You all know, for decades, the OBC Commission like the SCST Commission was being set up.
To ensure the rights of the Backward Classes, the country has fulfilled the commitment of the OBC Commission this time and has given it a constitutional right.
These steps will help in achieving the objectives of social justice successfully.
In order to protect the rights of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, amended Bill has been passed in the session.
The law will further protect the interests of the people of the SC and ST groups.
At the same time, it will protect them from the atrocities of their offenders and increase their faith.
There is no civilization against the people of the country that cannot afford any injustice.
The crime offenders will be punished for a minimum of 10 years and if girls under the age of 12, they will be punished for punishing them.
A few days ago, you might have read in the newspaper, a court in Mandsore, Madhya Pradesh has only heard two of the culprits in the crime of slaughtering a girl after two months of hearing.
Earlier, a court in Katni, Madhya Pradesh was sentenced to death after hearing only five days.
A court in Rajasthan has also made such a quick decision.
The Act will play a constructive role in resolving the crime case against women and girls.
Financial progress is incomplete without social change.
In the Lok Sabha, the Triple Talaq Bill has been passed, even though it was not possible to pass this session in the Rajya Sabha, I would like to assure Muslim women, the entire country is with all its strength to provide justice to them.
When we move forward to protect the interests of the country, we can change the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived.
In the monsoon session of this year, everyone has set up a model together.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all MPs of the country.
My dear countrymen, this moment is committed to the Asian Federation organised in the vision of crores of Indians.
Every morning, in the newspapers, on television, news, on social media, an Indian sportsperson won medals.
The Asian Games are still on.
I congratulate all those who have won medals for the country.
I convey my best wishes to those who still have the competition.
Indias sportspersons, especially Shooting and Wrestling, are showing the best that our sportspersons are bringing medals in all the games we haven't done well before.
These are not just medals, it is a testimony to the courage of Indian sports and Indian sportspersons and their dreams.
In the list of medal winners for the country, the number of our daughters is positive.
Even those youngsters who have won medals are 15-16 years old.
It is also a good sign that many of the sportspersons who have won medals have emerged from the infamous villages and muffshals and have achieved this achievement with hard work.
On 29th August, we will celebrate National Sports Day, I congratulate all the sports lovers and also pay homage to the great sportsperson of Hockey Shri Dhanchand ji.
My appeal to all the citizens of the country, all of you sports and look at your fitness as a healthy India will build a rich and prosperous India.
When India is fit, India will build a bright future.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners of the Asian Games and convey my best wishes to the rest of the sportspersons.
However, the Brihadeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unforgettable combination of architecture and engineering can be seen.
Everyone was surprised to see the 11th century Rani Ki Bao in Patna, Gujarat.
The engineering laboratory is all over India.
There are many engineers born in India who have imagined unimaginable and have made examples of the engineering world.
Our great engineers have such gems in the treasury of heritage that even today surprise people.
He is Bharat Ratna Dr.
In that part of the country, he was revered and remembered by the rest of the country.
In his memory, the Engineers Day was celebrated on 15th September.
Following his footsteps, engineers of our country have made their own independent identity in the East.
In 2001, I recall the unprecedented achievements of the engineering world in the time of the terrible earthquake of Kutch in Gujarat.
He's funny looking at me, look at my house.
Kutch is called Bhunga.
My house saw three earthquakes.
He was proudly talking about this thing, and I feel that even a long time ago, engineers of our times used to build houses by justifying the local environment and conditions that made people safe.
Now, when we celebrate the Engineers Day, we have to think about the future and organize workshops at various places.
Do we have to think that we have to learn new things when we change
You have to learn
The whole world is fighting with natural calamities.
What will be the new use of stractural engineering here
What's his course
Should students be taught
I convey my best wishes to you all for this idea.
I'll talk again.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2018
He said that the thoughts of the people have been inspired.
You must have seen a team of 12 adolescents in Thailand and their coaches visited a caves.
It takes usually a few hours to go to the cave and get out of there.
But that day Bhagyadevi had another desire.
When they entered the cave, a lot of water accumulates in the mouth of the cave due to sudden heavy rains.
All efforts are being made to know where those adolescents are, how they can be brought out.
But I'm trying to see this whole thing in a different way.
The government there, the parents of the children, the people of the family, the media, the citizens of the country have shown everybody an invaluable behaviour of peace and patience.
Everyone has joined this mission with a team.
I think it's a matter of learning and self-reliance.
Mother-father wasn't sorry or mother didn't pour water.
Everyone's patience, restraint, the peaceful use of the entire society is really academic for us.
In this operation, a Thailand navy soldier had to die.
The whole world is surprised that despite such a disaster, the rescuers have worked with courage and patience in the water-borne dark cave.
This incident shows that when people join, there is a lot of amazing things.
It is necessary that we concentrate on our goals and work for them in a calm mind.
A few days ago, Neeraj, the popular poet of our country, had tried.
The characteristics of poet Neeraj were hope, trust, determination and self-confidence.
All the words of poet Neeraj can inspire all of us.
He wrote: The darkness will be removed as soon as the lightning of Hollywood burns, the darkness will be removed and I pay my homage to poet Neeraj.
The month of July and the next month is very important for the farmers and for all the youth.
Because this is the time when a pick session for colleges.
Like truth, millions of youngsters went out of school and went to college.
The exams for the month of February and March are written in the question-answer and the months of April and May are enjoyed as soon as the results, future lifestyles and career sustains.
The month of July is the month when the youngsters move on a new path to their lives, when the focus moves from Kochhan to Kat-of.
The attention of the students goes from Home to Hostel.
Students enter the umbrella of Professors from the umbrella of Parents.
I believe that my young friends are very enthusiastic and happy about the beginning of college life.
For the first time, out of the house, out of the village, out of a safe environment, we have to be a guide to ourselves.
All these youngsters left their homes and left their lives on a new path.
There is no way to study without books, but the desire to find new things will continue.
Old friends are very precious.
The youngsters who have left their homes and went out to study somewhere else, find out the place and know about the people there, the language, the culture.
I congratulate all the youngsters for starting a new chapter.
Her father's life-long waste waste and nutrition waste to the family.
I congratulate Asharam for his success in that situation.
There are so many poor families who have shown their hard work and concentration in adverse conditions that inspire all of us.
Like Prince Kumar of Delhi, whose father was a resident of DT-C or Kolkata Abhay Gupta, who had studied under the light of the footpath, the daughter of Ahmedabad, Afrien Sheikh, whose father Auto Challan, is the daughter of the school driver of Nagpur, Khushi of the school driver of Nagpur, Kartik, son of Haryana Chaukidar or Ramesh Sahu, son of a brick-wheeler of Jharkhand.
Anushka Pandey, a victim of hereditary disease called Spinal Mascular Autopsy, is born in Gurgaon, all of them have achieved the success of showing the world with their strong resolve and mind.
When we look around us, we will find such examples.
Any good event in any part of the country gives me strength and inspiration.
My dear countrymen, a news came to me a few days ago, in which it was written: Modi's dream was fulfilled by two youths.
After reading the inner news, we came to know how our youth is trying to transform the lives of the common man with the help of technology smart and creative uses.
Once in the city of San Jose, in America, I had requested the Indian youth to think about how their talents can be used for India and do something out of time.
I had requested Brain-Drain to replace Brain-Gain.
Two IT professionals from Rae Bareli, Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Vajpayee ji have taken a new effort by accepting this challenge.
Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have made a Smart Gram App using their professional skills.
This app will not only connect the people of the village to the entire world but will now get any information or news in their mobile phones.
The App provides all the telephone directory, News sections, events lists, health centres, information centres in the village.
The App is also very useful for the farmers and the FACT rate among the Kisans is working on the market to sell their produce from one side.
Santosh ji, thank you very much for your phone
Indeed, the pious journey of Pandarpur is a unique festival.
Friends, Academy of the sixty-and-a-half month, which was on 23rd July this year, this day the pilgrimage of Pandirpur took place with a glimpse.
Pandurpur is a sacred city of Kolapur district of Maharashtra.
Saints like Saint Gyaneshwar and Saint Tukaram were given a paduka palanquin to Pandarpur to dance in the name of Bitthal Lord.
Bhagwan Bitthal, who is also called Bithoba or Pandurang, devotees visited there for his darshan.
Lord Bittal protects the poor, helpless and the suffering.
The people of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Goa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana have immense faith and devotion to this god.
You people visit the Bithoba temple in Pandarpur, there is a different feeling of dignity, beauty and spiritual joy.
I urge the audience of Mann Ki Baat, if there is an opportunity, you must experience the pilgrimage of Pandarpur.
Innumerable saints like Jnaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Ramdas, Tukaram are still teaching the common man in Maharashtra.
We have the guidance of goodwill, love and brotherhood from them.
The society can fight against blind faith with reverence, we find this mantra from them.
They have shown the right path to the society at the right time and have ensured that the old evils are removed from the society and have brought compassion, equality and purity among the people.
Just like this was a great man, Lokmanya Tilak, who made a deep mark in many Indians.
We remember Tilak ji's birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was brave and self-confidence.
He had the power and intellect of the British rulers.
The British were so scared of Lokmanya Tilak that there was a complaint of treason against him three-three times in twenty years.
I am telling you about a special event about the statues he has in Lokmanya Tilak and Ahmedabad.
In October 1916, when Lokmanya Tilak ji came to Ahmedabad, think about 100 years ago, more than forty thousand people gathered to welcome him.
After that, at the Mayor of City Corporation, Vallabhbhai Patel decided to set up a memorial of His Majesty Tilak at Victoria Garden, the ueen of Britain.
Normally, the British rulers were very dissatisfied with the fact that the Collector of the country has repeatedly proposed to build a memorial called Smaru Hella.
But Sardar Saheb is Sardar Saheb, he will resign, but he will leave the memorial statue of Lokmanya Tilak.
Finally, the statue was built by Sardar Patel and invited Mahatma Gandhi to inaugurate the statue on February 28, 1929.
During the inauguration ceremony, the revered Bapu said that the Ahmedabad Purvasabha had not only received a person as a Mayor but also got a power to build a statue of Tilak.
My dear countrymen, this statue that Sardar Patel had established is a special feature of Lokmanya Tilak ji's chair and is written under this statue, "Swaraj is my birth rights".
This writing to the British started listening to God's instructions.
The first Public Ganesh Festival was inaugurated by Lokmanya Tilak.
The Ganesh Festival was traditionally rich in respect and organisation and became an effective medium for creating a spirit of social awareness, unity, equality and equality.
Now one can see Ganesh Mandap on the streets of any city.
The Ganesh festival is organized by all the families of the streets.
This is an unprecedented opportunity for our youth so that they can achieve special capabilities like organisation and leadership and develop them within themselves.
My dear countrymen, I have said last time too, today I will recall Lokmanya Tilak ji and recall you still celebrate the Ganesh Festival with great fanfare but celebrate the 'Period Bandhav' festival.
From the statue of Ganesh Ji, his decoration and worship should be environmentally friendly.
Those who dedicated their lives so that the countrymen can breathe in a free India.
I'm talking about Chandrashekhar Azad.
There are no youngsters in India who will not be inspired by listening to this poem - Sarforshi Ki Tanna of Hamre Deal May, Hay Joor Kitna Baju-e-Katil May, the lines of this poem inspired Tejis like Ashfak King Khan, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad.
Chandrashekhar Azads valour and valour for freedom inspired many youngsters.
Azad lived his life, but never before the foreign rule, the head was naked.
I am fortunate to have got the opportunity to visit Chandrashekhar Azad village Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh.
Once again I bow down to the two great sons of Bharat Mata Lokmanya Tilak ji and Chandrashekhar Azad ji.
A few days ago, India's brave daughter, Kisankanna Hima Das, won the Gold Medal at the 20th World Athletics Square in Finland.
Another daughter of the country, Ekta Bhaian, in response to my letter, emails me from Indonesia and is now preparing for the Asian Games.
The e-Mail writes unity. The athlete's life is the moment when he has been furious and I am proud to do it.
Unity, we all are proud of you.
His success is because he has made his challenges a medium of success.
In 2003, Ekta became the lower part of the body of the terrible fear in the Road Accident, but this girl did not lose courage and strengthened herself and reached her goal.
I salute Ekta Bhaian ji, Yogesh Katunia ji, Sundar Singh ji for their courage and struggle.
Go ahead, play, improve.
My dear countrymen, the past month is full of several events and events of history but sometimes due to the weather the diseases also enter the house.
I convey my best wishes to you all for the good health, for the next month and for many festivals that have been going on for centuries to inspire patriotism.
We will join Mann Ki Baat again.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, once again, I am fortunate to be with you all in this event of Mann Ki Baat.
A few days ago there was a historic cricket game in Bangalore.
You might have understood that I am talking about the test match between India and Afghanistan.
This was Afghanistan's first international test match and it was a matter of pride for all Indians that this historic match of Afghanistan was with India.
The two sides showcased excellent sportspersons.
Rasheed Khan, an Afghan opponent, played a very good role in the IPL this year, and I remember that the President of Afghanistan, Mr. Ashrafgani, tagged me in his tweet: "Afghanistan people are very proud of their hero Rashid Khan.
I also thank our Indian friends who have created a platform to showcase our sportspersons.
Afghan's best, Rashid represented him, the Prime Minister said.
He was a wealth in the world of cricket, and he enjoyed a bit - "No, I don't want to give it to anyone."
This match will be remembered to all of us.
Though it was the first match, it's normal to remember, but I'll remember this match for another thing.
The Indian team has done a job which is unnatural all over the world.
At the time of taking the Indian team, a winner team showed what he could do.
At the time of taking up the Indian team, the Afghan team invites those who play international matches for the first time and photographs together.
What can happen to sportsman spirit and sportsmanship, we can feel this thing.
The best way to find out the talent that our youngsters have integrated the sports society.
My best wishes to the two teams of India and Afghanistan.
My dear countrymen, on 21st June this fourth Yoga Day, a wonderful scene has been seen.
Whether it is the Brussels-European Parliament, the United Nations Headquarters at New York, the Japanese Navy fighter ships, people have been exercising Yoga everywhere.
For the first time in Saudi Arabia, the historic event of Yoga has been organized and I have been told that many seats have been demonstrated by women.
India and China have together practiced Yoga on the high ice peaks of Ladakh.
If people from all over the world participate in the Yoga Day celebrations with such enthusiasm, then why will it not be encouraged in India
Our warriors of the Air Force have pillared everybody by doing Yoga at a height of 15,000 feet from the earth in the middle of the sky.
There was a sighting scene. They were not sitting in the air, they were dragging in the air.
Be it schools, colleges, offices, parks, high houses or playgrounds, Yoga has been practiced everywhere.
A vision of Ahmedabad was enchanting, where about 750 dynasty brothers and sisters have made a record by doing yoga together.
I believe, today Yoga is working as a wellness, revolution.
Wellness's efforts are being made through Yoga. I hope that it will move forward.
Gradually many people will choose Yoga as part of their lives.
Thank you for your phone call.
You guys, Kabirdas jiken went to Imghar
The meaningful compassionate is the one who can understand the sorrow of others.
Whoever doesn't understand the sorrow and sorrow of others, he's ruthless.
Kabirdas ji emphasized on social coordination.
"Jugme Bairi Koi Nehi, Joe Man is cold.
Yeah, Dad, please.
At Arak Doha, Kabirdas ji says, "Whatever mercy is the religion, where iron is the sin.
His invaluable speech has been influenced even after this time. Now when we talk about Saint poet Kabirdas ji, he remembers one of his kindness.
This is the greatness of Guru and such a guru is Jagatguru Guru Nanak Dev.
Those who have shown the path of truth to millions of people, who have been inspiring the people from time to time.
The 550th edition of Guru Nanak Dev Ji will be held in 2019.
One more history is associated with Punjab.
In 2019, the horrific event of Jallianwala Bagh, which is going to complete 100 years, is an event which has shamefully embarrassed humanity.
On April 13, 1919, somebody forgot that black day, when utilising power, crossing all boundaries of integrity, firing on innocent, unarmed and innocent people.
We will always remember the eternal message that this is going to complete 100 years of sympathy but it is that violence and destruction can never solve any problem.
Peace, non-violence, sacrifice and sacrifice are always won.
My dear countrymen, Shri Raman Kumar of Rohini, Delhi wrote in the Narendra Modi Mobile App on 6th July, 2019.
Ramanji, thank you all for the first time
It is very good to see your interest in India's history.
You know, on 23rd June, Dr.
Perhaps a few people know that in 1937, Dr.
In the invitation of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore addressed the convocation of the University of Kolkata in Bengal.
This was the first example when a person was speaking in Bengal at the convocation of the University of Kolkata during the British rule.
From 1947 to 1950, Dr.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee was the first Industrial Minister of India and in a sense, he had laid the foundation stone of India's progress in an inclusive and inclusive manner and laid the foundation stone for India's progress.
In 1991, the first industrial policy of independent India was based on its plan and vision.
Dr.
The dream of Mukherjee was that India will be self-sufficient, better and prosperous in every field of industry.
He wanted India to create a big industry and also focus on MSMEs, textiles, textiles and cottage industry.
For the proper development of cotton industry and micro-industries, he had set up finance and organisation setups, which led to the All-II between 1970 and 1950.
Shyama Prasad Mukherjee had a great contribution.
He was very emotional about the development of West Bengal.
His thoughts, consciousness and activity have saved a part of West Bengal and is still a part of India.
Let us remember the message of this unity of Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and continue to strive towards taking India forward through harmony and brotherhood.
My dear countrymen, for the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to talk to those who have benefited from various schemes of the government through video calls.
I had got the opportunity to hear from the files directly from the faces of the people and to change their lives.
People have said that their resolve, happiness and sadness, achievement.
I believe that this was not just a government event but it was another kind of learning experiment and what could be more satisfaction and satisfaction than the joy I have seen in the eyes of the people at this time
When a person used to listen to the common man, his simple words, his simple words, his feelings, he used to touch the heart.
I knew how the girls from far-flung villages have been helping in making passports from the Common Service Centre to the elderly and the elderly.
A sister of Chhattisgarh has been collecting ice-creams from it and making ice-creams from Jharkhand, as well as providing affordable medicines to lakhs of youngsters of the country along with running Jan Aushadhi system in Jharkhand.
The youth who were looking for jobs two-three years ago in West Bengal, now they are not only running their business with success, they have served 10-15 people.
On the other hand, schools in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Goa have been working on important issues like West Management in the school's Tinkering Lab at this young age.
There was a story of such innumerable experiences and there was no corner of the country from where there was no message of success.
I am happy to note that I have experienced the power of the success of the common man from the success of the government, the strength of the country and the power of the country, the strength of the dream of New India and the strength of the resolve.
Some people live in the society unless they talk desperately, do not talk about despair, do not work to create confidence, do not find ways to break instead of building, they do not get peace.
In such an environment, when the common man speaks about the achievements of his life with new hopes, new enthusiasm, then his achievements are not available to the government.
The Kahini of a small girl from a small village in a far-flung region also inspires 125 crore people.
I am grateful to the countrymen.
40-40, 50-50 lakh people have joined this video bridge programme and have given me new energy.
I once again express my gratitude to you.
I have also felt this aroma of good.
The fact is that the corporate professionals of Bangalore, IT engineers, together have created a comfortable prosperity trust and have acted to double the income of the farmers.
Through this trust, they have been associated with the farmers, have constructed schemes and have been making a positive effort to increase the income of the farmers.
With the help of new techniques of farming, how organic farming can be done and how to produce one crop and other crop, all these trainings are being provided to the farmers through this Trust.
Earlier, all the farmers who were dependent on only one crop, not only the crops but also the benefits. Today, they are not only harvesting several crops, they are gaining good profits by harvesting the crops through this trust.
Crops will be better only when good seeds are used and Seed Bank has been built separately.
Women are working on this Seed Bank and women are also associated with it.
My dear countrymen, one year of GST is going to be completed.
One Nation One Tax, which was the dream of the people of the country, has been realized today.
If I have to credit someone for this system, I will give this credit to the states.
GST is a beautiful example of Cooperative Federalism, where all the states have decided to take into account the welfare of the country together and as a result, such a big tax reform system has been started in the country.
So far, 27 meetings of the GST Council have been held and we can proud that the decisions taken in the GST Council have been taken so far, despite the representatives of different political thoughts, representatives of different states and different priority states.
Before the GST, there were 17 different taxes in the country but after the introduction of this system, only one tax system is in the country.
After the arrival of GST, check posts have also been stopped and there has been an increase in the movement of goods and other goods which will not only save time but also benefit in logistics sectors.
GST is perhaps the worlds largest tax reform system.
This big tax reform has been successful in India because the people of the country have adopted this system and this manpower has ensured the success of GST.
It is generally believed that it takes 5-7 years to implement such a huge population in such large countries.
But the enthusiasm of the honest countrymen, the flow of the festivals of the country's sovereignty and the participation of the people's sovereignty is that within a year, this new tax system has created its place, has got the status and has been amending itself through an inbuilt system.
This is a great achievement, which has achieved 125 crore Indians.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2018
You must remember that a team of six women commanders of the Navy had been sealing for the past few months.
I would like to say something about the name Nabika Sagar Parikrama.
The team of six daughters of India has returned to India on 21st May, 2019 through INSV Tarini for more than 250 days and the entire country has greeted them with warm welcome.
Approximately 22,000 nautical distances have been crossed through various oceans and some sea travels.
This is an unprecedented event all over the world.
Last Wednesday, I had the opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again I congratulate these daughters for their adventurous work, for enhancing the capability of the Navy, for enhancing Indias honour and particularly the daughters of India for reaching this message to the world.
You must have seen new information about Mount Everest-Jai people has been found in the last few days.
On 16th May, five tribal students from a Ashram-Vidyala in Chandrapur, Maharashtra, Manisa Dhurube, Pramesh Ale, Umakant Magabi, Kavidas Katmode and Vikas Swam, have won the world's highest series.
The training was started in Wardha, Hyderabad, Darjeeling and Leh-Ladakh since August 2017.
They were elected in Mission Shaurya.
And by winning Everest, they have brightened the name of the country.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to these small students of Chandrapur School.
Recently, the sixteen-year-old Shivangi reader has won Everest from Nepal as the youngest Indian woman.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter Dia Everest win the first father-son jute.
Not only the youth are winning Everest, but also the 150th Smt. Sangeeta Behl won the Everest on May 19th.
Some of the Everest climbers are those who are not only efficient but also experienced.
This work is not only admirable, but also a responsibilities towards cleanliness and environment.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all those brave heroes, especially the daughters.
A large number of people from different areas will come forward to support this issue.
On Fit in India, I believe that the country will play as much as we play.
In social media, people are sharing their fitness challenges and tagging others and challenging them.
I believe that this is a very good process and such challenges encourage us to remain fit and keep others fit.
My dear countrymen, many times in Mann Ki Baat, you have heard something about sportspersons from me.
Chhabi Yadavji, thank you very much for your phone
These sports were a special part of summer holidays.
There are two dresses in traditional sports.
There's also an outdoor and an indoor.
The unity between the diversity of our country may be seen in these sports.
The same sports are known at different places.
It was played at the Square Board of 8 BE 8 with a bitch or a bitch.
Its name is Attu in Madhya Pradesh, Pakidakali in Kerala, Champal in Maharashtra, Dyam in Tamil Nadu, Tham and Changpo in Rajasthan.
If the people of different states don't know each other's languages, they've seen them right at the time of playing.
It's a village-city game that can be seen everywhere.
It is also known in different parts of the country.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is known as Gotivilla or Karyavilla.
In Orissa, it is called a bullet, in Maharashtra it is called Bittidalu.
Traditional sports are such that along with physical capacity, our local thinking, concentration, awareness and enhancement of swelling.
And these are not just sports, they teach the values of our lives, to determine our goals to learn, to achieve strength, to build team spirit, to help each other.
A few days ago, I had seen that our traditional sports have been included in the training programmes of Business Management for the development of a collective personality and improving inter-parsonal skills.
At the same time, we are aware of our culture and traditions.
Some sports make us aware about our society, environment etc.
Now, the schools, schools and the youth should move forward and encourage these sports.
Through Crowd Sourcing, we can create a museum for our traditional sports.
This sports video can be made so that the rules of sports can be shown as to how to play.
Animation films can also be made so that our new generations can know about these games, play and grow up.
The theme is Beat Plastic Pollution.
Understanding the importance of this idea, I request you all to ensure that we do not use polythene, low grades plastic and try to reduce the harmful impact of plastic pollution on our nature, wildlife and our health.
I urge the World Environment Day website, Weddindia 2018 to see all the details and try to use it in your daily life.
There's been a loss of lives, wealth is damaged.
All these changes have been made in the White Weather Pattern.
This is what Mahatma Gandhi has said for his entire life.
Today, India is talking about climate justice, the COP 21 and the Paris Agreement. We have united the world through the International Solar Alliance.
On this Next Day, what can we do to make this world cleaner and greener
How can we move forward on this path, what can we innovate
Rainfall is coming.
Now we can plant a record number of trees and not only plantation, but it is also important to take care of till the tree grows.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends
You all remember the 21st June, not just you, but the whole world remembers the 21st June.
All over the world is now celebrated as International Day of Yoga on 21st June and it is convinced that preparations for this event have started a few months ago.
It is reported that preparations are being made to celebrate 21st June as International Day of Yoga all over the world.
Yoga enhances the courage that always protects us like father.
Forgiveness arises, like mother feels for her children, mental peace becomes our sustainable friend.
Bhatuhari said that by doing yoga regularly, the truth is our son, mercy is our brother, self-confidence, our brother, the world, our bed and knowledge works to destroy our hungry.
Whenever there are so many qualities, it is natural that Yoga wins all kinds of fears.
Once again, I urge all the countrymen to take forward the huge heritage of Yoga and create a healthy, happy and prosperous nation.
My dear countrymen, on 27th May, India's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's thirteenth day.
I salute Pandit ji.
In the month of May 1857, the Indians had shown their strength to the British.
In many parts of the country, our soldiers and farmers were embarrassed against injustice.
It is a matter of sadness that for a long time, we have been calling the event of 1857 as a rebellion or a soldier rebellion.
It was an attempt to hurt our self-esteem.
This brave Savarkar became innocent that what happened in 1857 was not an insurgency but the first fight for independence.
Savarkar was accompanied by the heroes of the India House in London in collaboration with the 50th birth anniversary of this event.
He was both a devotee of weapons and sciences.
Veer Savarkar, who is originally known for his struggle against Bahaduri and the British king.
Besides this, he was a brilliant poet and a social reformer who has always emphasized on harmony and unity.
Our dear, dear Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji has made a wonderful description about Savarkar Ji.
Savarkar is taking both poetry and revolution together.
Being a sensitive poet, he was also a brave poet.
Our daughters, who used to be forced to behave from the stupas of waste to the households, today they are learning the work of sewing and sewing the poor.
I convey my best wishes to these daughters full of hope and faith.
They have shown that if there is a jealousy to do something and you are committed to it, you will be able to achieve success in all the difficulties and it is not just a matter of sickness but in every corner of Hindustan you will be able to see it.
If you look at the neighbours around you, you will see how people are fighting the problem.
You have experienced that whenever we go to a tea shop, whenever we get satisfaction from eating tea there, there are discussions and discussions with some people.
These discussions are political, social, film, sports, sports and sportspersons, the problems of the country should be solved in such a way.
He organised education, health and food for all children coming to school.
He kissed the darkness of their lives.
'Tamso Ma Ma Matagaya:' who doesn't know this vedicity, but it has been shown by Diprakash.
His life is an inspiration for all of us, for the society and for the entire country.
Many hours of inspiration will be around you too.
There may be countless incidents.
Come on, let us move forward with positive mindset.
It's so hot in the month of June that people wait for the rains and hope for the clouds of the sky.
People will wait for the moon after some time from today.
Looking at the moon means the essence of the moon.
At the end of one month's fast at the time of Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a symbol of the start of a bright festival.
I believe that everybody will be happy to observe this festival, especially the children will benefit.
I hope that the festival of Eden will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
My best wishes to everyone.
My dear countrymen, thank you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2018
Recently, the Commonwealth Games were held in Australia from 4th April to 15th April 2019.
71 countries of the world, including India, participated in this event.
When such an event is organized, thousands of sportspersons from all over the world should participate in it and imagine how encouraging environment can be created
Our sportspersons also showcase the foolish sportspersons as per the hopes of the countrymen and win one medal after another.
Whether it is shooting, wrestling, weight lifting, table tents, or badminton, India has achieved record success in everything.
India won 66 medals with 26 gold, 20 silver and 20 silver.
This achievement has made every Indian proud.
After the end of the game, when the athletes of India with the medals were flagged off with the tricolour and played the medals at the victory stage, the feeling of national music, happiness, pride and respect, this is a unique experience.
But I want to hear from these sportspersons.
India's performance at the Commonwealth Games was very good and it was special.
Manika Batra won medals in all the events.
Manika Batra is the first Indian woman who brought India a gold medal in the personal Table Tennis.
The 15-year-old Indian shooter Anish Vanwala has been named as the youngest sportsperson of India in the field of Gold Medal.
He won the medal in Para Power Lifting at the Corps Games, India's only Chinese.
This is the reason that women players have won most of the medals.
Whether it is squash or boxing, weightweight or shooting, women sportspersons have shown their paramount.
At the end of Badminton, two Indian sportspersons Saina Nehru and P.
V.
The whole country has seen this game.
Sportspersons from different parts of the country have come from small towns.
A lot of obstacles have reached this place.
The achievements that they have achieved today, the lifestyle of their parents, parents, coaches, other helpers, schools, school teachers or schools have a significant role.
Their friends have also played a role in enhancing the mindset of sportspersons in every situation.
Together with the sportspersons, I thank them all.
Gentlemen, Shri Shashikant Bhosle, shared a picture of his swimming pool and said, My body is my weapon, my basic substance water, my world is swimming.
On the other hand, I feel myself happy and healthy by traveling in the morning by writing Ruma Devnath.
He added that fitness brings laughter, when we are happy, we will laugh.
Mrs. Devnath, there is no doubt that happiness or happiness is fitness.
The dragon is written with his trekking picture.
Traveling and trekking for me is fit in India.
It is a pleasure to see that many people are also very attractively motivating our youth for Fit India.
Chitrakoot Akshaykumar gave a video to the Twitter.
I've seen that video, you'll be watching, in this video, he's going to be exercising with a wooden piece of wood.
He said that this exercise is very beneficial for stomach and back muscles.
I think this kind of movement is very beneficial for all of us and for the entire country.
You're sure you're preparing.
On 21st June, the importance of International Day of Yoga has now been accepted by the entire world.
There is no need to tell anybody in India or in the world about the use of Yoga to keep the physical development, mental development and mental condition normal.
You might have seen an animated video where I've been shown.
I would like to thank the Animation Producers for taking care of the work that a teacher can do through animation.
My young friends, all of you have come out of the tests and are thinking of holidays.
I would like to invite you for a new job today.
I have seen that many youngsters are now spending time to learn something new.
Outside the four walls, there is an opportunity to live a new life from a distance of paper and computers.
My young friends, I would like to urge you for a special intervention today. Three-four Ministries of the Government of India such as Sports, Human Resource Development, Drinking Water Division.
All those who have done good work in colleges and universities will be awarded at the national level and those who have been successfully conferred upon them will be awarded at the national level.
Once again, I invite students and youngsters to join the internship and benefit.
I hope our youth will take forward the Swachhta Abhiyan.
I want to know about all your efforts.
You must send your experience, send stories, send pictures, send video.
Look at the India programme regularly, how many people from different parts of the country are doing good work and how good they are talking about.
A few days ago, I had seen some young children in Delhi who have been studying freely for the poor and poor children. These youngsters have started a comfortable study for the education of the children of Delhi.
Initially, he explained that the roadside and small working children were also involved in this developmental work.
Initiatives with 15 children from the settlements near Gita Colony in Delhi have become a part of the study of two thousand children in 12 places in the capital today.
In this campaign, young teachers have been making efforts to transform the society from their busyness for two hours of free time.
Brothers and sisters, Just like this, some farmers of Uttarakhand have established an inspiration to the farmers of the country.
They have changed their fate not only for themselves but also for their respective regions.
In Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, chicken, pomegranate, yoke are cultivated.
As the hilly areas, the farmers did not get the right price for their crops, but the farmers of the Copkot Fund had directly damaged their crops in the market and led them to the increase in the price of their crops and took the path of value addiction.
They have produced biscuits from the crops of the field and are selling biscuits in the area.
These farmers have built a government company in Munnar and have opened the biscuits.
After seeing the efforts of the farmers, the administration has included it in the National Livelihood Mission.
This biscuit has spread only to about 50 Anganwadi centres of Bagheshwar district and Kosani Almora.
This effort of the farmers has not only reached the Turn Over 10 to 15 lakhs but also provided food facilities to more than 900 families.
Dear countrymen, I have often heard that the war for water will start in the coming days.
Everyone says, but don't we have any responsibility
Water conservation is not new to Indians.
There is no need to read books, so there is no need to know any particular language.
Our ancestors have shown it in the past.
They gave maximum importance to the importance of every drop of water.
They have taken new ways to save every drop of water.
You will be able to see anybody visiting Tamil Nadu, in many temples there will be inscriptions on irrigation, water conservation process, water harvesting, lightning etc.
Large inscriptions are seen in the temples of Manarkobil, Chiran Mahadevi Kobilapatti and Pudukottai.
Even today, a lot of bouri is known as stepwells tourism sector, but in fact, it is a testimony to the efforts of our ancestors to conserve water.
If you go to Rajasthan, you will definitely visit the Chand Bauri of Jodhpur.
This is the largest and most beautiful buffalo in India, one thing we must remember is the largest buffalo in a region where there is a rapid water crisis.
Water conservation will be the best time for water conservation in April, May, June-July and the best time for water conservation.
Water conservation can be spent from Manrega Budget.
Several efforts have been made to build water conservation and water reservoirs in the last three years.
About 32,000 crore rupees have been spent in the Manrega Budget every year for water conservation and water dam construction.
Talking about the year 2017-18, I can say that out of 64,000 crore rupees, 55 per cent has been spent on water conservation schemes worth about Rs. 35,000 crore.
In the last three years, this water conservation and water reservoir has benefitted about 150 lakh hectares of agriculture.
This work has been done by the people of about 40-45 villages.
I will say, April, May, June and July are coming and we can take a lot of responsibility for water conservation and water harvesting in the coming days.
My dear countrymen, when Mann Ki Baat happens, there are many news from all over the country, letters and phones.
But the people do not know anything about the philosophy that is being saved with the peaceful, beauty and integrity of Rabindranath Tagore.
Please tell you about the Mann Ki Baat programme so that the common man can know it.
In his writings, he had a unique impression on all things, Rabindranath was a talented personality, a person of diverse thinking, but he had a teacher in him.
He wrote in Gitanjali: 'He who has the knowledge was the responsibilities to inpart it to the students', that is, the knowledge that he has, he has the responsibility to divide the knowledge with the inquisitive.
The comprehensive meaning of roasting is that when man is indifferent to himself, he feels hungry to others.
When he himself feels thirsty, he feels thirsty.
This is the time to remember the teachings and messages of the Paigambar Mohammad.
The education of his life creates our commitment to walk in the path of equality and brotherhood.
Once a Pegumber asked him, "What is the best thing in Islam
Paygambar said, Maintaining harmony with everyone to feed the poor and the vulnerable.
Paigambar Mohammad believed in knowledge and mercy.
He wasn't afraid of anything.
He used to say, Ahankara defeats wisdom.
If someone has anything more than required, you should give it to someone who needs it. This is why donor has special significance in Ramzan.
In this sacred month, everybody gave donations to the unexpected people.
Paygambar Mohammad believed that a person's own sacred soul wealth and not wealth.
My dear countrymen, Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We should be proud that the idol of compassion, service and sacrifice is the country of Lord Buddha who has guided millions of people of your world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of the great responsibility of striving, pledging and walking on the path shown by Lord Buddha.
Lord Buddha is the inspiration of equality, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
This is the human values that the world needs today.
Babasaheb Dr.
Ambedkar insisted that Lord Buddha had a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
He said, "My social philosophy may be said to be included in three words
Whether it is the people of the country, be it Dalit, afflicted, exploited or deprived, Babasaheb has strengthened the people of this interior level through the Constitution.
There can be nothing more than compassion.
This compassion of Lord Buddha was one of his greatest qualities for human suffering.
We all Asians have found the teachings of Lord Buddha inheritance.
This tradition of Buddha in many countries of China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar etc. is also linked to the roots of Buddha and that is why we are building Buddhist tourism infrastructure which connects the important places of Southeast Asia to India's famous Buddhist regions.
I bless the great man for the entire world as if we can fulfil our responsibilities in building a peaceful and compassionate world in his ideals.
Today, we recall Lord Buddha and you will be listening to the idol of 'Lafing Buddha' which is said to be the privilege of 'Lafing Buddha' but very few people know that this sympathy is also associated with an important event in the history of Buddha's security.
You might have thought that what could be the relationship between the Buddha and the Indian military forces.
You must remember that 20 years ago, on May 11, 1998, the then Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had delivered a speech to the people of India, which had inspired the entire country in a message of pride, pride and happiness.
While spreading around the world, there was a new self-confidence among the Indians.
That day was intellectual.
On May 11, 1998, atomic tests were conducted in Pokhran, Rajasthan in the western part of India.
Twenty years have been completed and the test was held on the day of Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
India's test was successful and India was able to showcase its strength in science and technology.
We can say that the day is marked as the day of its military power in India's history.
Lord Buddha has shown the world that inner strength is necessary for peace.
Thus, when you can become a nation, you can live peacefully with everyone.
It is not only important for the month of May 1998 that nuclear tests were conducted in that month, but the way it was possible is more important.
This incident showed the whole world that India has the power to reach new goals and heights by putting in front of the land of great scientists and a strong leadership.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji had given the mantra Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan.
Today, when we are going to celebrate the 15th anniversary of May 11, 1998, the mantra of Atal ji's Jai Vigyan' which we have given to India will have to go ahead with the goal of building a modern India and every youngster of the country will have to participate in the fight for making a strong India and a Support India.
We have to make our energy a part of Indias energy.
And then we will be able to achieve a new joy and a new satisfaction with the journey that Atal ji had started.
My dear countrymen, Mann Ki Baat will be connected again.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2018
On 26th January, ASEAN Group representatives had come here and brought together various cultural groups.
It is a matter of great pride that most of them had established Ramayana in front of us.
That is, not only in India but also in the ASEAN group countries of the world, the inspiration and influence of Ramayana is the same today.
My dear countrymen, I have received a lot of letters, e-mails, phone calls and opinions from you all.
I read what I wrote in MyGov about starting an online course of the soft culture.
Besides being an IT worker, I am very good to see your zeal towards Sanskrit.
I have asked the concerned department to give you all the information about this.
I urge all the audience who are working with the culture of Mann Ki Baat to think about how this proposal can be taken forward.
Shri Ghanshyam Kumar of Barakar village in Nalanda district of Bihar had a view on the Narendra Modi App.
The concerns you have expressed about the decreasing geographical water level are really important.
And Ayushman Bhoomi can happen only when we take care of every animal living in this land.
You have requested for water supply for animals and birds in the summer.
Shakal Ji, your thoughts have come to all the audience friends.
Mr. Yogesh Bhadresha said that I should say something about the health of the youth.
He said that the youngsters of our country are physically weak compared to other Asian countries.
A few days ago, the Honble President of France visited Kashi and wrote Shri Prashant Kumar of Varanasi that all the scenes of the journey were touched and inspired by him.
He expressed his interest that all those pictures should be broadcast on video social media.
The Government of India has shared all the pictures in the social media and the Narendra Modi App on that day.
I want to tell all the children like Angha, Jayesh that if these letters are sent to them, my whole day's dragon and hard work will flew away.
All these letters, so many phone calls, opinions, all that I have read, all that I have heard and all these things have touched my heart.
They wrote about their tests, divided the vacation plan, thought about the waterfall of animals and birds in this summer.
Farmer brothers and sisters have also sent me a letter to the people of the country about the Kisan Mela and the farming.
Some conscious citizens have advised me about water conservation.
During the festival, there are many letters about our festivals, our culture and traditions.
When I read the letters sent to you, I can know that Absolutely Ali, a Rickshawer from Karimganj, Assam, had built nine schools for the poor children with his will power, then the unprecedented will power of this country came to know.
When I heard the story of Dr. Ajit Mohan Saheb of Kanpur, who used to treat the footpath brothers and sisters and gave free medicines, then I was proud of the harmony and humanity of the country.
The next year, due to lack of treatment, Calcutta taxi driver Saidul Laskar's sister died.
A lot of such inspirations inspire my country.
Today, the whole world has seen India in other eyes.
Today, when the name of India is highlighted with great respect, the emergence of children and children of this country is hidden behind it.
My dear countrymen, the next few months will be very important for the farmers brothers and sisters.
Because there has been a lot of letters on agriculture.
This time I have seen the video of the DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan with the farmers friends and I felt that this DD Kisan channel of Doordarshan should be seen by all the farmers and should also use agricultural advice in their own fields.
Whether it is Mahatma Gandhi or Shastri ji, whether Lohia ji or Charan Singh or Saddev Devilal ji, they all considered agriculture and farmers as an important part of the economy and public life of this country.
Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri always emphasized the need for conservation of trees, plants, forests etc. and better agricultural processing.
Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia spoke of the need to make our farmers aware of better income, improved irrigation and ensuring these things and to promote food and milk production.
In 1997, Charan Singh in his address stressed the need for the farmers to use new technologies and innovate them.
Our Meghalaya farmers have produced record production in 2015-16 over the last five years.
They have shown that if the goal is stable, if there is complete self-confidence, if there is a commitment in the mind, then everything can be achieved.
Today, technology has been linked to the hard work of the farmers.
This has resulted in a lot of energy for agricultural producers.
I have seen the letters that have come to me, many farmer friends have written about MSP and they want to discuss this with them in detail.
Brothers and sisters, In this year's budget, a big decision has been taken to give farmers the right price.
It has been decided that MSP for certain crops will be at least one and a half times of investment.
Besides, the work on Agricultural Marketing Reform is underway in the country to ensure that farmers get the prices of crops.
Efforts are being made to connect the local markets of the village to the world.
The farmers will be upgraded to the required infrastructure of 20,000 rural haats in the country and will be connected to the APMC and e-NAM platform.
This means that such a system is being created from one kind of farm to any market of the country.
My dear countrymen, this year the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi is being celebrated.
How will the country celebrate this festival
Ask you to share your thoughts with all through MyGov.
What can happen to the people of Gandhi 150
All the work related to health was earlier taken over by the Health Ministry.
Privative health care is very cheap and easier.
As much as we are aware about the Privative Health Care, the individuals, the family and the society will benefit from this.
Cleanliness is the first condition to keep life healthy.
Besides, work is going on in the direction of setting up Health Wellness Centre across the country.
Yoga has created a new identity in the world as a 'Preventive Health Care'.
Yoga promises to be both healthy and efficient.
It is the result of our commitment that Yoga has become a mass movement and has reached home.
This year International Day of Yoga is not left for 21st June and 100 days.
In the last three International Day of Yoga, people from all over the country and abroad have participated with great enthusiasm.
We have to ensure that we will join ourselves and encourage everyone to join the family.
In a new and innovative form, Yoga has to be popularised among children, youth and adults, be it men or women.
The country's television and electronic media have different programmes on Yoga.
But what can you create awareness about Yoga as an expedition from now to Yoga Day
My dear countrymen, I am not a teacher of Yoga, but I am Yoga practice.
Some people have made me a teacher of Yoga through their own thoughts and have made 3-D animated video of my Yoga.
I would like to share this video with you so that we can practice asanas and pranayama together.
Efforts are being made to ensure that the healthcare is inconvenient, be it inconvenient, affordable and affordable for the people.
Today, more than 3,000 Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country, where more than 800 medicines have been sold at affordable prices.
More new centres are being opened.
Heart State prices for heart patients have been reduced to 85.
The cost of artificial knees has also been reduced to 50 to 70.
Under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, about 10 crore families i. e.
The number of MBBS seats in the existing 479 Medical Colleges in the country has been increased to about 68,000.
In every three districts, new medical colleges will be opened.
You need your help to bring this awareness to every person.
To get rid of tuberculosis, we all have to work together.
Many years ago, Dr. Ambedkar spoke of Indias industrialization.
In his thinking, industrialization is a powerful medium, which will result in the income of the poorest of the poor.
Dr. Ambedkar had dreamt: India will once become a powerful centre for labour industry.
Today, when the 'Make in India' programme is being successfully launched across the country, his dream is a vision of our inspiration.
India's position in the world economy is like a bright map and the highest foreign investment is in India.
Global trade is now looking at India as we are now becoming the centre of investment and innovation.
Dr. Ambedkar was deeply convinced of self-reliance and self-reliance.
Dr. Ambedkar said that even a person of the country does not live in poverty.
He also believed that poverty cannot be overcome by giving donations to the poor.
Today, projects like Mudra Yojana, Start-Up India, Stand-Up India are creating young entrepreneurs in our country.
Like him, the visionary people had said that the rivers and valleys are the maintenance of the Parliament, imagined that water conservation and utilization will be the working committee.
Today, the historic development of waterways and ports has started in the country.
The work of reforming new ports and old ports is also being done on various sea shores of India.
In the decade of 1970, when the world was imagining the second war, the cold war between the two powers and the tension of the country, Dr. Ambedkar imagined the spirit of Team India or India.
He understood the importance of federalism or friendship and therefore he believed that the central and the states should work together for the development of the country.
Today, we have been inspired by the Ministry of Cooperative Federalism and competitive collaboration of the United States at every level of Indo-Governance.
The most important thing is that Dr. Ambedkar is an inspiration for a number of people like me in the backward communities of the country.
India is very different: This is an India that is the year of Ambedkar, the poor and the backward.
The Gram Swaraj Abhiyan is being organized across the country from 14th April to 5th May, surrounding the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar.
The country will have several programmes for rural development, poverty and social justice.
I urge you all to participate in this national campaign.
My dear countrymen, in a few days, many festivals and festivals are coming: Mahavir Jayanti, Hanuman Jayanti, Easter and Vaishakhi.
On the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti, the day to remember the sacrifice and penance of Lord Mahavir.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavir, the propagator of Ahimsa, is an inspiration for us.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti.
Easter Eley gives us the idea of Christ, who wanted humanity peace, goodwill, justice, mercy and compassion.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you on the coming festivals.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2018
We have seen that the colour of the sea looks blue, but from our daily experience, we know that there is no color of water.
Have we ever thought whether it is sea or water becomes colorful
This question was a young man in the 1920s.
This question was the generation of a great scientist in modern India.
When we talk about science, Bharat Ratna Sir C.
He was awarded the award for excellent work on light skating or radiation.
His discovery is known as 'Roman Effect'.
We celebrate 28th February as National Science Day every year, because it is said that on this day he discovered the light skating for which he was awarded the award.
Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose and Hargovind Khurana, scientists like Satyendra Nath Bose are proud of India.
The famous particle named Satyendra Nath Bose has also been named as Boson.
Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in a function in Mumbai. I have inaugurated the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence.
It is very attractive to know the surprising work in the field of science.
With the help of Artificial Intelligence, collaboration is in the field of making robots, butts and manufacturing machines.
Today, through self-laurning, various machines are making their intelligence smart.
Technology can help in improving the lives of poor, deprived and helpless people.
In this programme of Artificial Intelligence, I would like to tell the scientists that what kind of artificial intelligence can be provided to facilitate the lives of Divyang brothers and sisters
Can we have a better prediction of natural disasters through artificial intelligence
Can Artificial Intelligence facilitate the Nagalpava of healthcare
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate the ICRIET event in Ahmedabad, Gujarat with the Prime Minister of Israel.
There a young man said that he has made a digital instrument where if anyone cannot talk, then it becomes frightened and you can talk to a person who cannot talk about it.
I think we can use artificial intelligence.
Science and Technology Valueutral.
You don't have any values.
Any machine will do the same thing we want.
But it depends on us how we want to work from the machine.
Tomsalva Edison, the inventor of Light Bulb, failed many times in his work.
Once asked him about this, he said, "I have discovered ten thousand ways of not making the light," meaning Adison has made his own failure.
It is a privilege for me to be in Aroville, the workforce of Maharshi Arvind.
As a leader, he challenged the British administration, fought against them, put their rule in the face of the question.
In this way, he asked for every question of life like a great sage, finding answers and guiding humanity.
It is important to ask questions again and again to know the truth.
On the occasion of National Science Day, I congratulate our scientists and all those associated with science.
Friends, I have a lot of messages about safety and disastrous times and people send me something or the other.
From Pune, Shri Manorvindra Singh has sent his address on the Acuperational Safety at the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
He wrote that in our country, safestanded is not good in place of toilets and construction work.
If we are not aware of safety in our daily life, if we are unable to earn security, it is difficult to ensure security during any major threat or malnutrition.
It will be seen that after removing natural misery, most of the accidents are the consequences of our mistakes.
If we are cautious, follow the necessary rules, then we can save our lives and protect our society from any big accident.
Sometimes I have noticed that there are several guidelines regarding safety in the field of work, but these rules are not followed at all.
I urge all the municipalities and municipalities that have fire brigades once a week, but at least once a month, go to different schools and take a mock drill in front of the students.
It will be of two beneficial benefits to be cautious and younger generations will be able to learn a lot.
Today, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) is leading all over the country to deal with corruption.
A scheme called APDA Mitra has been launched to train volunteers in cyclone or individual districts.
Training and awareness are very important.
Thousands of people lost their lives every year in Lu or Hit Wave for two-three years ago.
Since then, NDMA organised a workshop on Heat Wave Response and launched a campaign to enhance awareness.
We have a good result in all the joint initiatives.
In 2017, the number of deaths due to the temperature circulation decreased unprecedentedly in about 220.
It can be understood from this that only if we give importance to safety then we can be safe .
I would like to honour all of them who are present in the events in the moments and help the victims in the rescue operations.
The number of heroes like this is not very low.
Besides, you are always in danger, the Friend Rescue Services, the National Disaster Response Forces, the Para-Military Force and the Armed Forces, who rescued others from the risk of their lives.
A few days ago, India and other BI MSTEC countries i. e. Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bhutan and Nepal participated in this Exercise led by India.
We all heard them many times.
But today if someone takes us to the plane and asks us where it's kept, where the live jacket is, how to use it, I am sure no one can answer it.
If we are aware of our security, then the security of the society is also included in it.
My dear countrymen, in this year's budget, emphasis has been laid on wasteto wealth and wasteto energy manufacturing through biogas in villages to create Swachh Bharat.
Efforts have started for this and have been named as GOBAR Dhan, Galvanising Organic Bio-Agro Resources.
The objective of the GOBAR Dhan Yojana is to clean the villages and to produce income and energy from the compost and bio-gas by transforming the remaining waste in the field after cattle and cultivation of animals.
Any European country and sugarcane cattle and other biological ends are used to produce energy.
But in India, it was not being fully used.
We are moving in this direction by incorporating it into the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen scheme.
Animals like cattle cattle, residue waste after agriculture, waste of kitchen, all these have been set to be used for bio-gas based energy generation.
Through the Govar-Dhan scheme, the farmers of rural India, the rural brothers and sisters will be encouraged so that they see cow dung and waste not just as waste but as a source of income.
Self-sufficiency will also increase by using biogas in cooking and power generation.
This will help in increasing the income of farmers and animal husbandry.
There will be new employment opportunities in the field of Wastecollection, Transportation, Bio-Gas Selling.
A Online Trading Platform will be created to effectively implement the Gobar Dhan scheme which will connect the farmers to the buyers so that farmers get the right price for cow dung and agricultural waste.
I would urge the enthusiasts, especially the sisters of the villages to come forward and create a self-help group, organise a support committee and use this opportunity.
Let me invite you all, let us also join the movement of Clean Energy and Green Jobs and be in the process of transforming the waste of our villages into wealth and making cow silver from Govar.
But , in Raipur of Chhattisgarh we came to know about an unparalleled effort , and this is the first ' Waste Festival ' organized in this state .
The Festival organized by Raipur Municipal Corporation was aimed at enhancing awareness about cleanliness, creation of waste materials in the city and creating awareness about various ways of reuse of carbage.
I convey my best wishes to the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the people of Chhattisgarh and the government and the administration there for displaying the importance of waste management and cleanliness in a new way.
International Women's Day is celebrated every year on 8th March.
Various events are held in the country and the world.
Those women who have done integral work in various fields in the last few days have been awarded the Women's Shakti Puraskar in the country.
Today, the country is moving towards women-led development except women's development.
Today, at this moment, I feel a song of Swami Vivekananda.
This idea of Swamiji, a hundred and twenty-five years ago, reflects the spirit of women power in Indian culture.
Today, it is the responsibility of all of us to ensure equal participation of women in every field of social and economic life.
Today, our women power has shown self-confidence and self-confidence through their work.
They have not only moved ahead but have also taken the country and the society forward and have worked to take it to a new height.
Finally, our dream of New India is that where women are equally empowered, strong and partners in the development of the country.
A few days ago, a man gave me a great advice.
He suggested that on 8th March, Women's Day celebrations are held, but what can be organized to honour all the mothers and sisters who have completed 100 years in every village and town
This number is not small. 15 lakh women have been organised and have been running Swachhta Abhiyan for a month.
In this campaign that started on January 26, 2018, in just 20 days, these women have set up a new example by constructing 1 lakh 70 thousand toilets.
14 lakh women, 2 thousand women panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water-helds, 10 thousand women Swachhagrahis and 50 thousand women Rajmastries.
You can imagine how big it is
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women's power is such a power of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which will make the Swachhta Abhiyan in everyday life, the transformation of Swachhta in a rapid way to the people.
Brothers and sisters, Just two days ago, I was watching the News that the three villages of Elephanta Islands had been electrified seventy years after independence and how much joy and enthusiasm have been shown to the people there.
You are very well aware that Elephanta Island is between the sea 10 kilometers away from Mumbai.
This is an important tourist destination.
I am amazing to know that it is near Mumbai and despite being such a big center of tourism, electricity has not reached Elephant even after so many years of independence.
For seventy years, three villages of Elephanta Islands - Rajbandar, Morbandar and Santbandar, the darkness that had been covered in the lives of the people there, all these darknesses were removed and their lives were bright.
I congratulate the administration and the people there.
I am glad that now the caves of Elephanta and Elephanta will be lighted in the light of electricity.
This is not just a power but a new beginning in front of development.
My dear brothers and sisters, a few days ago, we have celebrated the Shivratri festival.
The importance of Holi festival is the holicade, the more the importance of holicades, the more it is said, the evil is being burnt in the fire and destroyed.
On the day of Holi, sitting together in all the monasteries, sharing each other's happiness, sharing of happiness, a beautiful moment and holi festival is a message of love, unity and harmony.
My dear countrymen, thank you very much
And two days ago, we celebrated the Republic Day solidarity.
It was the first time in history that the top leaders of ten countries were present at the function.
My dear countrymen, Shri Prakash Tripathi wrote a long letter to me in the Narendra Modi App. He expressed his desire that I should touch the letters written by him.
He wrote, "February 1, the death day of Kalpana Chaula, a spacecraft.
He has taken care of us in the Kalambia spacecraft accident but the world has inspired millions of youngsters.
I express my gratitude to Bhai Prakash ji for initiating his long letter of imagination with the departure of Chir Chaular.
If there is a desire and a strong commitment, if there is anxiety to do something, nothing is impossible.
Several farmers of the country have contributed immensely to the creation of various parts of the Vedas.
Lopamudra, Gorgie, Maitrey. I don't know how many names
Today we talk about 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' but hundreds of years ago in our scriptures, in Skandhapuran, Dasputra, Samakna, Dasputra Promotion.
This is the greatness of our society.
And that is why women have been given the status of power in our society.
This lady power binds the entire country, the entire society and the family with unity.
Shri Prakash Tripathi then gave many more examples.
He wrote, Our brave Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's 'Sukhoi-30' warship will inspire him.
Three adventurous women Bhavna Kanth, Mohan Singh and Avni Chaturvedi have been the drivers of the warships and are currently training the Sukhoi-30 warships.
Today, there are many areas where women are living in front of us. Our women are showing something or the other.
This has been integrated as an e-book in the Narendra Modi website.
Today, women play an important role in the ongoing positive changes of the country and the society.
Today, when we talk about women empowerment, I would like to mention a railway station.
A railway station and women empowerment. You might be thinking about what could be the link between them.
Matunga station in Mumbai is the first railway station in India where all level employees are women.
Women workers in all sections.
Whether it is a commercial department or a railway police or a ticket observer or announcing person or a point person or more than forty women workers are joining this station.
Today our women power is leading from the front.
When the tribal women talk about, they all feel that there will be a picture of jungles and mountains, there will be a vision of girls moving forward in the minds of the children.
But our tribal women in Chhattisgarh, our women power has made a new picture in front of the country.
Dantewada region of Chhattisgarh, which is one of the Maoist-affected areas.
Violence, atrocities, bombs, guns, pistols have created a terrible environment there.
Tribal women living in such a contradictory state are making their own self-reliant by e-rickshaws.
In a very short span of time, all the women there have become participants of this process.
On the one hand, they are empowering themselves through self-employment as well as changing the pictures of Maoist-affected areas.
Besides, it is also possible to provide special energy to the environmental conservation.
I also appreciate the district administration from grants to training, the district administration is playing an important role in the success of these women.
We have heard again and again that people say, "Who is something that doesn't lose our existence.
Determination of the negative disadvantages, acceptance of the reforms of what is necessary.
And the specialty of our society is to continue the process of soul-reform.
The identity of a living society lies in the process of self-reform.
For centuries, efforts against social evil and evil policy are continuing in our country in a personal and social way.
Through this campaign, efforts are being made to create awareness against social curse such as child marriage and chaos.
He was sworn in in the State for fighting ill-ethics such as hypocrisy and hypocrisy.
Children, elderly, enthusiastic and enthusiastic youngsters, mothers and sisters all have embarrassed themselves in this fight.
Starting from the historic Gandhi Maidan of Patna, this man-service began to reach the boundaries of the state.
It is necessary for all the people of the society to participate in the actual development process that such policies are free of cost.
Let us all resolve to overcome such evil policies together and build a New India, a strong and efficient India.
I compliment the people of Bihar, the Chief Minister of Bihar, the administration of the state, the Shamil in the human system for discovering such special and comprehensive issues for social welfare.
My dear countrymen, Shri Darshan from Mysore in Karnataka wrote in MyGov that his father used to spend Rs. 6,000 every year for treatment.
He was not aware of the first Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
However, whenever he came to know about Jan Aushadhi Kendra, he bought medicines from there and reduced prices of up to 15.
He expressed his desire that I should talk about Mann Ki Baat while talking about it so that more people can get information about it.
Many people have been writing to me about this.
I have also seen a lot of video and social media that they are taking advantage of this scheme.
And when I know this kind of thing, I feel very happy.
I've got a deep satisfaction.
And I was very happy to note that Shri Darshan ji's feelings and the benefits he had received from others.
This will benefit the common man, particularly the elderly people who are forced to take medicines everyday.
The life-saving medicines purchased from here are manufactured in accordance with the approved standards of the World Health Organization.
This is the main reason for affordable quality medicines.
Today more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been set up across the country.
These are not only affordable medicines but also new employment opportunities for individual entrepreneurs.
Affordable medicines are available at Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendra and Amrit Stores in the hospital.
The only objective behind these is to provide quality and affordable healthcare to the poorest of the poor in the country so that a healthy and prosperous India can be built.
My dear countrymen, Shri Mangesh has shared a picture in the Narendra Modi App from Maharashtra.
The picture was such that my attention was attracted to that film.
A grandmother had joined the clean morna River sanitation campaign with his grandmother.
I have come to know that the citizens of Akola organized Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to clean the Mornah river.
Morna river used to flow twelve months ago, but now it is dependent on the weather.
Another sad thing is that the river was filled with wild grass and cattle water.
There was a lot of waste in the river and around it.
Hence, an Action Plan was set up and the first phase of Mission Clean Morna from 13th January to 4 kms from the first phase of Makar Sankranti was cleaned on both the sides of the Morna river at four places.
This Swachhta Abhiyan was continued on 20th January and I am told that this campaign will continue every Saturday morning till the Morna river is completely cleaned.
Through this, it is understood that if a person takes a determined pledge to do something then nothing is impossible.
It is possible to bring big changes through the mass movement.
I congratulate the people of Akola, the administration of the districts and the corporations and all the citizens associated with making this work a mass movement.
My dear countrymen, you have also heard a lot of discussions about Padma Puraskar.
Discussions on news papers and television have attracted attention.
It will be a matter of pride for you to be proud of what kind of great people are among us and it will be a matter of pride that how the common man of our country is reaching this height without any suggestion.
Every year there is a tradition of Padma Puraskar, but in the last three years, its entire process has changed.
Now any citizen can adjust any person.
Cleanliness has come to this for the entire process to be online.
It is said that the election process of this award has changed completely.
Those people who are not seen in big cities, news papers, TVs and events have been given Padma Awards.
Now there is no individual identity in the awards, but the importance of his work is increasing.
You might have heard about Shri Arvind Gupta ji.
He has been creating sports from four decades offensive so that children can enhance curiosity towards science.
He is trying to encourage children from useless things to scientific experiments.
For this, three thousand schools in different parts of the country are inspiring children to showcase films made in 18 languages.
This is the case of Sitaba Jodatti of Karnataka.
He is not called the goddess of women empowerment.
For the last three decades, he worked greatly for the transformation of life of countless women in Belagavi.
He dedicated himself as a goddess at the age of seven, but then added his entire life to the welfare of the goddesses.
Not only this, he has done unprecedented work for the welfare of Dalit women.
You can hear the name of Bhajju Shyam of Madhya Pradesh. Shriman Bhajju Shyam was born in a poor family and tribal family.
He used to serve a simple job for living but he was keen to create traditional tribal paintings.
Today, he is honoured not only in India but also in the entire world.
His pictures have been exhibited in many countries like Egypt, Germany, England, Italy.
Bhajju Shyamji's talent to brighten India's name abroad has been recognized and he has been honored with Padma Shri.
You will be surprised to hear the story of the tribal lady Laxmikutty of Kerala.
Laxmikutti educated in Kollar area and still lives in the shadow huts in the tribal areas in the middle of dense forests.
He has prepared 500 medicines based on his memory.
He has the ability to produce snake bite medicines.
Laxmi ji has always served people from his knowledge about this herbal medicine.
This ignorant person has been identified and awarded Padma Shri for his participation in the society.
Today, I would like to mention another name and the 15th year Subhasini Mistry of West Bengal has also been awarded.
Subhasini Mistry is such a woman who has bought utensils in the house of others to build a hospital and sold vegetables.
When he was thirty years old, his husband died due to lack of treatment and this incident inspired him to build a hospital for the poor.
Today, thousands of poor people are being treated free of cost in the hospitals built due to their hard work.
I firmly believe that there are many such men-jewels, women-jewels that no one knows, no one knows.
Sometimes we should bring such people in schools and colleges to know their experiences.
Outside the award, there should be some efforts in the society.
My dear countrymen, every year not January, we celebrate Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas.
This is the day when the revered Mahatma Gandhi came to India from South Africa.
Today, we celebrate the festival of unbreakable bondage among Indians and Indians living in different parts of the world.
This year, on the occasion of Pravasi Bharatiya Diwas, we organized an event where all the members and mayors of Indian origin from different countries of the world were invited.
You will be happy to know that the event was attended by Indian dynasty MPs and mayors from Malaysia, 1970, Switzerland, Portugal, Mauritius, Fiji, Tanzania, Kenya, Canada, Britain, Suriname, South Africa, America and other countries.
Our Indian dynasty people who live in different countries of Europe are working with cyber security and some are associated with Ayurveda, some are enjoying the minds of the society through music or poetry.
I would like to thank the Europeans for this remarkable work, for recognition of the Indian diaspora and for their informing the people of the world through them.
On 3rd January, the revered Bapu Punya Tithi, who showed us a new path.
These were not just the original elements.
At present, we can see the message of Bapu at every step.
If we take a pledge that we will walk on the path of Bapu, we will walk as much as we can, then what else can be more than that
My dear countrymen, I conclude to all of you by conveying my best wishes to all of you on the 18th anniversary.
Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2017
This is the last phase of Mann Ki Baat celebrations this year and the last day of the year 2017 is the wonderful culmination.
This year, I and you have shared a lot of things for almost a year.
The exchange of letters, comments and opinions written by you during the Mann Ki Baat programme always fills me with a new spirit.
Years will change only after a few hours, but this sustainability of our dialogue will continue.
In the next New Year, we will talk about new things and share new experiences.
My best wishes and congratulations to you all for the New Year 2018.
A few days ago, the festival of Holly Christmas was celebrated all over the world.
This festival is celebrated with great joy throughout India.
On this occasion of Christmas, we recognise the teachings and teachings of Christian Christianity and the most emphasis on Jesus Christianity is the service spirit.
This service is also observed in the SarasattiBibel.
Ramkrishna Paramhansadeva has also said that Shiva is serving life in knowledge and all these things have human values throughout the world.
Dear countrymen, this year was also the year of 350th Prakash Parv of Guru Gobind Singh Ji.
Gurus, poets, poets, great warriors in Ekadhar have always inspired human beings.
He has learned to be a society against injustice and atrocities and has shown the path of freedom from the bonds of nation and religion.
And in this endeavour he had to lose a lot in his personal life, but he never gave up his feelings.
Every moment of his life was full of love, sacrifice and peace.
Come, we are committed to inspire the teachings of Guru Gobind Singh ji and his great life philosophy and embrace his ideals in our life.
You will be surprised to think that the new year comes every time and every time Pailajanuari comes every time, what is going to be a special day
The entire India is eager to welcome you in the 21st century.
You must be proud of yourself in the 21st century election.
The power of exchange is the greatest strength of democracy.
Because you can also play an important role in building India in the 21st century and it is going to start from PaulaJanuary.
On this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I wanted to specifically address the strength of the 18-25-year Tagbag life force.
I believe that the dream of a New India will be fulfilled by filling the skills and energy of the youth full of life.
The New India that we are talking about in the coming days is a toxic India of racialism, communalism, terrorism and corruption.
Cleanliness and poverty free India.
The New India, which will have the power to be peace, unity and harmony.
Take a road for yourself, connect those whom you are associated with yourself, and be it rich and prosperous.
Think how will we plan before 2022
Mahatma Gandhi gave the form of a mass movement for freedom.
My young friends, it is a period of time that we also give the dream of a beautiful and economic India a mass movement in the 21st century.
Today, a lot of opportunities have been created for the youth.
From Skill Development to Innovation and Entrepreneurship, our youth are moving and successful.
I would like to see how the news of these projects can be made available at any place of New India Youth and there should be an arrangement in this regard so that on the completion of eighteen years of age, it can easily discover all these things in this world and it can take necessary benefits.
My dear countrymen, I had spoken to you about the positiveity of the previous Mann Ki Baat programme.
Nothing is impossible for a person full of positivity and enthusiasm.
Everyone in English also said - Pacificism Leedsto Wikness, Optimism to Power.
In the previous Mann Ki Baat programme, I had requested the people to welcome their positive moments in 2017 and a positive atomsphere in 2018.
I am glad that people have shared their experiences and shared their experiences in a large number of social media platforms, MyGov and Narendra Modi App.
Millions of Positive India Hashtags have been switched to more than 1.
The transmission of a economy has started in India and spread all over the world.
The tweet arrespons that came in were inspiring.
There was a feeling of happiness.
Some people have discussed all those incidents that have had a significant impact in their minds this year.
Some people shared their personal availability.
Sound byte  Minname Minu Bhatia.
I live in Peace One, Phase One, Delhi.
 My name glows Rajendra.
And he died in the accident.
We know what happened to us at that time.
We were very beneficial with the help of this government and we were able to handle the situation.
 My name's satisfaction.
The National Highway was constructed from different villages near our village in 2017.
The two events that our Indian soldiers have done, one the surgical strikes made by Pakistani politicians, which destroyed the launch pads of the rebellion, and at the same time, the valour of our Indian soldiers in Doklam was unparalleled.
 My name is Satish Bewani.
Over the last forty years, there was a problem of water in our area and we were dependent on the pipeline manufactured by the Army.
Now our pipeline has been delicate.
So it's not our big deal in 2017.
There are many people who work at their own level so that there is a positive change in the lives of many people.
In fact, this is the New India that we are building together.
Let us enter in 2018 with these small joys, start the New Year and take strong steps towards Positive India.
When we're all talking about positive, I'm also trying to share one thing.
Recently, I came to know about the inspirationalists of Topper Anjum Bashir Khan Khatak, the administrative service of Kashmir.
He took off from the slaughter of hatred and hatred and topped the examination of the Administrative Service of Kashmir.
You might know that in 1994 the Ugrids burnt his ancestor's house.
There was a lot of fugitiveness and violence that his family had to leave their ancestors.
The atmosphere of such violence around a young child was enough for darkness and stiffness in the heart but Anjum did not let it happen.
He never gave up hope.
Today, he has inspired not only the youth of Jammu and Kashmir but also the youth of the entire country.
Anjum has proved that no matter how bad the situation is, the desperate clouds can be destroyed through positive work.
I had a meeting with some of the daughters of Jammu and Kashmir last week.
This is the strength of the country, this is our youth, this is the future of my country.
My dear countrymen, it is very natural to discuss the Sabarimala temple of Kerala when the world's famous religious places are discussed.
In this world famous temple, millions of devotees attend the blessings of Lord Ayappa Swami every year.
The place where such devotees come to such a large number of people, where such great importance is there, how big challenge can cleanliness be there
And especially those places which are in the middle of the mountains and jungles.
P.
A police officer named Vijayan started a programme called 'Punyam Punkavanam' and started a Swachhta Abhiyan to create awareness about cleanliness.
He is a pilgrimage pilgrimage unless he works for cleanliness, his pilgrimage will not be completed.
There are no small differences in this campaign.
Every pilgrimage has been participating in the Swachhta Abhiyan as part of the worship of God in some way or the other.
Every morning, there is a wonderful scene of this safari and all the pilgrims join it.
Be it a celebrities or be it a rich person or be it a big officer or be it a common pilgrimage - everybody participates in the Punyanam Punkavanam programme and they have to move ahead with cleanliness.
There are many examples for the countrymen.
The Swachhta Abhiyan is moving forward in Sabarimala, Punnam Punkavanam was successful and the pilgrims participated in it.
And we have pledged that when Bapu will be the 150th birth anniversary then we will do something or the other to offer Swachh Bharat to his dream.
Efforts are being made across the country for cleanliness.
A lot of people are participating in rural and urban areas and changes are being achieved.
Swachh Survekshan 2018 will be held in the world from 4th January to 10th March, 2018 to examine the progress of cleanliness at the urban level.
The programme will be implemented in more than 4,000 cities among the 40 crore people.
The Swachhta App will analysis for improving the availability and service sector.
This will be seen in the nature of every citizen of the city in the process of keeping the city clean and transforming the habits of the city.
My dear countrymen, some things seem to be very small, but it becomes far-reaching for a society.
Today, in this programme Mann Ki Baat, I mention such an event.
This injustice has been done to Muslim women for decades
He has not given the right to Muslim women in our country.
I feel very nice, our government has focused on this thing.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs has taken important steps in this regard and this 70-year-old tradition has transformed it into a barrier.
Today, a Muslim woman can go to Hajkar without Mahram and I am glad that about 1300 Muslim women have requested to visit Mahram Sahaj and from different parts of the country - from Kerala to Uttar Bharat - Muslim women have expressed their desire to go to Hajj.
I have advised the Minority Affairs Ministry to get permission from those women who want to go to Haj alone.
Our efforts will be to ensure that our women get equal rights, equal opportunities, so that they can equally participate in the path of progress.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is a historic day of our country.
However, the day of January 26, 2018 will be remembered.
This has never happened before in India's history.
The year 2017 was remarkable for both ASEAN countries and India.
ASEAN has completed 50 years this time and 25 years of Indias MoU with ASEAN countries have been completed in 2017.
We are proud of the meeting of the 10 great leaders of the world on January 26.
Dear countrymen, this is the season of festivals and our country is a country of festivals.
Perhaps there's no day when there's no festival.
Recently, we all celebrated Christmas, and the new year is coming forward.
May the New Year bring happiness, prosperity and happiness to all of you.
We all move forward with new entrepreneurs, new zeals, new hopes and resolves and the country also moves forward.
In January, Surya Uttarayan was held and the festival of Makar Sankranti was celebrated.
It's a festival related to nature.
On the one hand, each of our mountains is attached to natural accidents in some way, but the ways of observing these incidents of nature are different in our diversity.
All these festivals were divided between 13th and 17th January.
The name of these festivals is different, but the same factor in its depth is the combination of nature and agriculture.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for all the festivals.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you on New Year 2018.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2019
There will be no one who does not remember or respect him all over India.
He is a witness to all of us and the events of the country.
On September 28, he completed the ninth year.
I was fortunate to talk to my sister on the phone before traveling abroad.
This story was exactly the same as a younger brother spoke to his elder sister with great respect.
Modi ji: Latadidi, salute.
I'm talking about Narendra Modi.
Lataji: Salute.
Modi ji: I had called for this because now on your birthday, Modi ji: I will be busy traveling by air.
Modi ji: I'm back on 28th night, and even on 29th morning, your birthday will pass.
All right, okay.
Lataji: Many people grew up in age, but the blessings of those who grew up with their own work are very big.
Yes, but I believe that this is the blessings of my parents and the blessings of all the listeners.
Modiji:..
I am glad when you proud that your mother was Gujarati...
No, I don't want to hurt you anymore because I can see and I know how busy you are and how much you do.
What do you have to think
When you brought your mother's footsteps, I also sent one to him to bless him.
Modi ji: My mother was very happy to see this love of you.
Once again, my best wishes to you on your birthday.
But it was so busy that I couldn't take time.
Yeah, yeah, sure
My dear countrymen, along with Navratri, the movement of festivals will once again be filled with new zeal and resolve.
It's the season of the festival
The festival will continue to be happy and bright for a few weeks across the country.
The house will be filled with happiness.
But you must have seen that there are many people around us who are deprived of the joy of the festival.
And this is the darkness under the lamp.
Perhaps this debate is not just a matter of fact, it is an instruction for us, a philosophy, an inspiration.
Think, on one side some houses are lighted in light
On the other hand, in front of him, some people in the neighbourhood put darkness in the house.
In some houses, sweets are destroyed, and in some houses children are sweet for sweets.
At least, additional or untransmitted things can be delivered out.
In many cities, the start-ups of many NGO young friends are doing this.
They collect dresses, sweets, food from the people's house and then find the poor and the poor and get the things to them.
Can we sleep that darkness beyond the coast of Pradip with complete awareness and determination in this season of festival this time
Laxmi was welcomed in traditional traditions.
Girls are considered Lakshmi in our culture because girls bring fortune and prosperity.
This year, can we have a massive programme to honour the girls in our society, in villages and in cities
Can we keep the programme of honouring these Laxmis of India in this Diwali
There are many daughters around us, many daughters who are doing excellent work.
Some people are working to teach the poor children, some are creating awareness about cleanliness and health, some are serving the society as doctors and engineers.
May our society be proud of these daughters in respect and respect.
The Prime Minister said that the programme of honouring them is all over the country.
You can do one more thing, share this girl as much as possible in social media and use Hashtagbharatkilaxmi.
As we all had together launched a massive campaign called Selfie with Dotter, which spread all over the world.
My dear countrymen, during the Mann Ki Baat programme, I have already said that I am fortunate to have a direct or indirect conversation with many familiar people.
A few days ago, a student from Arunachal Pradesh Alina Tayong has sent me a very attractive letter.
I'm Roeing, Arunachal Pradesh.
I like reading and reading. I think it was very good for me to read before the book test.
I liked a lot of things in this book, but I also noticed that there are many suggestions for students but there is nothing in this book for parents and teachers.
So, see, my young friends also have this confidence that if they talk about any work to the country's leading servants then it will happen.
My little student friend, I thank you for writing the letter first.
Thank you for reading Ekzam Warriors twice.
If I can take time for a new edition, I will definitely try to write something for parents and teachers like you.
But I'll put an appeal to you all.
Can you help me
I'm gonna take care of them.
I will think about it and I will definitely try to write some of them in my own language, in my own way.
And if your advice comes in large numbers, then it will be sure of my new edition.
So I'll wait for your opinion.
I once again thank our young student friend Arunachal Alina Tayong.
My dear countrymen, through news papers, through television, you know about the busy programmes of the Prime Minister of the country.
But you know that I too am a common man like you.
I've heard that statement and I've seen the match.
The sympathy and transformation of the 23-year-old Daniel Medabhadev is like affecting everyone.
I've been impressed.
Just a while ago, he won the Grandslam 19 times and was defeated by Tennel's Ladgend Rafael Nadal.
Someone else would be sorry and disappointed in that situation.
He complimented his sportsman Spirit for losing his footsteps in the aftermath of a tough fight.
On the other hand, Champion Nadal also complimented Daniel for the game.
The sportsperson's morale and the winner's beneficial use in the same match are both academic.
If you don't listen to the speech of Daniel Medbhedev, I will urge all of you, especially the youth to see that video.
It's all the ages and people in every situation to learn a lot.
There are moments that are above defeat, and these moments do not mean defeat.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, what I'm going to say is for you only.
Discussions will continue, but the problem should be solved before the issue is discovered.
Otherwise, the problem takes a bigger and solving it becomes a toxic thing.
If we are conscious at the beginning, we can save a lot.
From this point of view, I feel that my young friends must say something about an important thing.
We all know how harmful tobacco addiction is for health and once it becomes a habit, it is difficult to quit it.
Tobacco addiction.
In adolescence, the development of the brain is also damaged by the consumption of this tobacco.
All of us know about these things, but today I want to tell you about a new thing.
You know, recently a prohibition has been issued on India-cigarette.
E-cigarette is an electric device different from normal cigarettes.
In e-cigarette, a kind of chemical smoke is produced by heating nicotine substances, through which nicotine enters the body.
We know about the danger of common cigarettes, but there is a confusion about e-cigarette that it is not harmful.
Aromatic chemicals are used to not smell like ordinary cigarettes.
We have seen that even in a family, he tried to smoke his father so that no one else smokes the family.
Small cigarettes of Chanwadi, keep them away from the beed.
There is no fury about cigarettes, those who are selling, buying or watching, they all know that cigarette is harmful.
But the e-cigarette thing is quite different.
There are very little awareness about this.
The common man is not aware of the harmful aspects of e-cigarette and this is the reason why the transparent-cigarette has entered the house.
For a long time, children are showing magic games in front of their mothers and fathers, without fire, without fire, without fire, without smoke, they say they have e-cigarette and they give a big handback.
You know, when somebody's eating cigarettes around us, we can understand it with smell.
Even the packets of cigarettes in the pocket can be understood through smell.
However, e-cigarettes don't happen. Young people know, know, know, don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know, don't fashion, don't roam around in their bags, in the middle of the books or in the middle of the books.
Youth power is the future of our country.
E-cigarette obstacles have been imposed so that these new instruments of intoxication do not deny our country, do not destroy the dreams of the family, do not destroy the lives of the children.
Somehow this intoxication cannot be linked to the society.
I urge you all to quit tobacco and stop nurturing any misconception about e-cigarette.
You must remember Fit India.
Fit India is not just going to Jim everyday morning and evening.
The name of saving from these misleading ideas is 'Fit India'.
I believe, I don't think you're gonna be bad, but it's gonna be good.
My dear brothers and sisters, It is a matter of great privilege for us that India is the birthplace and workplace of all those great personalities who have dedicated their lives not for themselves but for others.
Our India, our land is a multi-ratna basindra.
This country has gifted many human jewellery.
One such humanity is going to be honoured on October 13 in Vatican City, which is a matter of pride for the entire country.
On that day Pope Francis is going to announce Marium Thresia a cent.
Sister Maryam Threasia has made an unparalleled contribution to human welfare in the shortest age of 50 years.
Once again I pay my homage to Sister Maryam Thresia and congratulate the Indians, especially my younger brothers and sisters for this success.
My dear countrymen, it is a matter of pride for not only India but also for the entire world that today when we are going to celebrate Gandhi 150 and at the same time 130 crore Indians have taken a pledge to completely stop the use of single use plastic.
The world's vision is now on India in the way India has played a leading role in environmental conservation.
I am confident that on October 2, the Single Use Plastic-2018 campaign will be attended by all of you.
People are contributing to this campaign in their own way at various places.
However, a youngster of our country has started a unique campaign.
His work attracts my vision and I talk to him on a phone and try to know about his new plans.
Perhaps these things will help other people of the country.
When I heard the plogging word for the first time, it was new to me.
Perhaps this word is used in foreign countries.
Modi ji: Hello Ripodaman ji, I am Narendra Modi.
We will not only take care of our health but also protect the health of the world's mother.
I believe that if 130 crore Indians move together, then our country will take 130 crore steps to build a single useful plastic free India.
Ripu Daman ji, thank you once again
My dear countrymen, on October 2, preparations are going on across the country and around the world, but we want to take Gandhi to the path of 150.
I want to contribute my life to the welfare of the country.
This is our dream of Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat and that is why on 31st October every year we organise a run for unity in the entire country.
My dear countrymen, you might remember that on 15th August I had said from the Red Fort that by 2022, you people visited 15 places of India.
Go to at least 15 places and go there and try to stay at night.
Look at India, understand, feel.
We have so many diversities.
On the occasion of Deepawali, everybody goes to roam, so I request you to visit 15 places in India.
You will be happy to know that India has improved a lot in the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index and it has been possible due to your cooperation.
This has been possible due to the importance of travelling.
That is, we have moved a lot in this time and if we try more then we can take one place in the tourism sector in the world before the completion of 75 years of independence.
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of this diverse India festival.
It must be seen that in the days of Deepawali, there is no fire or loss of any person.
Once again, my best wishes.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2017
My dear countrymen, greet all of you
Mann Ki Baat, October 2017
Six days after Deepawali, the Mahaparab Chat is one of the most regulated festivals in our country.
From food to clothing, everything is celebrated with tradition.
Chhat Puja is completely connected with the unparalleled nature and the worship of nature.
On the one hand, the sun and water, the centres of worship of the Mahaparabhatta, the utensils and roots made of bamboo and soil, the common items related to its worship.
It also contains the significance of cleanliness in our life.
Before the sixth day, the safai of the whole house, along with the rivers, ponds, nearby Khankhand, the puja place, the valley, the safai and the enthusiastic zeal of the people gathered together.
Surya Vandana or Chhat Puja - Conservation of Environment, Prevention of Disease and Discipline.
Besides this pattern of food, it is also mentioned that the ego is destroyed and the ego is an obstacle in the path of progress of a person.
It is very natural to be proud of this great tradition of India.
But when I look at the impact of Mann Ki Baat, I believe that Mann Ki Baat has been tied up with the people of the country.
Take examples of khadi and handlooms.
You must be happy to hear that the only store of Khadi and Handloom was sold so much.
During Diwali, the sale of Khadi Gift Kupan has increased by six hundred and eighty percent.
A total of Khadi and handicrafts has also increased by about ninety percent this year as compared to last year.
It is seen that today the youth, the elderly, the women and the people of every age group like mankind and handlooms.
I can imagine how much the families, the poor families, the families of those working in the handlooms have benefited.
And we had spoken of Khadi for Fashion but in the last few years, I can say that Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion are now taking the place for transformation.
In the life of the poorest of the poor, the handloom has become a powerful tool to empower the poorest of the poor.
Gramoda is playing a very big role.
Shri Rajan Bhatt wrote in the Narendra Modi App that he would like to know about the experience of Deepawali with the Defence Forces and he would also like to know how the Defence Force carried out Diwali.
Mr. Tejas Kazhawad also wrote the Narendra Modi App: What is the arrangement for our homes to reach the defence forces
We also think of our brave defence forces.
We also believe that the sweets of our house should reach the soldiers of the country.
You must have spent Deepawali in a very joyous way.
Deepawali has brought me a special experience this time.
Once again, I am fortunate to celebrate Diwali with our brave defence forces.
This time, I am unforgettable to celebrate Diwali with the Defence Forces in the Gurez sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I respect every soldier of our defence forces for the struggle, dedication and sacrifice that our defence forces have protected the country by confronting the difficult situation in the border.
Whenever we get the opportunity, whenever we get the opportunity, we should know the experiences of our soldiers, we should listen to their pride.
Many of us do not know that the soldiers of our defence forces are playing an important role in establishing peace not only in the borders but in the entire world.
As the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, they are brightening India all over the world.
A few days ago, on 24th October, the UND, UND, was celebrated all over the world.
Everyone remembers the efforts of the United Nations in establishing peace in the world.
And we follow Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam that is, the whole world is our family.
And for this belief, India has been actively contributing to various UN initiatives since the beginning.
You must be aware that the proposals of the Constitution of India and the proposals of the UN Charter begin with the words of 'White The People'.
India has always emphasized the equal rights of women and is a living example of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
It was proposed in the early years that was All Man and Burn Free and Equial, which was transformed into the efforts of India's representative Hunsa Mehta and is later Alhuman Beings and Burn Free and Equival.
Well, it looks a very small change, but we have a healthy philosophy.
The most important contribution that India has made in the UN Amberler is Indias role in UN peacekeeping efforts.
India has always played a major role in the United Nations Peace-Education Mission.
There are many of you who might know this for the first time.
Over eighteen thousand members of the Defence Force have contributed to UN peacekeeping efforts.
Currently, India is attached to the United Nations Peacekeeping Intervention and is the third largest in the world.
By August 2017, about 50 people have contributed to the 77 peacekeeping efforts of the world.
These efforts are being made in various parts of the world like Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon and Sudan.
In Congo and South Sudan, more than 20,000 patients have been treated and rescued in the Indian Army Hospital.
The defence forces of India have not only protected the people of different countries but have also contributed to peacekeeping efforts.
Indian women have played a leading role in the peace process.
Very few people know that India is the only country in Liberia to send women police units to the United Nations Peace Abhiyan.
And see, this step of India has been inspired to all the countries since then.
Since then, all the countries started sending their women police units.
You will be proud to hear that Indias role is not only confined to peacekeeping but also to train the peacekeeping forces of 85 countries.
From this soil of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Buddha, our brave peacekeepers are conveying the message of peace and harmony throughout the world.
Peacekeeping campaign is not very uncomfortable.
Our security forces have to go to every inaccessible area.
They have to understand different situations and different cultures.
Remembering him, the hearts of all the nations are proud.
He was the only member of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force - the brave man who was honored with Paramveer Chakra.
Lt General Premchand ji was one of the Indian Peacekeeping Forces, who also received special recognition of his work in Cyprus.
At the age of 72, he was appointed Army Commander in the campaign of Namibia and served to ensure the freedom of Namibia.
The former Chief of the Indian Army, Thimaiah, led the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and conveyed all his souls to peace.
India is always the messenger of peace, unity and harmony in the world.
May our belief, live a peaceful and harmonious life and move towards building a better and peaceful future.
My dear countrymen, our sacred land is decorated with all the great personalities of India who have served humanity in selflessness.
Sister Nivedita, whoever we live, is known as Bhagwan Nivedita, is also one of these great personalities.
Margaret Elizabeth was born in Ireland and later called Swami Vivekananda Nivedita.
The meaning of Nivedita is that which is completely dedicated.
Later, he showed his name a supreme glory.
Yesterday, Sister Nivedita was 150th birth anniversary.
He was so impressed by Swami Vivekananda that he sacrificed his life for the poor and the poor.
Sister Nivedita, attached to the British Raj's atrocities.
The British tried to compel Indians not only to be physically but also to be psychologically slavery and slavery.
There was always an attempt to make our culture bottom and unprecedented.
Bhagwani Nivedita established the pride of Indian culture.
Inspired by national consciousness, awakening, helping people unite.
He visited various countries of the world and became a witness against the propaganda of Sanatan Dharma and philosophy.
Famous nationalist Tamil poet Subrahmanya Bharati will be renowned for his revolutionary poem Pudumai Penn, NewWomen and Nari Shaktikaran.
It is said that this was the source of inspiration for Lord Nivedita.
The great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose had also helped him in various ways.
Through his writings and conventions, Shri Basu has helped both publication and publication of examinations and publicity.
This is a wonderful co-existence of our India where the spirituality and science of our culture are sufficient to each other.
Sister Nivedita and Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose.
In 1899, in the Calcutta Metropolitan city, the sight of the fatal plague was cast into the lap of death.
Sister Nivedita, by ignoring her health, has come forward in Rastaghat, Narmada Safai Abhiyan.
This is the lady who gave up the poor and the poor for the sake of distress and distresses.
The resting place here is Sister Nivedita, who has given her everything to India.
Undoubtedly, the universal truth.
This will be our tribute to this great personality - if every Indian learns from his life and follows the path of his displayed service.
Thank you for your phone.
First of all, I convey my best wishes to our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on the occasion of his birth anniversary.
Children are the most important part of the construction of a New India, the hero of the next day.
Your anxiety is that all the diseases that have been seen in old age have been seen in the world today.
It's surprising to hear that even children are victims of diabetes today.
But now our lifestyle has changed a lot.
Today, these diseases are called Lifestyledisorder.
The main reason behind these diseases in young age is the deficiency of physical labor and change in food habits.
Both the society and the families need to pay attention to this.
There will be no unnatural or serious changes in this regard.
The need is to pay attention to small things and make them under their own habits.
I want the people of the family to make them sports habits in the open field.
If possible, the elders of the family will also take part with them.
Children should be used to use stairs to change the lift.
After dinner, let's go to the whole family with the kids.
India- Yoga will help our youth to create a healthy lifestyle and avoid lifestyle disorder.
Yoga is simple because Yoga can be learned only.
There is no need for any specific equipment or fields.
A lot of tests are being carried out in this regard that Yoga is effective in controlling diabetes.
A lot of work is being done in AIIMS and the results that have been achieved so far are very optimistic.
Ayurveda and Yoga should not only be considered the way of disease free but should also be a part of daily life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, have been happy for the past few days since the world of sports.
Like Hockey, there is also a pleasure for India.
Badminton Star Kidambi Srikanth won the wonderful Games Mark Open and made every Indian proud.
This is his third superficial victory after the Indonesian Open and Australian Open.
I congratulate this young sportsperson for his success and for Indias proudness.
Friends, FI FA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month itself.
The teams of different countries of the world have come to India to participate in this event and have enjoyed their sports skills.
I had a chance to see a match.
The audience from the player was very enthusiastic.
The world cup is a big event, where the world's eyes are on you.
I was astonished by the enthusiasm, swelling and zeal of the young sportspersons.
The World Cup has been successfully organised and all teams have shown their best skills.
Even if India cannot win the game, India's sportspersons have won the hearts of everyone.
India and the entire world have enjoyed this festival and the entire football tournament was very entertaining for football lovers.
Football's future is very bright and its prediction is being obtained.
Once again I congratulate all the sportspersons, their colleagues and all the sports lovers.
My dear countrymen, if I have to inform all those whom I have to talk about Swachh Bharat, then I will have to celebrate Mann Ki Baat every day and everybody will have to discuss this cleanliness.
Something is about the success of the youngsters' team efforts in the pictures of small children.
Innovation happens at some places with sanitation. Now the zeal towards the work of an officer becomes new.
A few days ago, I got a bigger port, where the revival of Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra is mentioned.
The entire team of NGO, called Ecological Protection Organization, was conducting sanitation campaign at Chandrapur Fort.
They've sent me two pictures before and after the safai.
I am surprised to see and I feel that those who have been desperate to see the filth and filthy environment around, they can see the pictures of the Chandrapur Fort and I will tell them how the labour, determination, jeed and livelihood of the youngsters of the Ecological Protection Organization has been reflected.
Looking at them, your disappointment, unbelief will go away.
This Bhagirath Abhiyan for Swachhta is a unique example of beauty, commitment and sustainability.
The fort is a symbol of our heritage.
Historical resource security and conservation are the responsibility of all the nations.
I thank all the employees of the Ecological Protection Organization and all the members of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, on 4th November, we will celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.
Guru Nanakshudu is not the first Guru of the Sikh community, he is Jagadguru.
He thought of the welfare of the entire humanity and gave the same word to all the nations and communities.
The spirit of women has emphasized on respect and empowerment.
Guru Nanak Dev had travelled 28,000 kilometers and spread the message of humanity in this journey.
He has joined people, guided them to be honesty, sacrifice and dedication.
He didn't just say anything in his mouth, he had done it in his life and his work.
He started the Langarkhana and served the people.
Together, eating food in Langar is awakened with unity and equality.
Guru Nanak has spoken of the three modes of economic life, the name of God, the work of labour and help the distressed.
Guru Nanak also created Guruvani for his speeches.
The 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak will be celebrated in 2019.
Come on, we try to move ahead with their speeches and teachings.
My dear countrymen, two days later on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel will be celebrated.
We all know that he had created the plan of modern India.
We can learn a lot from the life of this great son of Mother India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had worked as an integral part of India.
Millions of Indians have been ensured in the shadow of One Nation, One Constitution.
His observation gave him the power to cross all the obstacles.
He has set a goal and has moved ahead with that goal in the whole day.
He used to say, "One can do the work of connecting the country in a way, who dreams of a nation where everyone has equal rights."
I want this speech of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to inspire us forever.
He said that we cannot change the diversity of the nation and the community, every woman and men of India should determine the future of their country with love and mutual love and harmony.
The words of Sardar Saheb are still inspired by our New India vision.
And that is why his birthday will be celebrated as National Integration Day.
The contribution of making our country an integral form is unforgettable.
Run for Unity will be organized across the country on 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, where children, women, youth and youngsters will be included.
I urge you all to participate in the Run for Unity.
My dear countrymen, after the holiday of Diwali, you have returned to your daily life with a new resolution and a new commitment.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for fulfilling their dreams.
Mann Ki Baat, September 2017
Three years have been completed in doing Mann Ki Baat through Akashwani.
Today is the 36th phase.
Maximum encouraging me.
And I take half an hour for you once a month, but people start talking about Mann Ki Baat for thirty days.
And that is why the sensitivity of the government and the sensitivity of the society is being created.
And that is why this three-year journey of Mann Ki Baat is a journey of the countrymen and their thoughts and feelings.
And perhaps I am very grateful to the people of the country for the opportunity to know the feelings of the common man in such a short span of time.
In Mann Ki Baat, I often remember that Acharya Binoba thought.
Acharya was often unemployed, unemployed, effective.
I believe that three years later, sociologists, universities, researchers, media experts will definitely analyze this.
I believe that this analysis will be very beneficial for Mann Ki Baat in the future, there will be a new consciousness and new entrepreneurship.
And once I had said in Mann Ki Baat, we should think of eating as much as possible, we will not destroy it.
But then I have seen that there have been so many letters from every corner of the country, many social organisations and many youngsters have been doing this thing long ago.
And then I have seen how many people have come forward to do this kind of work for cleanliness.
Once I saw the Selfie with Dotter of a Panchayat chief in Haryana and I put it in front of everyone in Mann Ki Baat.
Not only in India but also in the entire world, the Selfie with Dotter has started a big campaign.
A few days ago, I was sitting with the tourism department of the Government of India.
Please send photographs where you went to Incredible India.
Millions of pictures from every corner of India have become one of the richest resources of those who work in tourism.
I have experienced how small incidents have created a big movement in Mann Ki Baat.
Today's wish, because when I think it's been three years, how many events have come up in my mind for the last three years.
The country is moving forward every moment to go on the right path.
Every citizen of the country wants to do something or the other for the betterment of the society and for the betterment of the country.
During my three-year visit to Mann Ki Baat, I know it from the countrymen, I understand it, I learn it.
For any country, this is a strong wealth, a strong power.
And I have seen that there has been a lot of attraction towards Edening Khadi and I have naturally said that no one has to read Khadi.
But there's a lot of fabric, why isn't it Khadi
The house can be sheets, rooms, curtains, and it seems that the youth have increased attraction towards Khadi.
The sale of Khadi has increased and it has created a direct connection with the employment of the poor.
On 2nd October, Khadi was released and a lot of discounts were received.
Once again, I will say that the campaign for Khadi is going on, we will take it forward and increase it.
We are working with this idea of lighting Diwali in the house of the poor by buying khadis.
The poor of our country will get a strength from this work and we should do it.
And in order to increase interest in this Khadi, the people of Khadi sector and the people associated with the Khadi government of India have been encouraged to think in a new way.
How to bring new technologies, how to increase manufacturing capacity, how to bring solar power and handloom
The old heritage that had been closed for nearly 20, 25, 30 years can be revived.
A Khadi Ashram in Sevapur, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh had been closed for 26 years but today it has been revived.
Several methods have been linked.
Several people have created new employment opportunities.
The Khadi and Village Entrepreneurship Training Centre, which is closed in Pumpore, Kashmir, has a lot to be provided to Kashmir.
Now, in order to resume this training centre, new generations have been helping in modernising, making new things and I am happy that the gifts given to big corporate houses during Deepawali have started giving them goods to Khadi.
People are giving each other a gift to Khadi.
We all feel the way things are moving.
My dear countrymen, in the last month, we all resolved together in Mann Ki Baat and we decided that on the first 15 days of Gandhi Jayanti, we will celebrate Swachhta Festival across the country.
I will connect people with cleanliness.
In our respect, the President has started this work and the country is associated with it.
Everyone has become a part of the Swachhta Abhiyan today.
When I talk about the pledge of pledge, we can see how our Swachhta Abhiyan is moving towards the path of pledge.
I'm gonna see some people's working to apply.
This time we saw one more thing - first we might clean one place, secondly we might be aware that we will not waste any place but if we have to make cleanliness a habit then there is a need for a revolutionary change in our thinking.
This time a lot of competitions were organized in the Swachhta Hi Seva campaign.
More than two and a half crore children participated in the Swachhta event.
Thousands of children have painted.
They have photographed their own imaginations on cleanliness.
Whenever cleanliness comes, I never forgot to express my gratitude to the people of the media.
We have seen how much electronic media and print media can serve the country in the Swachhta Hi Seva movement.
Recently, a few days ago, somebody attracted my attention to the 18-year-old Bilal Dar of Srinagar.
Since the age of 12-13, Bilal has been working with cleanliness for the last 5-6 years.
The largest lake in Asia near Srinagar also cleanses plastic, polythene, used bottles and wastes.
I am glad that the municipality has not only made Bilal a brand ambassador, they have given Bilal a car, uniform and Bilal has also been educating people from other areas and inspiring them to get the desired results.
Bilal Dar is inspiring to those who are interested in small but cleanliness.
I congratulate Bilal Dar.
My dear countrymen, we must acknowledge that the history of the future is born in the pregnancy of history and when we talk about history, it is natural to remember the great men.
The month of October is a month to remember many of our great men.
From Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Patel was born in the month of October this year, who led us in the 20th and 21st century, showed us the path to walk and those who have suffered a lot for the country.
When former President of India, Shriman Abdul Kalam ji spoke to the youth, he was often talking about the rural development of Nanaji Deshmukh.
He spoke of the programme in deep intimately and went to the village to showcase this work of Nanaji himself.
Remembering these great men, we recall them that there is no benefit to them, so that they can find ways to move forward so that there is a right direction for the future.
In the next Mann Ki Baat, I will definitely talk about Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
We are very simple to say: India is the specialty of unity between diversity.
Whether we are proud of diversity or the diversity that we are proud of, do we ever try to feel that diversity
I want to tell all my countrymen in Hindustan again and again, especially to my younger generation that we are in a state of awareness.
You should feel the separation of this India, touch it, gain the pride of it.
This diversity of our country should play a big role in the development of your inner personality.
You go abroad, I don't have any objection, but sometimes you'll see your home
The people of North India don't know what is in South India
The people of West India don't know what is in Eastern India
Our country is full of diversity.
When Mahatma Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda, our former President Abdul Kalam ji had visited India, there was a new inspiration for the country to see, to understand and to save the country.
These great men have seen this country in a broad way.
At the beginning of their work, they tried to know and understand India.
We have tried to make India self-reliant.
Whether we cannot even learn the rules of different states, different communities or communities of our country, their traditions, their dresses, their dresses, their foods, to learn and understand, to earn their livelihood
The value addition in tourism will happen only when we are not only audience but also a student to accept, understand and appreciate the characteristics of those places.
I have got the opportunity to go to more than 500 districts of my own Hindustan.
It was also experienced to live in more than four and a half districts.
Today, when I am taking this important responsibility of the country, the experience of this visit is very useful for me.
That's why I've got a lot of things to understand.
I urge you people to see the unity in diversity in this vast India not only as a slogan but also accomplish this treasure of our superpower.
If a new diet is eaten every day for the entire life, it will not be repeated.
This is the great strength of our tourism.
I want you all to go out of the house and go out for a bit of change on this holiday.
Your worries will be greater.
What's the greater teacher than the availability
Normally, from October to March, the time for tourism is enhanced.
If you meet the people there, send them pictures.
Learn not only the architecture or the architecture, but also the beauty of the people there.
Send yourself to MyGov and send it to the Narendra Modi App.
I have seen one thing that for the development of the tourism industry of India, if you can be the seven best tourist destinations of your own state, every Indian should know about these seven things of your state.
If possible, we'll have to go to those seven places.
Can you give any information about this
You see, if all of them send these information to the same state, then I will tell the government to scrutinize them, and to make publicity about what seven common issues have come from every state.
This means how to improve the tourist destination from the inspiration of a person.
Similarly, if you have seen the seven things you have loved in the whole country, you would like to see someone else or someone else, you should know about it, then you must send the names of seven such places to MyGov, NarendraModiApp.
The Government of India will work on it.
The government will consider making films, making video, producing broadcast literature, making surveillance and making surveillance with the best sightseeing places.
Come on, join me.
You can also be a big driver in the development of tourism during the month of October to March.
I invite you.
My dear countrymen, to be a human being, to touch my mind, to save my mind.
I've had a deep impact on my mind.
Because I'm a man like you.
A few days ago, perhaps you might have seen a wonderful example of women's power and patriotism.
Indian Army Lt. Swati and Nidhi have received two brave men, who are brave.
This is a wonderful reason that freedom and funds were martyred in serving Mother India.
We can think that if the world is destructive at this young age, what will happen to the mind
But the martyr Colonel Santosh Mahadik's wife Swati Mahadik has taken this decision by fighting this difficult situation and has joined the Indian Army.
He worked hard for 11 months and dedicated his life to fulfill the dream of his husband.
Likewise, Nidhi Dubey, his husband Mukesh Dubey worked as a hero in the army and when he was martyred for his motherland, his wife took a decision in mind and he was also admitted to the army.
It is very natural to show respect to our countrymen on this strength of women and our valour.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to these two sisters.
They have created a new inspiration and a new consciousness for crores of people of the country.
Many congratulations to the two sisters.
My dear countrymen, this time between the festivals of Navratri and Deepawali is a great opportunity for our younger generation.
The World Cup of FI FA Under-17 is here.
I believe the football will be heard all around.
Every generation will be attracted to football.
There will be no school-college fields in India where our youth will not be able to play footballs.
Come, when the whole world is coming to play on the soil of India, we have also made this game a part of our lives.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri is going on.
At the time of Mother Durga's feeling.
The entire environment is filled with a pleasant smell.
On the auspicious occasion of Navratri, I congratulate the countrymen, pray to Mata Shakti, let our country reach new heights of success to fulfil the aspirations and aspirations of the common man of the country.
We should come to the country to tackle every challenge.
We have started a five-year road map to fulfil the dreams of the freedom fighters in 2022, the resolve of 125 crore people, the commitment of our countrymen, the commitment of many men and resolves.
My best wishes to all of you.
Celebrate the festivals, brighten the enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2017
My dear countrymen, sadar namaskar
Our country is the country of Buddha and Gandhi, the country of Sardar Patel, who is dedicated to the unity of the country.
Since ancient times, our ancestors have inspired the common values of non-violence and harmony that are associated with our lives.
It is said that Ahimsa Param Dharma, we are listening to it from 1947.
I had also said from the Red Fort, violence will not be defeated in the name of faith, it can be communal belief, faith in political thinking or if any person believes in any tradition or violence will not be defeated in any case.
Nobody has the right to take the law in the name of faith.
Dr.
Babasaheb Ambedkar has ensured that every person has the right to get justice.
I want to assure the people of the country, against those who have taken the law, who goes through violence, whoever is individual or community, the government or the country will not blame anybody.
Everyone has to face the law, the law will judge him and the culprit will have to be punished.
Even our festivals are rich in diversity.
Many of our festivals are directly linked to the farmers and the fishermen brothers and sisters.
Today, I am talking about the festival, so first of all, I want to tell you "Michchami Dukkadam".
Yesterday, the 'Sambasari' festival of the Jain community was celebrated.
During the month of Bhadra in the Jain society, the festival of Poshan is celebrated.
The festival of Samavastri is a symbol of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship.
And it is also called the 'Khama-Vani' festival and on this day there is a tradition of congratulating each other as 'Michami Dukkadam'.
Besides, our scriptures contain the adornment of 'Khama Veerasya Bhushanam'.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Chaturthi is being celebrated everywhere in India with great enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
And when we talk about Ganesh Chaturthi, the issue of public festivals comes in a natural way.
This great festival of Ganesh Chaturthi is going on for 10 days.
And we know this festival as a symbol of unity, equality and sanctity.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to every countrymen on the occasion of Ganesh festival.
Now the ONAM festival is being celebrated in Kerala.
Onam is one of the most important festivals of Kerala in India.
This festival is famous for its social and cultural importance.
The Onam Festival reminds of Kerala's rich cultural heritage.
And now this festival has also become a center of attraction for tourism.
Besides, I will tell the countrymen that the festival of Navratri or the festival of West Bengal has become the main attraction of tourism today.
There is a lot of opportunity to attract foreigners in other festivals of our country.
In this idea, what steps can we take in the coming days - we have to think about it.
Id-ul-Juha will be attended by a few days later.
My best wishes and good wishes to all the countrymen on the occasion of Id-ul-uha.
Festivals and cleanliness are integral in our family life.
The preparation of the festival begins through cleanliness.
It is not new but it is very important to make cleanliness a social habit.
Cleanliness in the public is not only in our houses, in every village, in every city, in our states and in our country, this cleanliness and festival will have to be tied in a cotton that will be incomplete.
My dear countrymen, the language of becoming modern is changing.
Nowadays this new dimension has become a new parameter.
You will be able to see in YouTube. Nowadays children are building a statue of Ganesh with dust at home.
Three years ago, the Swachhta Abhiyan that we started was the third year of 2nd October.
At this time, the officers of Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind in Dhanera, Banasakantha district of Gujarat have taken over the work of flood-affected 22 temples and sanitation of 3 mosques.
If this effort of dedicated cleanliness becomes a permanent part of our nature then where can our country reach
My dear countrymen, I urge you all to come again, once again, on 2nd October, we started the campaign of Swachhta Hi Seva on 15-20 days before Gandhi Jayanti.
Create a cleaner environment throughout the country.
And whenever we get the opportunity, we should find and use the opportunity.
Labour donate.
Come together on holidays or Sundays.
Go to the nearby habitations, go to the nearby villages, give it the form of a movement.
I appeal to all the NGOs, schools, colleges, socio-cultural-political leaders, government Amlas, Collectors and Panchayat heads, on 2nd October, 15 days before the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, create a clean environment so that the India of Gandhijis dreams can be fulfilled.
Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Mygov.
In-a department has been created where after the construction of toilets, you can list your name and the name of the family you have helped in this work.
My social media friends can drive creative campaigns in the virtual world which can actually be inspiring.
The Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation can organise the Swachh Sankalp to Swachh Siddhi Abhiyan under the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation.
You can write in different languages and there is no specific age limit for this competition.
Out of the participants, three will be selected and awarded at the district level and three at the state level.
I urge you all to participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
Definitely take some steps for cleanliness.
Millions of audience and millions of people sometimes send messages, sometimes send messages and send messages that I have a supreme achievement and rare resources.
This is a great opportunity for me to know the thoughts and feelings of the people of the country.
The more you wait for the Mann Ki Baat programme, I am waiting for your news.
I wait very much because I can learn a lot from you.
I try to see, listen, read and know your opinion as much as possible.
"Prime Minister, I am supposed to say Aparna from Pune.
I want to tell you about one of my friends.
He's always trying to help people, but he's got a madness that I'm surprised to see.
I fucked up with him to buy it once.
I saw he bought a sari of Rs. 2,000 and spent Rs. 450 for Pitja.
And to go to Mall, he spent a long time with Autowala for five rupees.
He did the same work while buying vegetables in the way back and saved four-five pieces.
I was so bad.
We spend a lot of money free of cost in big shops, but how much money do we bag with our labourer brothers and sisters, and disbelieve them
I believe that after listening to the news of this phone, you are not only aware, you have decided not to make such a mistake.
You don't think that whenever someone comes around our house to sell things, ferry things, some small shopkeepers, vegetable sellers, sometimes we need auto-rickshaws, whenever we work with a honourable person, we are drunk, we are drunk, we are drunk, we are drunk, we are drunk, we are drunk and we are drunk.
And when people like us go to eat food in a big restaurant, don't see what is written in the bill, I'll get the money out immediately.
Not only this, I don't want to buy saris in the bedroom, but if you work with the poor, you don't leave it without getting rid of it.
You don't have any difference in your life for two rupees, five rupees, but you've ever seen how much of this simple behaviour hurts his mind.
Madam, I'm grateful to you, you gave me a message by calling such a heartfelt.
I believe that if my countrymen have a habit of living with the poor then they will certainly be abandoned it.
My dear young friends, on August 29, the entire country celebrates the National Sports Day.
This day is the birthday of the great Hockey sportsperson and the magician Major Dhyan Chand ji.
His contribution to Hockey is unparalleled.
I recall this thing because I want new generations of our country to be associated with sports.
Sports should be part of our life.
If we are the young nations of the world then we should also look at the fields of sports.
Sports means physical fitness, mental alertness, personality enhancment.
It's a wonderful answer to the sports hearts.
The younger generation of our country will come forward in the field of sports and today in the age of computers, I would like to convey that the playing field is more important than the play station.
Please play in computers, but in the fields outside, sometimes show up with footballs.
Perhaps cricket games in computers, but in the open plains, cricket games under the sky are different.
Today the situation is such that the kids start watching cartoon films at the corner of their homes, or the mobile sports, and the mother was screaming when you would go out.
The time changed, he was an age when the mother told the boy when you would come and today it was a situation that Mother had to say, Dad, when would you go out
Young friends, the Ministry of Sports has set up a sports talent search portal to explore talent in the sports and its development, where any children from all over the country have a talent in the field of sports, they can upload their biodata or video.
The Ministry of Sports will train Selected Emerging Players and the Ministry will launch it tomorrow.
The news of happiness for our youth is going to be held in India from 6th to 28th October, 2018.
Twenty-five teams of the world are going to make India their homes.
Come, let us welcome our young guests from the world with the sports festival, enjoy sports and create an environment in the country.
Today, when I am talking about sports, I feel like a sympathetic event last week and I want to share with the countrymen.
I and some of them were born in the lap of the Himalayas, who had never been connected to the sea.
Six such daughters of our country who work in Naveen will inspire all of us.
These six daughters, with a small boat, I-NS Tarini, will be able to cross the sea.
This campaign has been named Navika Sagar Parikrama and they will reach India a few months after the entire world travels.
Sometimes it's in water for forty days.
Sometimes we spend thirty days together in water.
Our brave six daughters in the midst of the waves of the sea, and this is the first event in the world.
There is no Indian who will not be proud of our daughters
I salute the experience of these girls and I have told them to share their feelings with the entire country.
I will also make a different arrangement for their thinking in the Narendra Modi App so that you can read them.
Because, it's a brave idea, it's a matter of your thinking, and I'm glad to bring these girls to you.
My best wishes to these daughters, the blessings of the sword.
My dear countrymen, on September 5, we all celebrate Teachers Day.
The birth anniversary of the former President of our country, Dr. Radhakrishnan Ji.
He was the President, but he made himself a teacher throughout his life.
He always liked to live as a teacher.
He was a dedicated life to education.
The importance of a teacher is to awaken the mindset of creation and enjoy knowledge among his students.
Can I launch a campaign in a mission mode
When there is talk of transformation in our country, just as the mother of the family is remembered, the role of teachers in the society will be remembered.
Teachers have a huge role in transformation.
There is an incident of transformation of some students in every teacher's life and we work in a holistic way.
It will play a big role in the transformation of the country.
Let us move forward with this mantra of 'Tech to Transform'.
My name is Dr. Absolute.
I am associated with the residents of Mumbai and the INDIA Research Centre of Howard University.
This scheme was started with a dream before the 28th year 2014.
Tomorrow, the next three years of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will be completed.
30 crore Indians participated in this scheme and opened their first bank account.
The number of new account holders is more than the population of many countries of the world.
If there is money in the house or in the pocket then it's going to be bad.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the poor people of our country have deposited about 65,000 crore rupees.
Those who have opened the accounts in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, have access to insurance.
Under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, only one and three rupees premium has created new confidence in the lives of the poor.
In many families, when this poor person is in trouble, the chief of the family died, the benefits of a premium will be Rs.
I have been told that the benefits of Jan Dhan Yojana, the Rupay Card, the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the benefits of the common man for insurance have been encouraging.
My dear countrymen, I convey my best wishes to you.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2017
People's mind is such that the rainy season is very pleasant for the people.
Animals and birds, trees and nature everybody blossoms in the rainy season.
But sometimes when the rain takes a terrible form, it can be understood how much the devastating capacity of water is.
Nature is our lifestyle, our sustainable work, but sometimes floods, natural illusions like earthquakes, its terrible form becomes very devastating.
This change in the weather cycle and the change in the environment has a negative impact.
In the last few days, due to heavy rains in some parts of India, especially in Assam, North-East, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Bengal, there is a lot of natural hazards.
The flood affected areas are being monitored.
Rescue work is being carried out widely.
Wherever possible, my colleagues in the Council of Ministers will be reaching.
The State Government is also making every effort to help the flooded people in their own way.
Social organisations, cultural organisations and citizens who want to do service work are making every effort to help the people in this situation.
It has an impact on agriculture, animals, infrastructure, cheaper, electricity and connectivity.
In particular, for the loss of crops and crops to our farmer brothers, we have formulated schemes to ensure that payment insurance companies, particularly agricultural insurance companies can play a positive role so that the claims can be made to the farmers at a rapid pace.
People are talking about their own conditions.
Before the rainy season, the entire government programme was prepared by mock drilling most of the places.
The NDRF team was appointed.
Gradually, we have made us like this that according to the prediction of the rainy season, we will do our work in such a way that we can get relief from losses.
Whenever I am ready for Mann Ki Baat, I see the citizens of my country made more than me.
Now there are so many letters about GST, so many phones have come and people are still expressing happiness about GST, asking questions.
I would like to hear you a phone call: "Namskar Pradhan ji, I am telling you from Gurgaon to Neetu Garg.
I am very impressed to hear your statement on Chartered Accountant Day.
This is the reason why Goods and Service Tax (GST) has been started in our country last month.
I'd like to hear your opinion about this.
Thank you.
The GST is almost a month since its inception and its beneficial results are visible.
And I am very happy that whenever a poor man writes a letter, how the prices of the poor people's useful goods have been reduced to GST, how cheap things have become.
Anyone living in the North-East, far-flung mountainous regions and forests used to write in a letter that it was feared or not, but now when I have learned and understood it, then I feel that the work has become easier from before.
Business has become simple.
And the biggest thing is that the trust of the consumers is increasing.
Now I see the impact of GST on Transportand Logistics Sector.
How the traffic has increased.
As a result, there is a strong smooth transmission, there is a strong migration, there is a new registration and there is a new belief in the country.
And sometimes, economists, managing experts, pundits of technology, through their research, they will definitely bring the use of GST to India as a model for the world.
It will become a Case Study for various universities in the world.
Because such a big change in such a big measurement, the participation of millions of people in it, the use and success of such a large country, this is the top point of success.
The world will definitely research on this.
GST has been implemented, every state has participated in it and every state has its responsibility.
All the decisions were taken together by the States and the Centre.
And as a result, the primary goal of every government is to ensure that there is no pressure on the poor for GST.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Ministries, all the departments, all the Central and State Governments.
GST is an excellent example of Indias overall energy.
It's a historic achievement.
Such a campaign for social reforms.
I once again bow down to crores of people of the country for making such a big endeavour successful.
My dear countrymen, the month of August Movement.
Yusuf Mehr Ali.
What happened on August 9, 1942, our new generation winners.
From 1857 to 1942, how much they had to bear, how much they had to bear, how much they had to unite themselves with the hopes of independence, the leaf of history is inspired to build a better India.
This was the time when every corner of Hindustan, every corner of the city, every corner of the city, every corner of the villages, every corner of the country, every person was involved in the uit India Movement.
In the call of Mahatma Gandhi, lakhs of Indians dedicated their lives to the struggle of Karenge Ya Marenge.
After the call of Mahatma Gandhi on 9th August, after the uit India Movement, the British made all the big leaders jealous and then came forward to take up the movement.
Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan are the second generation leaders.
In the 1920 Abhiyan of Cooperation and the 1942 uit India Movement, Mahatma Gandhi had two different forms.
The face of the non-cooperation movement was similar, then in 42, the rapidity of the movement grew so much that the great men like Mahatma Gandhi had given the mantra of 'Karenge Yamreng'.
This was followed by peoples support, peoples strength, peoples resolve and peoples struggle.
The whole country fought together that day.
I have ever thought that if we gather the leaves of history then we can see that India's first freedom struggle was in 1857.
The war that started in 1857 was going on somewhere in every corner of the country till 1942 and in this long time it gave birth to a strong demand for freedom to the people of the country.
Everybody is committed to do something or the other.
Generations have changed, but the intensity of their commitment is nothing.
A group of people came here, joined the struggle, went away, then a new party came and they joined the struggle in the same way. And the British empire has tried every moment to produce the country.
From 1857 to 1942, this effort brought the movement to the peak in 1942 and the toxin of Bharatchato was so bad that it could go to English in five years in 1947.
From 1857 to 1942, the freedom fighters had come to every country and from 1942 to 1947, the five years of the resolution were due to the success of the country in five decisive years.
These five years were the founder.
Now I want to connect you with this process.
We were free in 1947 and today in 2017.
It's almost 70 years.
The government's here, has gone.
The policy regulations have been created, have changed, have been transformed.
Everyone has done their own work to solve the problem of the country.
Continuous efforts are being made to increase the income of the common man in the country, to eradicate poverty and to develop.
Hope has also increased.
On 15th August 2017, we will observe as the beginning of the Sankalp Parv and when 75 years of independence in 2022, we will certainly achieve the same resolve.
From 1942 to 1947, as the five years of independence were decisive, from 2017 to 2022, the five years of India could be a decisive year for Indias future.
Five years later, we will celebrate 75 years of independence.
A resolution that we will be able to achieve in the next five years.
Come on, use technology and move forward with video posts, blogs, blugs and new ideas.
This movement has to become a mass movement.
uit in India uiz will be organized for young friends in the Narendra Modi App.
This uiz competition is an attempt to introduce the youth of the country to the glorious history of the country and the heroes of the freedom struggle.
I am glad that I had a lot of proposals from every corner of the country to discuss what should be said in the last three years on 15th August and the main objectives of these proposals should be their dreams.
I will try to discuss these proposals as long as I get on 15th August.
I'll finish it in 40-45 or 50 minutes.
My dear countrymen, I want to talk about another thing today.
Socio-economic engagement with the economy of India.
It should never be rubbed.
Our festivals and festivals are not just for joy and joy.
Our festivals, festivals are actually a social reform campaign and every festival connects the economic life of the poorest of the poor to the poor.
After a few days, Rakhi Bandhan, Janmashtami, then in the course of Ganesh Festival, Chauth Chandra, Anant Chaturdashi, Durga Puja, Deepawali etc. will be celebrated.
This festival also enjoys a simple natural pleasure.
In the context of the economy, Rakhi Bandhan Festival has been manufactured by hundreds of families in small family business since the month of Rakhi Bandhan.
Suti, silk, etc. have a variety of cottons, and nowadays people like to keep hommade.
People associated with Rakhi manufacturing, people associated with sales, sweet businesses and hundreds of thousands of businessmen are associated with a festival.
Small soil lamps have been built and they are directly related to the poor families but Deepavali.
Today, when I talk about the economy of festivals, festivals and the poor people associated with it, I also want to talk about the environment.
Sometimes I think that the people of the country are more aware and active than me and I have also achieved it.
Awakening citizens have written a letter to me about the past one month.
They have appealed to me that during this time I should talk about Ganesh on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi so that people like Ganesh, make plans.
Lokmanya Tilak started this great tradition and this year is the 125th anniversary of the Ganesh Festival.
125th year and 125 crore Indians.
Lokmanya Tilak Ganesh Festival was started by keeping in mind the spirit of social unity, awakening society and social reforms.
Come, let us also recall him that this year we are organising competitions, discussions etc. during the Ganesh festival.
Come, let us enjoy this festival with the economy of the poor, let the joy of our festival be the economic festival of the poor, let us enjoy economic joy.
I convey my best wishes to all the countrymen for the coming festivals.
My dear countrymen, we are constantly seeing that be it education, economic sector, social sector or sports, our daughters are brightening the country and reaching the top of new achievements.
Our countrymen are proud of our daughters, we are honoured for them.
Just a few days ago, we have shown excellent skills in the field of women cricket.
This week I had the opportunity to meet all these players.
Their faces had a fucking mark.
I'm telling those girls about a different assessment.
I have seen such a game that if Indian sportspersons are unsuccessful, then the anger of the country is among the sportspersons.
Some people say something like a breakdown, something like that is very painful.
Not all this, the daughters performed her, honored her.
I have seen a nice change in this thing and I have told these girls that you can see this privilege only for you people and remove the success that you have not succeeded.
Whether you win the match or not, you have won the hearts of twenty five crore Indians.
Indeed, the youth of our country, especially our daughters are doing a lot to brighten the name of the country.
My dear countrymen, once again I would like to remind you of the August Movement and once again recall the 9th August.
May every country be pledged to fulfil their pledge for five years.
Come on, we walk together, we do something or the other.
The fate of the country and the future of the country will continue to be better with this belief.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2017
Climate changes.
It was too hot.
However, it is fortunate that the rainy season is following its footprints.
Rainfall has started in some parts of the country.
It feels comfortable in the cold winds after the rains.
We all have seen that the excitement or anxiety of individual life or public life, the arrival of rains changes our mindset.
Today, the chariot journey of Lord Jagannath Dev in different parts of the country is moving with great enthusiasm and joy.
Today, in some other places of the world, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated.
The poor people of the country are particularly associated with Lord Jagannath.
Lord Jagannath is the god of the poor.
Very few people know that there is a word in English language Juggernaut, which means a beautiful chariot whose speed cannot be stopped.
This word has come from Jagannathji's chariot.
This means that the people of the world have acknowledged the importance of this journey of Jagannath in their own way.
My best wishes to all on the occasion of Idol-ul-Fitr.
Come, let us all come together to inspire the country with the inspiration from this festival.
In this month of Ramzan, I learnt about a very inspiring incident in the Mubarakpur village of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh.
In this small village, he lives in thousands of Muslim brothers and sisters, most of the Muslim families here.
In this month of Ramzan, everyone from the village decided to build a toilet together.
17 lakhs have been provided with the assistance provided by the Government to build a personal toilet.
You will be happy to hear and will be surprised to know that in this sacred month of Ramzan, the Muslim brothers and sisters of the state have returned the amount of Rs.
17 lakhs for other services.
I thank all the villagers of Mubarakpur on this auspicious occasion of Ramzan.
Everything of them is inspiring.
The biggest thing is that they have made Mubarakpur a free defecation free place.
We know that three states of our country - Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala have already been declared ODF.
This week, Uttarakhand and Haryana have also been declared Open Defecation Free.
I am particularly grateful to the administration and the people of this five-state state for completing this work.
We are very well aware that we have to work hard to do some good work in a personal life or in a social life.
If my handwriting is bad, I have to make a conscious effort to fix it.
Thus, there is a change in physical and mental condition.
Cleanliness is the same.
Some bad habits have become our habit.
Everybody's got to draw attention.
The inspirational events will also be remembered again.
I am happy that cleanliness is no longer a government programme.
This is taking the form of a mass movement in the society.
When the people associated with the administration take this task forward with the participation of the people, then it normally increases the strength.
I remember a good event in the past that I want to tell you.
This incident is the Vijayanagaram district of Andhra Pradesh.
Their goal was to build 71,000 household toilets in 71 Gram Panchayats in 100 hours.
My dear countrymen, you will be happy to hear that the people and the local administration have successfully completed 10,000 toilets in the last 100 hours.
71,000 villages have become ODF.
In-A, all these suggestions are received through letters.
It is necessary to be aware of democracy and that is why it is necessary to recall the events that hurt democracy and encourage the good wishes for democracy.
On 25th June, 1974, a black day that a democracy lover cannot forget any Indian.
The entire country was transformed into a prison.
The voices of the opponents were ceased.
The dignitaries of the country including Shri Jaiprakash Narayan were captured.
The justice system could not be relieved of the needy situation.
The newspaper was completely unusual.
The students of today's journalists and people working on democracy recall the black day and are constantly striving to enhance awareness towards democracy.
At that time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was also jailed.
Atal ji wrote a poem over the years of emergency and described the mental status of that time in the poem.
We have to strengthen this legacy.
My dear countrymen, every Indian is feeling himself proud to be in the world today.
On 21st June, 2017, the entire world became a participant.
People from the sea to the mountains welcomed the sun rays through Yoga morning and morning.
Is there any Indian who will not be proud of it
It was not like this that Yoga was not practiced before, but today, when Yoga was tied up in the form of Yoga, Yoga has become the cause of the world's integration.
Almost all the countries of the world have taken the occasion of Yoga on their own.
On the one hand, where people have practiced the Great Wall of China, people have practiced Yoga in Peru's World Heritage Site at Machupichhu at a height of 2,400 metres above the sea level.
In France, the IFAL Tower was shadowed by people.
More than four thousand people have joined Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
The India-Afghan Friendship Dam at Herat in Afghanistan has joined the Salma Band and gave India a new gift of friendship.
In a small country like Singapore, there have been seventy-five events and they have started a campaign throughout the week.
The United Nations has released 10 postage stamps on International Day of Yoga.
Headquarters of the United Nations (UNH) have been conducting Yoga Strategies under the aegis of Yoga Specialists.
Employees from the United Nations, Diplomators from all over the world participated in this.
Once again, Yoga has created world records.
In Ahmedabad, Gujarat, about 50,000 people have joined together and created a new world record.
I also have the opportunity to participate in Yoga programmes in Lucknow.
But for the first time I was fortunate to join the rains.
Our soldiers have also practiced Yoga in Siachen where there are twenty, twenty and forty degrees temperatures.
Whether it is our Armed Forces, BS-F, IT-B-P, C-R-P-Fock, CI-S-F, everybody has participated in Yoga along with their duties.
On this Day, I had said that three generations, since this was the third International Day of Yoga, I had said that three generations of the family should join together and share their photographs.
Some TV channels have taken this thing forward.
I got a lot of photographs in this regard, some of them have been composed of photographs and kept in the Narendra Modi app.
A few days ago, I had the opportunity to visit a very dear devotee.
For a few days, the best events in Kerala are being held, the habit of studying among the people in the initiatives of PNPNECKR Foundation, the people are enthusiastic to read books, so that reading day and reading mind are being celebrated.
I had the opportunity to go to the beginning and I was told there that we don't blossom flowers, books.
I'm nice.
This time I remembered the thing that had gone away from the centre of my attention.
Because when I was in Gujarat, I had made a pattern in the government that we would not break it, we would give it or we would welcome it with a roll.
He's gonna be a rubber so that he's gonna be in Khadi's shrine.
As long as I was in Gujarat, this was the habit of everyone, but after coming here, my habit goes away.
But in Kerala, the habit was awakened.
And I've started giving notice to the government again.
We can gradually create a habit.
The age of flower blooming is very low.
Once you have to take it from your hands.
But if you give a book, it becomes a part of the house and becomes a family member.
When I went to London, the queen of Britain, ueen Elizabeth invited me to dinner.
How many years have passed, ueen Elizabeth has taken care of the rules given by Mahatma Gandhi.
And he showed me with great pleasure to go.
When I was watching, I don't know if he wanted me to touch it once.
A small gift of Mahatma Gandhi has become a part of his life and has become a part of his history.
I am confident that these habits don't change at night and sometimes it has to be debated.
However, such things should be highlighted, efforts should be made.
Now I can't tell you that I've gone somewhere and somebody has flowers, then I'll not tell him, I can't do it.
However, there will be discussions, but it should continue, it will change gradually.
My dear countrymen, there is a lot of work in the form of Prime Minister.
I have to drown in the files, but I have made a habit of myself, I have some of the letters that I have received and there is a chance to connect with the common man.
Different kinds of people are written.
I feel like reading such a letter before you.
A daughter-in-law Arulmozhi Servanan, a home-in-law in Tamil Nadu, has written a letter.
What are you writing in that letter - I said, I thought of consolidating my world and doing something to keep children in their studies so that there is a financial solution to the world.
In the same way, I started taking some loans from the bank in the Mudra Yojana and buying some goods from the market.
With this, the government has started a scheme called 'Government e-marketplace'.
So I've been looking for myself to register myself in this system.
Anyone who wants to supply any goods to the government can be electric bulbs, you can want to supply dostbins, sweeps, chairs, tables, whatever you want to sell, you can register.
He wrote, for the first time, I got the Mudra Yojana and started my business and then I registered all my sales goods in E-GEM and then I received the order from the Prime Minister's Office.
I wanted to know what the PMO wanted to buy
He said he bought thermos and got 1600 payments.
Yes, it's Empowerment.
Transparency, empowerment, entrepreneurship is also increasing.
Government-Marketplace-GEM
I want the number of people who want to sell something to the government should be increasing in such a way.
I understand that this is an incredible example of Minimum Government and Maximum Governance and aims at Minimum Price and Maximum Supply, Efficiency and Transparency.
My dear countrymen, on the one hand, as we can proudly proud of Yoga, and as well as the success in the space science.
This is the specialty of India, Yoga has connected the land of our country and is also our country in remote space missions.
Earlier, in sports, India has shown a lot of success in science.
Today, India is not only on earth but also on space.
Two days ago, ISRO has also launched 30 nanosatellites along with Cartosat-II satellites.
These satellites include about 14 countries like France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and America.
And these nano satellites of India will provide a lot of beneficial information about the prediction of natural illness for the benefit of the farmers in the agriculture sector.
A few days ago, we all remember that ISRO has successfully launched GSAT-19.
Just imagine how great our scientists have achieved in space research.
On June 19, the Mars Mission was one thousand days.
You all remember that for this mars mission we had to successfully set up in Orbit and its tenure was fixed for six months.
It was 6 months.
But the extraordinary capabilities of our scientists have crossed a thousand days even after six months.
Our scientific journey to complete this thousand days is leading to great success in our space research.
In addition to studying, our younger generations are brightening their skills and their physical potential in the field of sports.
This is the same day that India's Badminton sportsperson Kidambi in Indonesia and Spain has increased the honour of the country.
I congratulate Srikanth and his coach on this occasion.
T.
Sportspersons play a vital role in development.
Sports plays an important role in the development of the overall personality.
There is no shortage of talent in the country.
If the children and children of the family are swinging towards sports, they should be encouraged.
Once again, the countrymen, the festivals of rainy season and festivals give a unique recognition to this time.
Mann Ki Baat, May 2017
Today, when I talk to you, the holy month of Ramzan has started.
In the holy month of Ramzan, I convey my warm greetings to all the people of the world, especially the Muslim community in this holy month.
During Ramzan, special attention is given to prayer, spirituality and mercy.
We are very fortunate for the Hindus. Our frontiers have created a tradition that Indians can pride.
We can proudly proudly proudly proudly possess the people of the world in India.
This is a country that believes in God or the Nastik who worshipped the idols or those who oppose the idols, all kinds of thoughts, all kinds of worship processes, all kinds of traditional people have earned a strategy to live together.
And be it religion, community, thinking or tradition - whatever it is, gives us the same message - peace, unity and harmony.
This holy month of Ramzan will be helpful in furthering this stream of peace, unity and harmony.
I once again wish you all the best.
Last time, when I used Mann Ki Baat, I used a word, especially the young people said, to do something new, to get out of the comfort zone with a new experience.
And this is the age to live like this - to take a little risk, to be consistent with hardship.
I'm glad many people gave me feedback.
Everyone inspired me to personally talk to me.
There is such a message that I can't read everything, I can't hear the messages sent to everyone.
But I have seen how many things have come in my sight, some are trying to learn songs, some are trying to learn songs, some are trying to learn new things using YouTube, some are trying to learn new languages, some are learning cooking, some are learning dance, some are learning drama, some are writing that they have started writing poems.
My studying habit was almost closed.
That's why I tried to read this holiday.
When I started studying about the freedom struggle, I realized how many struggles have to be fought for India's independence, how many freedom fighters have spent years in jail.
I am inspired by the life of Bhagat Singh, who has done a lot at a very young age.
Therefore, I urge you to say something about it today.
I am glad that today's youngsters are expressing their desire to know about our history, our freedom fighters who have sacrificed their lives for our country.
I went to Andaman Nicobar several years ago.
I went to see the cellular jail.
Today is the birth anniversary of Veer Savarkar.
Veer Savarkar was sitting in jail and wrote the book Manji Janmathe.
I used to write poems on the walls of the prison.
He was locked in a small house.
How hard to bear for freedom.
When I read the book 'Manji Janmathe' of Savarkarji, I was inspired to see the cellular jail.
There's a light and sound show that's very inspiring.
There is no such state in Hindustan, there is no such language language person who has not suffered the punishment of Kalapani for freedom, in Andaman's jail, in this cellular jail.
Whenever you get the opportunity, you will definitely go to the pilgrimage of our freedom struggle.
My dear countrymen, the first Monday of June 5.
And this year the theme of the 1970 Nationals is Connecting People to Nature.
In other words, 'back to Basics'.
And someone else said better than Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi has said several times: "One must care about a world will not see", that is, the world we have not seen, our duty is to think about it, to be careful about it.
After getting tired, the windows of the house open and breathe in the fresh air.
When we contact the Panchbhoota where our body is formed, the Panchbhoota is connected then it is from you that our body has a new life and a new vibration.
We all saw it, but we didn't think about it, we couldn't bind it in a rope.
After that, you will definitely see that whenever you join various natural conditions, you will have a new consciousness within you.
And that is why on 5th June, we should have our own campaigns all over the world to connect with nature.
We find some results of the work that our ancestors have done to protect the environment.
If we protect the environment, our next generation will get its results.
In Vedas, the world and the environment are considered to be the root of energy.
We are here to say Mother Bhoomi, son Aham Prithbia.
The Veda says that the sacredness that we have is for our world.
The earth is our mother and we are his sons.
If we think of Lord Buddha then one thing must come out that the birth of Mahatma Buddha, his knowledge and his Mahaparinirvana were three in the trees.
But we need to connect him with modern dialects.
I've got news from different states this time.
With the rainy season, a big campaign to plant trees in almost all the states has started.
Crores of trees are planted.
As World Yoga Day, the whole world celebrates this day.
In a short span of time, this World Yoga Day on 21st June has been spreading all over the country and people are joining.
On the one hand, many powers that create distinctions in the world are showing its deformity. At this time, the World Yoga Day is Indias biggest contribution.
Through Yoga, we have binded the entire world in one way.
The way Yoga tied the body, mind, intelligence and soul together, today Yoga tied the world together.
In contrast, Yoga plays an important role in providing stress-free life in this situation.
Yoga is not just a exercise but health is blossomed by the combination of body, mind and justice and this combination is possible only through yoga.
Two days ago, I wrote a letter to all the governments and leaders of the world about Yoga Day.
Last year, I had announced some Yoga Competitions and announced some awards.
A funny proposal.
He said, This is the third International Day of Yoga, telling me, I urge the three generations of the same family to exercise together on this third International Day of Yoga.
Whether it is a maternal grandmother or grandmother, mother-father, boy-daughter, three generations of yoga exercise together, and upload the pictures of it.
Yesterday, a fortunate link between today and tomorrow will give a new direction to Yoga.
I thank you for this proposal and I feel that as we have been campaigning with Selfie with Daughter, and have created a pleasant experience, the pictures of Yoga of these three generations will illuminate the entire country and the world.
You must surely send a picture to me through the Narendra Modi App in MyGov where three generations are doing Yoga together.
This will be tomorrow, today and tomorrow's pictures, which will be a beautiful guarantee of time.
I invite you all.
Still around three weeks of International Day of Yoga remains.
Start the habit from today.
You should also propagate about Yoga for three weeks, spread it, join people.
This is the movement of a kind of Proventive Health Care.
I invite all of you to participate in this.
Since then you took charge of me as the Chief Servant, and from the Red Fort I had got the opportunity to keep my first speech on 15th August that day I had told about cleanliness.
From that day to today, I have been visiting different parts of India.
In Modiji, TV and social media today, I have seen that wherever you are going, all the people of the country are paying special attention to cleanliness.
Whether it is Mumbai or Surat, people have accepted Swachhta as a mission in your call.
Children were also aware of cleanliness with the elders.
Many times the youngsters saw them throwing jungles to the elders.
The cleanliness that you have started from Kashi Ghat has taken the face of a movement through your inspiration.
You are right, wherever I am going, the work of sanitation is done by the government, but today a festival of cleanliness starts in the society.
But when this phone call came, I thought and saw that yes, it's okay.
The rest of the preparations will be made to welcome the Prime Minister, but at first it will be Swachhta.
It will automatically enjoy any person who loves cleanliness.
I would like to thank everyone for insisting on this cleanliness.
Someone gave me a proposal.
Well, it's a funny proposal.
I don't know if I can do it.
Modi ji , when you go to an invitation , will say , if you invite me then what kind of sanitation will be there , how many tons of jungles you will offer to me , I will decide my visit on that basis .
Dear is very good, but I have to think.
Again, it's right that movement should be done, and as a gift, clean a few tons of jungles instead of other things.
How many people we'll save from illness.
How big humanity will work.
Once I consider it as health, new ways of Waste Management will come forward.
Young people associated with start-ups will come forward with new plans and be the source of new machinery.
The dry waste in these four thousand cities will be blue dustbin-A and wet waste green dustbin.
The waste of the kitchen, such as vegetable peels, peels, eggs open, trees and leaves - these are wet wastes - green dustbins.
If you remember the green color of food in agriculture then you will remember what to do in green dustbin.
And the remaining wastes such as unnecessary papers, iron, card boards, glasses, clothes, plastics, polythenes, rubber and other metallic items - which have to be recycled in machines, which are not usually used in blue dustbin.
I believe that we will be able to create a habit like this, we will have to take new steps for cleanliness and we will be able to fulfil the dreams of Gandhijis cleanliness.
Today, I would like to recall with pride that if a person takes his mind then how big a movement can be created.
Cleanliness is the same thing.
In the past, you must have heard a news and the smelling Barsoba Beach of Mumbai has become a clean, clean Barsoba Beach.
It's not suddenly, a citizen has changed the picture of Barsoba Beach for 80-90 weeks and has made Barsoba Beach clean, clean and beautiful by removing thousands of tonnes of dirt.
And the Versova Residents Volunteer took over it.
A person, Mr. Afroz Shah, was embarrassed with all the powers since October 2015 and gradually many more people joined this work and took the form of a mass movement.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) awarded Afroz Shah for this work.
He was the first Indian who was awarded the Champions of the Arth Award.
I know that the local women have been leading the most in this work.
In order to create awareness among the people, they have taken tools and inspired everyone in every street and every household.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all these mothers and sisters.
I convey my greetings to the officers of Jammu and Kashmir for a beautiful launch by making a Block free from defecation.
My dear countrymen, the work of the present government for the last three years has been continuously discussed in the newspapers and in various TV channels and social media for the last 15 days.
Three years ago, you gave me the charge of chief servant.
People from all walks of life have analyzed it.
This is a good tradition for democracy.
I would like to thank all those people who have given critical and important feedback, who have got the opportunity to improve the misunderstanding, deficiency etc.
For a conscious nation, this debate is important for a conscious nation.
My dear countrymen, that is why a common citizen like me and you have a similar impact in the minds of an ordinary citizen.
There are hundreds of families who have written this to me.
As an ordinary man, it has a special impact on my mind as a common citizen, this incident has inspired me.
I am grateful to Akbar Sahib.
Come on, let us all go ahead with love for nature in this environment.
My best wishes to you all.
Mann Ki Baat, April 2017
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
And the aspirations of the children, the aspirations of the younger generation, the experiences of the elders come forward.
Every time the inputs that come for Mann Ki Baat are analyzed by the government.
What kind of advice, what is the complaint, what kind of feelings of people.
On the motor, people's habit is to give advice to others.
On the train, if someone wants to go to the bus, let's just say that to others.
But when I tried to see these things, I was amazed.
In most cases, those people have sent advice and tried to reach me, who have actually done something in their lives.
They have tried to do some good work in accordance with their intellect, energy, capability and opportunities.
And when I understood that, I thought these suggestions weren't simple.
These are from the fertilizers of experience.
Some people feel that where they are working, wherever they are working, these things are coming up, if others listen to them then they can create a widespread form and it can benefit many people.
Not only this, when I mention something, I remember it and I am very happy.
I have never thought that in our country, especially the youth have been working on this thing for a long time.
For a few years, I knew that some social organisations were working on this issue but I can know that the youth of my country is working on this thing.
Many have sent me a video.
There's a lot of places where the bread bank is running.
People collect bread in the bread bank, deposit the bread, and the poor people who have the bread collect them for themselves.
Those who are giving good things, and those who want don't seem to be small.
It's an example of how it works through cooperation in the society.
It's the last day of April.
On 1st May, he was recognized as Gujarat and Maharashtra.
My best wishes to the people of both the states on this occasion.
Both the states have been making efforts to achieve new goals of development and have been involved in the development of the country.
And in both the states, the arrival of the great men and their lifestyle in every field of society continues to inspire us.
On the occasion of the inauguration of the two states, we should make a pledge to recall the great men of our states, our own country, our society, our cities, our families, that is, 75 years after the independence of 2022.
It should be planned to transform this pledge and to further enhance cooperation for all citizens.
It's time to feel the warmth in our country and in April this time.
When I was consulting people in Mann Ki Baat, I had suggested that what should be done in this heat and that was given to the people.
All these things are prevalent. Nothing is new, but it will be used to remember it again in a special time.
And I have seen that the children of the family are doing this thing very well.
Once they understand why these waters should be filled, they go to see if they have water in the utensils ten times a day.
And the birds are coming or watching them.
I think it's a game, but it's a wonderful way to awaken the condolences of the real boys.
In our country, we live together with animals and birds and birds, colourfully colourfully coloured them, yet we should also emphasize the collective efforts to conserve them.
When I was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Dharmaguru of Daudi Bohra Samaj had completed a hundred years.
He was alive for 103 years.
And to celebrate his hundred years, Bohra has launched a big campaign to save the climbers through the Burhani Foundation.
I had the opportunity to commemorate this campaign.
Almost thousands of bird feeders were spreading them in the corner of the world.
This campaign has been launched at the Guinness Book of World Records.
Sometimes I was so busy that I forgot to give some water before those who came to my house in the summer.
Young friends, I want to talk to you too.
Sometimes I feel that some of our youngsters have enjoyed living in a comfort zone.
Their mother-in-law had administered them in one of the horsetopes.
Some people pass through excitement, but most people spend this life of comfortzone.
Now the test is over and there are several plans to enjoy holidays.
It's very funny when it's hot in the summer.
But I want to talk about how to make your holidays as a friend.
I'm sure some people will work on me and tell me.
Sometimes there is a distinction between watching something on TV, reading or learning about it and feeling itself.
Whether the test is positive, it's like a bit out of the comfortzone.
We are a middle class family, a happy family.
Friends, do you ever feel that you can take a ticket without reservation and sit in the second class room of the train and travel for 24 hours.
Sometimes feel it, I don't tell you to do it again, but do it once.
In the evening, with your football, with volleyball or with other means of sports, the drive to a poor settlement.
Play yourself with those poor boys, you will see, you will feel that this joy of playing in life has never been enjoyed before.
The children who live in the society will have the opportunity to play with you, what do you think will change the lives of those children
This experience will give you a lot of things.
Many voluntary organizations are working on this service.
Sometimes several memorial camps are organised for personality development and many developments can be included in it.
If you are participating in Samar camps, your personality development courses, you should go to the people of the society free of cost who have been deprived of these courses and teach them what you have learned.
How to do these things, you can teach.
We are concerned that technology has come to reduce the distance, but the result is that there are six units in the same house, but the interaction between them has increased so much that is imaginative.
Everyone is busy with new technologies.
Staying together is a reform, unity is power.
Secondly, I want to say with skills, don't you want to learn new things
We all try to make good results, lose ourselves, get filled with some coaching classes in the vacation.
Sometimes it feels scared, our younger generation is not getting robots.
A bit of emphasis can be laid on skill development.
You can try to spend yourself away from technology - somebody learns instruments, somebody learns in Tamil, Telugu, Tamil, Bengal, Malayalam, Gujarati, Marathi or Punjabi languages.
If you don't know swim, swim, swim, you can't have a good picture, but you can try to swim in the paper.
You want to learn to drive your car, ever want to learn to drive auto-rickshaw
You can see that these are the new experiments, the skills that will give you joy and you will be able to get rid of the dragons that have tied your life.
Get out of the past, do something, guys.
It's the opportunity to create a life.
You think all the exams are over, we will learn when we go to the new career, but there will be no chance.
Then you're gonna be in trouble, so I'll tell you, if you're gonna learn the magic of your magic, at least learn its magic.
Keep showing your friends magic.
Try to know what you don't know, you'll definitely be beneficial.
Your inner human qualities will be awakened, there will be a lot of improvement.
I am telling my experience that we cannot even imagine what we can learn from the world.
New places, new cities, new cities, new villages, new areas.
But before going, wherever we are going, there is a way to visit and see, understand, talk among the people, ask, all these efforts can be made, then the joy of seeing that new place increases.
Stay in the same place for four days.
Go to another place and stay for three-four days.
You can learn from this.
Where did you go
You share your experience using Hash Tag Incredible India.
Friends, This time the Government of India has also provided you a good opportunity.
The new generation is almost free from cash transactions.
They need cash.
They started believing in the digital correspondence.
But if someone else refers to someone else or someone else, and the new person does the money thrice, then you will earn ten rupees to do this thing.
Ten rupees will be deposited by your account government.
If you get 20 people in the day, you will get 200 rupees in the evening.
Businesses may also have income, supposed to have income.
This scheme is followed by 14th October and this will happen to you in the form of Digital India.
Now the red wind has gone, so no one can say that the red wind in the mind may have gone out.
I got an interesting phone call.
He also expressed the apprehensions of this phone, but this phone shows that the common man didn't like it at all, they felt a distance.
Namaskar Pradhan Mantri Ji, I am speaking from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh to Shiva Chaube.
I want to tell you something about the government's Red Backen Light Bank.
I don't have to trap the traffic jam, and I don't have to wait for anybody.
I would like to thank you very much for this principle.
Thank you for the cleaning of Dadagiri of the PPs.
The car is a part of the government's system of lighting.
But we have to be eager to get this idea out of our mind.
We all have to do this together.
My dear countrymen, I always say that our history, our culture, our heritage have to be remembered again.
With this, we save energy, get inspiration.
This year, we are conserving the blessings of Saint Ramanujacharya.
However, India is so ancient that we have the opportunity to remember thousands of years or more old memories.
Thousands of years ago, he had campaigned with the authority to enter his temple and succeeded.
We are so fortunate that some of the great men have been born here to distinguish the faults of all ages.
We can inspire him to reflect the spirit of a united effort for social unity when he observes the brilliant jubilee of the saint.
The Government of India will release a postage stamp in memory of Saint on 1st May, 2019.
I remember Saint Ramayana with respect and salute him.
Dear countrymen, there is another significance of the date of May 1 tomorrow.
This day is celebrated as Labour Day in many places of the world.
And when it is a matter of labour day, labour and labourers, then I will remember the story of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
Very few people might know that we are grateful to Babasaheb Ambedkar for the benefits and honour of the workers today.
Babasaheb's role in the welfare of the workers is unforgettable.
Today, when I talk about Babasaheb Ambedkar and Saint Ramanujacharya, I remember the great saints and socialist Jagatguru Basbeshwar of the twelveth century Karnataka.
In the twelfth century, he spoke very well about labour and workers in the language of Kannada.
He spoke in Kannada, Kai Kave Kailas.
This means that through hard work you can reach Shiva's Alaikailas.
Today, when I talk about the workers, it is very natural to remember Dattopant Tengdi.
My dear countrymen, after a few days we will be able to observe intellect.
All the Buddhists of the world celebrate that day.
And in India, the journey from war to Buddha in the life of Mahamati Ashoka is a unique symbol.
In particular, our neighbours are intended to do so.
May the neighbouring countries of India continue to collaborate and develop.
Several projects are underway at the international level.
India will launch South Asia Satellite on 5th May, 2019.
This satellite will facilitate the economic and other development sectors of South Asian countries.
These include mapping of natural resources, telemedicines, education and information technology and people-to-people linkages, the South Asia Satellite will help in our entire progress.
This is an important step from India to enhance cooperation with the entire South Asia - an invaluable gift, an example of our commitment to South Asia.
I convey my best wishes to the South Asian Satellite Project for this special effort.
Mann Ki Baat, March 2017
In every corner of the country, most of the families are busy examining their children.
There is a slight comfort in the exams which have been completed and where the tests are going on, all those families are still under pressure.
But at such a time, I will say that last time, listen to the words that I had spoken to the audience of Mann Ki Baat.
These things will certainly be used for you during the examination.
Today is 26th March.
On March 26, Bangladesh Independence Day.
Historical battle against injustice, the unprecedented victory of the people of Bangladesh under the leadership of Bangladesh.
Today, on this great day, I convey my best wishes to the citizens of Bangladesh for the freedom of our brothers and sisters.
And I would like to assure the people of Bangladesh be it progress, development and Bangladesh that India will be a strong partner, a good friend and we will contribute to peace, security and development in the entire region.
We are all proud of the fact that Rabindranath Tagore, his memories, the heritage of our two countries.
The national music of Bangladesh is also the creation of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore.
A very attractive information about Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is that in 1913 he was not only the first person to be honored with the 1913 AD but also the British gave him the Nighthood .
And when in 1919 the British killed in Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, then Rabindranath Tagore was among those great men who were adversaries and at that time when this incident had a deep impact on the minds of a twelve year old child .
The slaughter of Dil Jallian Walabagh in the field brought a new face in the life of the boy who was walking in the field.
And in 1919, the 12-year-old boy Bhagwat is our beloved, the inspiration of all of us - martyr Bhagwat Singh.
Three days ago, on 23rd March, the British had hung up Bhagat Singh and his colleagues - Sukhdev and Rajguru and we all know that the event on 23rd March - Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru had no satisfaction in the service of Mother India.
They sacrificed all the dreams of life for the freedom of Mother India.
And these three brave men are still inspired by us.
We cannot describe the sacrifices of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru.
The entire British administration was afraid of these three young men.
They're imprisoned in jail, they're fine, but the British were worried about what they could do with them.
And that's why on March 24, there was a fucking crack on 23rd.
It's hiding it that can't be seen normally.
And then their dead bodies were brought to Punjab today and the British were quietly burnt.
Many years ago, when I got the opportunity to go there for the first time, I felt the vibration of that land.
And I will definitely tell the youth of the country that whenever you get the opportunity to visit Punjab, go to the tombs of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Datt.
At this time, the arms of freedom, its intensity, its intensity and mood grew.
On the one hand, heroes like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru inspired the youth for the Armed Revolution.
On the other hand, 100 years ago, on 10th April, 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had performed Satyagraha in Champaran.
This year is the centenary of Champaran Satyagraha.
In the freedom struggle of India, Gandhi Bhavdhara and Gandhi style have been seen for the first time in Champaran.
In the entire movement of independence, it was a bitter change, particularly from the point of view of the confrontational system.
This festival, the Satyagraha of Champaran, the Khada Satyagraha, the labourers of the factories in Ahmedabad, and all these were showing a deep impact on the thoughts and style of work of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1915, Gandhiji returned from abroad and in 1917 he went to a small village in Bihar and inspired the country.
Today, we cannot evaluate the Champaran Satyagraha on the basis of the pictures of Mahatma Gandhi.
Imagine one person who returned to Hindustan in 1915 had worked for only two years.
And Champaran Satyagraha was such a place where the organizational strategy of Mahatma Gandhi, the power to know the veins of the Indian society of Mahatma Gandhi, the weakness against the British administration through Mahatma Gandhi's own behaviour, the creation of the unaware, the motivation of the unaware, the inspiration of the fighting grounds.
Therefore, we can feel the greatness of Mahatma Gandhi.
But if we think about Gandhi a hundred years ago, then the Champaran Satyagraha is a deep study for a person to enter the part of the public life.
We can learn from him how to work in public life, how to work in itself and how Gandhi had done it.
And it was a time when the temporary leaders, whose names we heard, were Rajendrababu, Acharya Kripalani - Gandhi had sent everyone to the village.
Filling up the prison on one side and on the other hand handing yourself to constructive work.
There was a unique balance between Gandhi's style of functioning.
What could be the meaning of Satyagraha, what could be uncomfortable, what could be the meaning of uncomfortableness in the face of such a big empire - not only through words but through a successful presentation, Gandhi presented a new idea.
All the benefits of the people - the uninterrupted effort to do something for the country and for the society will fulfill the dreams of all those great men who gave life to the country's freedom.
And in the 21st century there are Indians who do not want to change, who do not want to be a partner in the progress of the country.
This wish of the progress of 100 crore Indians will sell the seeds of a New India- New India.
There are many people who go to the hospital regularly to serve the patients.
Our country is serving Ratnagarva and Jan Sebai Prabhu.
If we look at this idea together in an organised form then it will be understood how big it is.
In the context of India, different opinions and visions are very common and inevitable.
However, it is also true that if the entire country is making a pledge and taking steps to fulfil it, then the dream of New India can be successful.
It is not necessary that all these works have to be done in the budget or government expenditure.
If every citizen pledges to follow the traffic rules, fulfil his own duty, stop the use of petrol and diesel at least one week, then through this small step we will take new II through this small step.
I will see India's dream to be fulfilled and I will say that everybody should observe his citizenship and perform his duty.
This is how a New India can be started.
The year 2022 will be the 15th year of Indias independence.
I urge you people to follow and resolve your life and participate in this journey of Swaraj to Suraj.
My dear countrymen, today I would like to express my gratitude to you.
BHIM App was started two and a half months ago, but about 1. 5 crore people have already downloaded it.
My dear countrymen, we have to take forward the fight against black money and corruption.
You cannot even imagine that you can become a big partner in the service of the country and can create a brave soldier against black money and corruption.
A few days ago, Digidhan Mela was organized for public education and awareness.
Approximately 12. 5 lakh beneficiaries have received awards and 75,000 beneficiaries have been awarded for businessmen.
Let us participate in this effort to reduce the use of cash transactions and notes.
My dear countrymen, I am happy that whenever you want to suggest Mann Ki Baat, there is a lot of opinion.
But I have noticed that there is no lack of interest in cleanliness.
I think it's very important for the common man to understand how cleanliness is.
I go through a river every day, where people polluted the river by throwing many wastes.
This river comes through the Rispana bridge and flows through our houses.
In order to keep this river clean, I went to Padda and talked to the people, smiled, but it didn't benefit.
I would like to urge you to send a team here or publish it through newspapers.
Brothers and sisters, See how hard a girl from the eleventh century is.
How angry he sees the dirty waste in the river
I think it's a good signal.
I would like to see the anger of 125 crore Indians in the minds of the people.
Once there is anger, if there is dissatisfaction, if there is anxiety then we will be able to do something in the campaign against waste.
It's a good thing that Gayatri has expressed his anger, advised me and said that he tried a lot, but failed.
Since the Swachhta Movement has started, awareness has increased.
Everyone has been associated with it positively.
It took the form of a movement.
Hate towards waste is increasing gradually.
Be it human beings aware, actively participate in the movement, it has its own significance.
This movement is possible in all its way.
It's hard to work, but we have to do it.
I believe that the awareness among the youth of the country, among the children, among the teachers, among the youth, is indicative of a good conclusion in a comprehensive manner.
Today, those who are listening to my Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell the people of the country that the singer's speech should be spoken to us.
As much as you don't have half the stomach, and leave it there.
Sometimes you've ever seen how much waste we quit the uninterrupted food we left.
Have you ever seen this thing that if you don't cheat, then how poor people can fill the stomach.
There's nothing to understand about this.
Normally when mother feeds small children in our house, then say as much as you can eat.
There is a lot of effort in this field but in spite of this, apathy is a publicity of social disorder.
This is injustice to the poor.
Secondly, if savings are made, the family will also get financial benefits.
The ideas are good for the society, but it is such that the family will also benefit from it.
I don't want to say anything about this, but I want to increase awareness.
I know some youngsters who are associated with this kind of movement.
The youth of our country works like this.
This kind of people will be found somewhere in every state of the country.
Their work can inspire us so that we don't digest food.
We'll take as much as we'll eat.
This is the way to change.
And those who are healthy , they always say - keep the plate empty , keep the stomach empty .
When it came to the point of health then say , ' World Health Day ' on 7th April .
The United Nations has set a target of Universal Health Coverage for All by 2030.
This time, the United Nations focused on the Depression on the World Health Day on April 7.
According to a survey, more than 150 crore people in the world are victims of mental depression.
The problem is that many people around us are victims of this disease, but we don't understand it, and maybe we feel hesitant to talk about it.
I want to tell my countrymen that depression is not such that it will not be freed from it.
As soon as he built a psychological campus, he began to get rid of it.
The first thing is depression - who should express him without suppressing.
Tell your friends to parents and brothers and teachers what is happening in you.
Did you ever think that guy is doing this
You're sure this is the first symptom of depression.
If someone wants to keep away from the middle of everyone, keep in mind, don't let him alone.
Let's stay with those whom he likes to be with.
Encourage him to speak funnyly, and find out what his knot is hiding deep in your mind.
In diseases like diabetes, people become physically weak, depression reduces the thinking of human beings, takes courage, reduces the strength of fighting in lifetime and destroys all our life force.
Your self-confidence will come back if you start resolving the problems of others with the mind of service.
If you can meet yourself with others, serve yourself and if you can do it selflessly, see if your mind gets lighter in unnecessarily.
Yoga is a practice but a good way to keep the mind healthy.
Yoga is a very effective way for eradication from mind, freedom from respiratory conditions and happiness.
The International Day of Yoga is celebrated every year on 21st June.
If you want to give some suggestions to the International Day of Yoga, send me all those ideas through my mobile app.
As much as poems, songs and songs can be written with yoga, so that there can be an inspiration among the common people.
This time I will tell you something about mothers and sisters and many things have been spoken about healthcare.
A few days ago, the Government of India has taken an important decision.
This is why the Government of India has taken a very important decision.
The maternity leave given during pregnancy of women working during pregnancy, pregnancy and pregnancy was 12 weeks ago.
In this regard, only two or three countries of the world are ahead of us.
When these children grow up, they will be the wealth of the country.
New Year festivals are celebrated in different parts of our country.
Ugadi, Sindhi Cheti Chand, Kashmir Navreh, Ayodh, Sambatsar Puja, Jud Cold in Mithila, Bihar and Satwani in Magadh are celebrated in Maharashtra.
A large country is full of diversity in India.
My best wishes to all of you on New Year
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, February 2017
The bird's bullshit brings a pleasant jewellery.
Not only flowers but also fruits in the branches of the trees are brightened in the sunlight.
The seasonal fruits of the summer are also seen in this spring.
Similarly, in the field of farming, mustard yellow flowers are expected to grow in the chest.
Place's red flowers indicate the arrival of Holi.
Amir has given a very beautiful description of the climate change.
He wrote: The jungle is bursting, the mustard flourishes, the place is bursting, the Kokil is calling, Kuhu-Kuhu.
When the color of joy in nature, when it touches joy in the form of a sage, people also enjoy that joy.
Spring Panchami, Mahashivaratri and Holi festivals make the lives of people colorful.
And so he said that I should tell you about 104 satellites and interceptor missiles.
Shobhaji thanked you very much for remembering the pride of India.
Whether it is fighting poverty, protecting itself from disease, connecting with the world, inspiring knowledge or information, technology and science have proved their role.
On 15th February, 2017, a glorious day in the national life of India.
Our scientists have raised our heads to the world.
And we know that in a few years, ISRO has completed several unprecedented projects with success.
ISRO has recently set up a World Record in the field of Space Expedition after the success of sending Mars Mission to Mangalyaan.
India is the first country in the world to create history by sending 104 satellites together in Mahakash.
And it is also happy that this is the 38th Sustainable Launch of PSLV.
This is not just ISRO but also a historic achievement for the entire India.
ISRO's cost effective space programme has been a miracle to the world and has appreciated the success of Indian scientists in the open minds of the world.
My farmer brothers and sisters, especially my farmer brothers and sisters, will be able to know that the new satellite cartosat-2D will help us in how to use the water resources in our country.
We've sent some pictures to our satellite room.
It's starting his job.
We are also happy to note that our young scientists and women scientists have led these campaigns.
This tragic collaboration of youth and women is a great pride in the success of ISRO.
I appreciate the geographical appreciation of ISRO scientists on behalf of the countrymen.
For the common man, they have always imbibed the purpose of using space science for the service of the nation and are creating new achievements everyday.
The more we appreciate these scientists, their team, the less it will be.
Shobhaji had another question and it was related to India's security.
India has completed the successful test of Ballisticinterceptor missile in defence sector.
Interception technologies, this missile has been successful in carrying about 100 kilometres of Upeshtra missiles from the soil while flying its tests.
This is an important achievement in defence sector.
When we see new technologies, see new scientific achievements, we are happy.
And asking has played a big role in the development of human life.
And whoever intellectuals do not let him ask in the form of asking, he also communicates questions, find new questions, creates new questions.
Asks are the reasons for new inventions.
They are not calm until the answer is answered.
And if we see the stream of development of human life for thousands of years, then we can say that there is no integration in the stream of this development of human life.
Perfection is impossible.
Efforts of creation of the universe continue to be made to know the human beings.
New science, new technologies are born from it.
And every technologies, every new form of science, gives a new generation.
My dear youngsters, when we talk about science, when we talk about the hard work of the scientists, I remember that this Mann Ki Baat programme has said that the youth should be attracted to science.
There are many scientists in the country.
Today's scientists will launch a sustainable change in the lives of future generations.
Keeping in mind the needs of the common man, science can become a man's synonym when he researches and discoveries and how the discovery will be used for the common man, science becomes a man's synonym.
This is where I saw an innovation in our daily poor fishermen.
All such innovations have been achieved from this competition.
Different services are going to pace with technology.
Technologies have become an integral part of life.
Indias Digital Transmission Rate is increasing.
In particular, the youth are removing digital payments from their hands.
I think it's a good symptom.
Lacky Consumer Scheme, Digi Dhan Bachar Yojana has been a big boost.
It's almost two months since these two schemes, 15,000 people are awarding Rs. 1,000 per day.
Many have received a reward of Rs. 1 lakh in this scheme.
More than four thousand businesses have been paid up to Rs.
Mr. Santosh, Mysore has conveyed happiness in the Narendra Modi App that he received Rs. 1,000 awards in the Lucky Consumer Scheme.
Then I believe that Mr. Santosh should share with you what he wrote.
I feel so nice to know that Santosh ji, your name and work have made us all very happy.
On the one hand, as he is driving, he has become an ambassador to the Lakey Consumer Scheme.
Carryers are also encouraging them with enthusiastics about the digital system and many others have started participating in the digital system.
A young companion from Maharashtra, Pooja Nemadh, a young companion from Maharashtra, interacted with his friends about how the use of RuPay card, e-walet is being done.
One lakh rupees prize is important for him and he is also encouraging others to take this mission.
This work has played an important role in fighting corruption and black money in a way.
Remember a day.
A few days ago, Babasaheb Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary had gone away.
Remembering him, you also learn to upload the minimum 125 BHIMs.
Learn how transactions are done through this.
Therefore, I want to say that the foundation stone that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar had laid, we have to strengthen it.
The BHIM App has to be taken up by 125 crore people at home.
The movement that has been going on for the last three months has been successful in many villages and cities.
My dear countrymen, agriculture has contributed a lot to the economy of our country.
The economic power of the village provides strength to the economic pace of the country.
Today I want to tell you a joy.
Our farmer brothers and sisters have worked hard and filled their food grains.
The hard work of our farmers has resulted in the production of rice this year.
Everything indicates that our farmers have broken the old records.
The way the crops have flown in the fields this year, it seems every day that the festival of Pongal or Vaishakhi is celebrated.
This year, more than two thousand tons of foodgrains have been produced in the country.
The last record of our farmers was more than eight percent.
It's a wonderful achievement.
I would like to particularly thank the farmers of the country.
I am glad that the farmers of the country have listened to the poor and pulses have been cultivated in about two million hectare land.
This is not just the production of pulses, it is the biggest service of the poor of the country by the farmers.
I would like to express my gratitude to the farmer brothers and sisters of my country for their hard work and manufacturing a record amount of pulses.
My dear countrymen, in our country, by the government, by the society, by the institutions, by the organisations, some or the other programmes are going on for cleanliness through everybody.
In some way, everybody is aware of cleanliness in a way.
The seminar on the shutdown of Varangal in the State of Telangana has been highlighted with the importance of direct cleanliness.
The Toilet Pit Emptying Exercise was organized in Hyderabad on 17th and 18th February.
Six household toilet pits have been cleaned and officers have shown themselves how to use the Twin Pit toilets.
They also showed how convenient the toilets of this new technique and there is no other problem or narrowness in the toilets till it is cleared.
We also work to clean small toilets like we can clean the toilets.
A Standard Twin PitToilet for the family of six members is filled in about five-six years.
Our farmers are well aware of the NPK.
Different government departments and Cleanliness Centres have been observed differently.
For the first time in March, the Ministry of Women and Child Development and the Ministry of Tribal Development will participate in the Swachhta Abhiyan.
For the second time in March, the Ministry of Shipping and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation will conduct Swachhta Abhiyan.
We know that whenever any citizen of our country does something remarkable, the whole country gets a new energy and confidence.
We all welcomed the performance of our Divyang sportspersons in Rio Paralympics.
In the Blind T-20 World Cup Flag organized this month, India has lost Pakistan for the second time and has enhanced the pride of the country.
I once again congratulate all the sportspersons of this team.
The country is proud of the success of these Divyang friends.
I always know that Divyang brothers and sisters are incomplete with support, strong mind, courage and determination.
Always we can learn something new from them.
Whether it is sports or space science, the daughters of our country are not lagging behind.
They have moved on foot and are proud of the country in their success.
A few days ago, our women sportspersons won the silver medal in the ASEAN RAGBISEVENS event.
I congratulate all these sportspersons.
Beti Bachao Beti Padhao movement is moving at a rapid pace.
This is not just a government project but it has now become a campaign for social consciousness and public education.
In the last two years, the common man has been associated with this scheme.
The flames that are being obtained from every corner of the country are compulsory to think about the common man and the mindset of the people has been changing for years.
When there is a news that the festival was celebrated on the occasion of the birth of a daughter, then it is really very happy.
This kind of positive thinking towards daughter-in-law paves the way for social recognition.
I am aware that the Cuddalore district of Tamil Nadu has been able to stop child marriage by running a special campaign.
So far, more than 175 child marriage installations have been closed.
More than 55-60,000 bank accounts have been opened in the Sukna Samriddha Yojana.
Under the Har Ghar Dashtak Yojana in Madhya Pradesh, every village has been undertaken to educate children in every household.
Through your Children's Apara Vidyalaya campaign, Rajasthan is undertaking a campaign to incentivize the students who leave the school without finishing their education.
New imaginations are also linked to this.
It has been changed as per local requirements.
You are actively associated with this.
I know something from you.
What is happening in the world, the thoughts of the poor people of the village reach me.
I am very grateful for your cooperation.
Mann Ki Baat, August 2019
Perhaps our ancestors have decorated our seasonal cycle, economic ethos and social systems in such a way that there is no laxity in social life in any situation.
In the last few days, we have celebrated a lot of festivals.
Yesterday, the birth anniversary of Shri Krishna was celebrated throughout India.
Shri Krishna is an individual who created innovation, inspiration and innovation in every festival even after thousands of years, which is the past of our imagination.
He can still inspire him to be an example of any problem.
Anyone who can find solutions to any present problem from Sri Krishna's life.
On the other hand, despite such a great personality, it can be said to have agreed to work in the battlefield.
Sometimes climbing the mountains, sometimes the packets of food, everybody feels innovation.
Today, when I talk to you, my mind is moving towards two fronts.
One Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan, the other Chakradhar Mohan.
Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan left the banks of the Yamuna river and went to Dwarka city on the sea shore of Gujarat and spent the last day of his life in Delhi on the banks of Yamuna.
Thousands of years ago, Sudarshan Chakradhar Mohan used his intellect, duties, courage and thought to avoid the war.
My dear countrymen, I am talking about the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
On the Porbandar sea shore, which we call the Kirti Mandir today, a small house was born on 2nd October, 1869, not only a person, but a period of age, who had shown a new path to human history, had established a new excellence.
Milk labourers who were not given labour, they served them.
He used to serve the poor, unbearable, hungry and hungry people as one of the duties of life.
He served the leprosy patients to prove the misconception among the common people about leprosy, so that others are inspired.
Whenever any person is in danger, Mahatma Gandhi used to leave to help him.
He not only emphasized on service but also knew the importance of the satisfaction in service.
The word 'Seva' is enjoyable only if it is done with joy then it becomes 'Seva Param Dharma'.
But at the same time, the real joy of 'Sant Sukhay' is also inherent in service.
This is what we can easily understand if we monitor the life of Gandhiji.
In the life of Mahatma Gandhi, individuals and society, humanity and humanity were the only thoughts.
Whether it is Africa's Phoenix farm or tollstoy farm, Sarmati Ashram or Vardha, he used to focus on community mobilisation for social development.
I have got the opportunity to pay homage to the great privilege of my life by visiting various works of the revered Mahatma Gandhi.
Gandhiji also emphasized the spirit of service as well as the spirit of organisational power.
We want to use social service and social integrity, community service and community mobilization.
Will you come and go away, can we accept it
There is no obstacle, if he works in the spirit of self-sufficient dedication, he feels a unique joy.
My dear countrymen, I went to Dandi in Gujarat a few months ago.
Several events, competitions, exhibitions etc. are being organized in the coming days.
I'll give you a wonderful news on this occasion.
In this, the Haripura panels were particularly psychological.
You remember that the session was held in Haripura in Gujarat, where the events of the Presidential election of Subhas Chandra Bose are recorded in history.
These Art Panels have a very beautiful past.
Before the Haripura session in 1937-38, Mahatma Gandhi invited the then Chairman of Shantiniketan, Nandlal Bose.
Gandhiji wanted to show the lifestyle of people living in India through art and showcase this art work session.
This is the Nandlal Bose whose artefacts enhance our Constitution.
It gives the Constitution a new identity.
This church of his art has provided immortality to Nandlal Bose along with the Constitution.
Nandlal Bose monitored the villages around Haripura and then made some art canvas about rural India.
This precious artwork was discussed in Venice.
Once again, with the congratulations of Gandhiji on his 150th anniversary, I urge every Indian to take some pledge.
For the country, for the society, for the others, something or the other should be done.
This will be our beauty, truth and true tribute to Bapu.
Children of Mother India, you must remember that for the last few years, we have launched Swachhta Hi Seva campaign in the country for two weeks before 2nd October.
This year it will start from September 11.
This time we have to put special emphasis on plastic.
There is enthusiasm among all sections of the society about this mission.
Many of my business brothers and sisters have planted a placard in the shops, where it is written that Khariddar brings his bag together.
It can also save money and also showcase its partnership to protect the environment.
This time on 2nd October, when Bapu is celebrating 150 years, I will not only dedicate him to the Open Defecation Free India but will also lay the foundation stone of a new mass movement against plastic.
I urge all sections of the society, every village, every village, every citizen and the residents of the city to pray together and pray that this year's Gandhi Jayanti should be celebrated in a way to free our mother India from the plastic jungle.
May the 2nd October be a special day.
It can be recycled.
It can be used as fuel.
There is no need to see here for inspiration and no one can be inspiring than Gandhiji.
My dear countrymen, our culture is defined and a gem of knowledge.
Today, I want to touch an important thing by a Sanskrit subhaita, it is a thing written long ago, but it still has a huge importance.
The foolish stones are called gems.
Our culture has a lot of dignity in food.
We have also transformed food grain knowledge into science.
We need balanced and nutritious food, especially for women and newborn children.
People are fighting malnutrition in new and entertaining ways.
On the day of harvesting, Anganwadi servicers used to collect one peanut crop from everyone.
These foodgrains were used to produce hot food for children and women.
This has led to a conscious citizen and a social worker.
After that, he dedicated himself to this objective and became a soldier in this movement.
Liquid food is not solid food.
In Gujarat, in 2010, it was thought that the child should be given compulsory food at the Annaprashan programme so that the minds of the people become aware.
This is a very important initiative that can be adopted everywhere.
In many states, people celebrate the 'Thithi Bhoj' campaign.
If there is a birthday, a good day or a memorial day in a family, then the members of the family make a tasty, nutritious food and go to anganwadi, school and the family members make their own children eat food and share their joy among all, which adds to happiness.
This is a unique combination of service and joy.
Friends, There are many small things that our country can fight against malnutrition.
Today, due to lack of awareness, Nutrition has affected both the poor and the rich families.
The Nutrition Abhiyan will be celebrated throughout the country in September.
You must be associated with this campaign, collect information and add new ideas.
If you can protect one person from malnutrition, then our country will also be able to protect our country from malnutrition.
This time when I was thinking about Mann Ki Baat, I was convinced that there would be a lot of questions on this issue and that was why.
In the last few weeks, wherever I have visited and whom I have met, the issue of Man Vs Wild has come up.
Through this episode, I have been united not only with India but also with the youth of all over the world and I have never thought that I will have such a place in the minds of the youth.
I have never thought of how diverse things our country and the youth of the world are looking at.
Last week I went to Bhutan.
That's what I feel.
Tigers, Lions, Life-cultures, I am surprised how many people can encourage.
I am convinced that people now want to know the steps taken in India for climate justice and clean environment.
Is it admit later
Look, there's no mystery in it.
Some people have questions about this, so I'm unveiling this mystery.
It's not a mystery.
I used to say Hindi but he used to hear in English and that's why talks would be very easy and this is what technology has done.
After this show, I have noticed that many people are discussing Jim Corbett National Park.
You should also go to the natural and wildlife-driven places of nature and wildlife.
I said before, I'm telling you again, you must go to the North East.
Your mind will spread.
On 15th August, I had requested all of you from the Red Fort that in the next three years, 15 places of India should go to 15 places for 100 tourism, see, discuss, take the family and spend some time there.
Your life, your emotions will spread.
Last month, it was fortunate to release the country's population.
Do you know how many tigers are in India
There are 2967 tigers in India.
A few years ago, half of it was suffering.
The Tiger Summit was held in St. Petersburg, Russia in 2010 with tigers.
Here, a resolution was taken by expressing concern over the declining number of tigers in the world.
The resolution was to double the number of tigers in the world by 2022.
But this is a New India where we have achieved the goals very fast.
We have doubled the number of tigers here by 2019.
The number of tigers in India has not only increased, but also the number of protected areas and community reserves.
When I was publishing the story of tigers, I remember the lion of the Gir Forest in Gujarat.
When I was in charge of the Chief Minister of Gujarat, the residence of the lion was contracted in the jungle of Gir.
Their number was decreasing.
We have done a lot of work in the Gir.
In 2007, I decided to appoint a female guard there.
It is possible to improve the tourism industry through infrastructure development.
In terms of nature and wildlife, we only focus on conservation.
Now we have to think about the conservation of ourselves in the context of compassion or sympathy.
My dear countrymen, can we forget the historic speech of Swami Vivekananda on September 11, 1893
The bright speech of this young Indian saint was awakened among the humanity all over the world.
In 1893, the world was forced to discover the bright words of Swami Vivekananda in September 1893.
Come, let us build the power that Swami Vivekananda had seen in India.
On this occasion, we are going to launch Fit India Movement in the country.
You have to keep yourself fit, make the country fit.
This will be a very attractive campaign for the elderly and the elderly.
But today I don't know about it in detail.
Wait for 29th August.
2nd October for Total Dedicated Plastic.
With all our strength, we will join the campaign to keep houses and around it free of plastic.
I am confident that this campaign will illuminate the social media.
Let us start this campaign with a new zeal, a new resolve and a new energy.
I waited for your messages and advice.
Let us go through the mantra of inner joy and service.
Thank you very much, Namaskar
Mann Ki Baat, January 2017
The Constitution of India, the duties of the citizens, the rights of the citizens, our commitment to democracy - in a sense, reforms that make the future generation aware about democracy, the responsibility of democracy and reforms.
However, in our country, the duties of the citizens and the rights of the citizens should be discussed as deep as possible, the widespread discussions should be done.
I hope that at every level, at every minute, as much as is given on the right, should be given on the same jurisdiction.
Indias democracies can move on both the paths of rights and duties.
Yesterday, 30th January, our revered Babapur Punya Tithi.
We pay homage to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the nation on 30th January at 11 a.m.
We should become a common habit of observing a two-minute tribute to the united society as a nation, on 30th January, at 11.
On the eve of this Republic Day, I convey my greetings to the brave soldiers who have been awarded the various braveness awards and their families.
These awards include Kirti Chakra, Saurya Chakra, Param Vishisht Seva Medal, Voluntary Seva Medal.
I would like to appeal to the youth, especially those who are very active in the social media, can you do one thing
This time, the jewellery who has been awarded this honor - find the Internet and write a citation on them and get them to your friends.
When we know about their courage, valour and valour in a detail, we are proud and inspired.
On the one hand, when we were happy about the celebrations and enthusiasm of January 26, at the same time, our soldiers in Kashmir, who are determined to protect the country, are brave in their lives due to the storms.
I pay homage to all these brave soldiers and salute them.
My young friends, you are well aware that I am constantly listening to Mann Ki Baat.
All these months of January, February, March, April are the months of examination in every family.
One-and-a-half or two children of the world are tested but the entire family is under pressure from the test.
There is a very different psychological atmosphere in every world.
And I have always been aware that we should come out of it and that is why today I want to talk to young friends in a detail in detail.
When I announced this thing, many teachers, parents and students sent me messages, asked me, asked me, wrote about pain, mentioned concerns and after seeing all these things, I wanted to share with you today.
I've sent a telephone message from the creation.
Anyway, the question has been raised, but the same question is certainly in your mind.
The test must be a pleasure.
There is an opportunity to tell you all that work has been done throughout the year, it should be a festival of hope and enthusiasm.
You're gonna have to decide that you're gonna think it's pressury, no, please.
And when the festival takes place, the best in us comes out.
During the festival, the society finds its strength.
During the examination, there should be an atmosphere of festival in the neighbourhood between family and friends.
Be enthusiastically playing the role of yourself in accomplishing this festival like a team, see how soon it changes.
Indeed, from Kashmir to Kanyakumarika, from Kutch to Kakam, from Amreli to Arunachal, these three-four months only tests and tests.
It is our responsibility that every year these three-four months, in their own ways, in their own ways, in their own traditions, in the environment of their own family, it has become a festival.
And so I'll tell you "smile more score more".
And you have seen that when you are happy, you feel comfortable when you are laughing, you feel comfortable.
You remember the whole scene of what the teacher said in the classroom a year ago.
Sometimes it feels like we can't see the test properly.
I think the test is a question of life and death.
The test means the evaluation of what you've been studying for the whole year.
J.
A bright example of Kalam.
He wanted to contribute to the Air Force but was uncomfortable.
Remember, if he had been disappointed after this failure, would he have gone to a scientific place
This has not only increased competition among children but also increased tensions.
I would like to know your views on the current situation and future of the education system.
Whatever you realize in your life is your knowledge, your skills, your self-confidence and determination.
You don't think he's a good doctor, then you must go to him.
When you go to a Nameukil during the case of big cases, do you look for his marksheet
You have seen his experience, his knowledge and success.
That is why sometimes the burden of this number is at the interval of our right path.
If you analyze, you will see that when you run for numbers, you will find the way easier and focus on certain things, but you will be uncomfortable when you face a problem outside this ball.
And that is why sometimes it happens that even after being very grateful to the test, we face failure in life.
Richa has raised another topic, that's the competition.
It's a very big psychological area.
In this regard, we can give the example of China Tendulkar.
Friends, when you are going to test every aspect of life, especially when you are going to test, then see if you used to give two hours before, what have you been able to do for three hours
When I thought of getting up in the past, it was too late, can you get up at the right time
Mr. S.
This way he helped me.
My mother couldn't pass the tenth test, but it was not possible for me to pass the CBSE test if she didn't get help.
Beautiful-ji, you said right.
You have certainly seen that those who ask me, suggest me, the number of women is more.
If you learn to acknowledge once, many problems will be solved there.
If it doesn't acknowledge, it's the way to solve this problem.
Hope makes the road difficult.
Acknowledging the present situation, there is an opportunity to open a new road to solve.
So accept what you have.
Look, you'll be loaded.
We talk about the weight of the school bags of small children, but sometimes I feel like parents, aspirations and aspirations of children are more than the school bag.
Years ago, because of heart attack, one of our well-known people was in hospital.
In fact, we go to the sick person and fear him about the disease.
I would like to tell the parents that sometimes we are like this with the children.
Have you ever thought that on the day of the test, I will give you an opportunity to laugh at children.
You'll see the situation changes.
I've got a funny phone.
The gentleman didn't want to tell his name.
When you hear the details of the phone, you can understand why he doesn't want to publish his name.
Namaskar, Prime Minister, I did something in my fame that I couldn't tell my name.
I tried to duplicate once in my childhood.
I've been wasting a lot of time to think about how to duplicate, how to duplicate.
If I spent that time to study, I could get the same number.
When I tried to duplicate, I got to know and there was a problem for many friends around me.
I'm telling you the same thing again.
So where will you reach
Remember, you yourself are finding your own pathbreaks, creating obstacles.
I have also seen that some people are using all their talents and utilizing the creative power to duplicate.
If I talk about the game during the exams, then everyone will say how this is the Prime Minister
Because the students who think of the common man will be incapable of studying.
Besides the brain, the rest should have the right activity of the body.
If you take a break for five minutes, you'll feel that you're reading too much.
I don't know if Sabbar likes this, but I told me about my confidence.
Once a folk musician came to meet me.
He asked me how long did you sleep
I mean, brother, are you a doctor
He said, Hey, no, you don't tell me, it's related to your throat to give this statement.
If you sleep properly, you'll get your breakfast card.
I didn't think of my sleep and throat before.
He gave me a simple tack.
Don't do that even if you forget, you'll be happy with me.
Otherwise, when the marksheet comes, the parents will be able to see my reflection instead of you.
If you sleep, you're gonna work, don't think about it.
Sports also play a vibrant role in keeping mind, intellect and body stable.
Go ahead with this mantra.
Dear countrymen, on 1st February this year, the Indian Coast Guard has completed forty years.
On this occasion, I congratulate every personnel and soldiers of the Coast Guard for their duties towards the country.
Our Coast Guard has achieved its pride in the world's four best coast guards in collaboration with 126 warships and 62 aircraft built in our country.
The Ministry of Coast Guard, Aym Raksham, in keeping with this commitment, our Coast Guard Force has always been prepared to safeguard the maritime border and maritime areas of the country.
Last year, the Coast Guard Force had planned to keep the coastal clean along with their original work and thousands of ordinary citizens were involved in it.
We have a female pilot officer in the Coast Guard and they are also transparent to handle the hovercraft.
Spring Rituraj.
Saraswati Puja is held in Basant-Panchami.
For the sake of learning, it is blessed for worship.
It is not only a learning but also a festival of inspiration for valour.
My Rang Devasanti Chola is the inspiration.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the people of the country on the occasion of this Spring Panchami.
My dear countrymen, the Akashwani has filled the Mann Ki Baat programme with more colorful thoughts.
Last month, after my address to Mann Ki Baat, Mann Ki Baat has started listening to regional languages.
This effort has made great success.
People from far off places have written letters about this.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to them for this self-inspired effort of Akashwani.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2016
My best wishes to all of you on Christmas.
Today is the day to achieve service, sacrifice and compassion in our lives.
The rescuer Jesus said, "Our recognition is not beneficial for the poor.
There's a lot of popular stories about this.
Lord Jesus was once standing near a temple treasury.
A lot of rich people came and donated a lot.
After that, a poor widow came and paid two copper pieces.
On one side, two copper donors donate money.
The birth anniversary of Mahamati Madan Mohan Malavya ji, who awakened the resolve and self-confidence of the Indian people, had shown a new direction to the modern education system.
On his birthday, I pay homage to Bhav-Gabhi.
Just two days ago, I had the opportunity to inaugurate Malavyaji's penance place in Banaras.
He also laid the foundation stone of the Mohammati Madan Mohan Malva Cancer Centre at Banaras Hindu University.
Cancer Centre is being built for the entire region, which will not only benefit the people of Uttar Pradesh but also the people of Jharkhand and Bihar.
Today is the birthday of Prime Minister of India, Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji.
This country will never forget the contribution of Atal ji.
Our country is also headed by him in the field of nuclear energy.
Atal ji had established an ideal in every role of Leaders, Members of Parliament, Ministers or Prime Ministers.
I bow to Atal ji on his birth anniversary and pray to God for his health.
I am fortunate to work with Atal ji as an employee.
Several memories are looking in front of the eyes.
This morning, when I tweeted, I shared an old video and how Atal ji's affection towards a small worker was rained, it will be understood only by looking at the video.
As a big gift, all the countrymen are going to take advantage of two schemes today.
Everyone wants to understand and learn each other.
In order to encourage this thing, the Government of India is formulating an encouraging scheme for consumers and small businesses to make e-payment a habit to enhance the strength of mobile banking.
The scheme to promote consumers is the name of 'Laki Consumer Scheme' and 'DG-Dhan Baat Yojana'.
On 25th December, Christmas gifts will be provided to 15,000 persons accounts for one thousand rupees.
Today, not just for one day, this scheme will continue for the next 100 days.
15,000 people will be awarded every day.
Millions of rupees will be provided to lakhs of families in 100 days but they will be eligible to be Mobile Banking, E-Banking, Rupee Card, UPI.
Use the Digital Transaction Systems such as USSD etc.
The DG-Dhan Baat Yojana is for the businessmen.
As the businessmen themselves connect themselves with this scheme, the consumers will also be involved in cashlessing their business.
Businessmen will also be awarded separately and the number of awards will be thousands.
The award will not be available for those who can buy more than Rs. 3,000.
The poorest of the poor can sell and eradicate prices through Feature phones and ordinary phones with the help of USSD and all of them will get the opportunity to get the awards for this scheme.
The people of rural areas will be able to win the award through AEPS.
Your family's children of ten or twelve classes will be able to teach you this technique well.
It's very easy to send a Whats App from mobile phones.
My dear countrymen, I am happy to know how to use technology in the country, how to make e-payment and how to make online payments.
Cashless business has increased by 200 to 300 in the last few days.
The Government of India has taken a big decision to promote this process.
This decision is that businessmen can easily guess how big it is.
Those traders who exchange digital transactions, extend online payment systems instead of cash in their businesses, will be exempted from income tax.
I know that the Government of Assam has announced a 10 discount by providing property taxes and business licenses for digitalization.
The branches of Rural Banks have decided that at least 75 per cent of their consumers will be awarded Rs. 50,000 by their Government by making two digital transactions from January to March.
On 31st March, 2017, if a village has been digitally transformed by 100, the Government has announced an award of Rs. 5 lakh through the Uttam Panchayat for DG Transaction Scheme.
For the farmers, the Government of Assam has decided to confer the awards of Rs. 5,000 to the first 10 farmers who are fully pursued to buy seeds and fertilizers under the Digital Kisan Shiromani scheme.
I congratulate the Government of Assam and congratulate the States who have taken such initiatives.
Interestingly, GNFC's fertilizer sales increased by 27 compared to last year.
Brothers and sisters, In our economy, we have the importance of unorganized sectors in our daily life.
In most cases, the wages of these people are paid in cash, money or wages for work and we know that workers are also disbursed for this.
80 instead of Rs. 100, Rs. 80, Rs. 50 is given to these workers and other benefits including health insurance like insurance are disbursed.
But when cashless payments are made, the money is directly deposited in the bank.
Our country is the youngest country.
Technology is easy to us.
A nation like India should move forward in this field.
Our youth have made a lot of improvement through start-ups.
This digital movement should be a golden opportunity, our younger generation should take new ideas, with new technologies and with new technologies.
We have to join the country with full strength in the campaign to free the country from black money and economic corruption.
My dear countrymen, I urge people before every Mann Ki Baat programme, send your suggestions, suggest your opinions and suggestions on MyGov and Narendra Modi App this time.
The authors of the second group who have emphasized upon this thing, such a good work, work for the betterment of the country, such a sacred work, but they have detailed how new ways are being adopted against it.
Mr. Gurumani Keobal wrote in MyGov: This step is commendable for bringing money in black money.
As a citizen, our discomfort is right, but we are cooperating with the fight against corruption.
We are playing the role of the army in the fight against corruption, black money etc.
This feeling is coming up from all corners of the country.
We all feel it.
Indeed, they are the fulfilment of Agent of Change.
I would like to thank everyone for another reason, not only the difficulties they have suffered, but also the people who are trying to mislead the common man.
Not only this, some people have opened these magnificences with their intellect, power and creativity and have brought the truth to the fore.
I salute this power of the people.
People are the genius of God, the blessings of the people are God.
I thank the people of the country, salute the people of the country for taking part in this great zeal against corruption and black money.
I had asked for a detailed discussion on political parties and political funding as well as the fight against corruption and black money.
Those who are running political parties have a lot of discounts, they are wrong.
This government is the government of the people.
On the other hand, I said on the first day-eight, this is a wonderful fight.
There is a lot of news from the government system, from the common citizens.
The success we have achieved is basically because of the awareness of the people.
Can anyone imagine, how much is the danger of our country's aware citizens to open their faces
If you get your help, this fight will be very easy.
Those who send me the letter, one of them is the third, many of them.
They are saying that Modi ji will not stop, do not get tired, take as many steps as possible.
We have to win this war, there is no question of tiredness.
We have brought it out and we have made the Benami Property Act very hard.
This law will play its role in the coming days.
It is our primary duty that is enormous for the countrymen and the people.
In the past, India has established itself with pride in many sectors in the world economy.
As per the World Investment Report published by UNCTAD, India has reached third position in the 2016-18 Top Prospective Host Economy.
India has improved 32 places in the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum.
Similarly, the World Banks Logistics Performance Index-2016 shows Indias 19-stage growth.
Similarly, in some other reports, India is making rapid progress.
My dear countrymen, this time the Parliament session has created light among the people of the country.
Their anger has been expressed in different ways in the proceedings of the Parliament.
The President and the Vice President also expressed their zeal in this regard.
But sometimes there is a good thing in these things, then the heart is filled with happiness.
There was a good work in the House of Parliament which was not seen by the people of the country.
Brothers and sisters, Today I am glad to say that a bill has been taken in Parliament for the people with disabilities.
Our government is committed to the Disabilities.
My Divyang brothers and sisters have added strength to this endeavour when they won four medals in Para Olympics.
This victory has not only enhanced the respect of the country but has wondered the countrymen.
Like other citizens of the country, our disabled brothers and sisters are an invaluable wealth and power.
Today, I am happy that the passage of this Act will provide more employment to the disabled.
Increasing the limit of reservation in government jobs has been increased by 4.
The Act provides for education, convenience and grievances of Divyangjan.
As per the vision of the Nation, the government has enacted this new law.
A few such criteria have been created for persons with disabilities so that they can get the right opportunity and justice for the first time.
Thalassemia, Parkinson's diseases and sexes have also been linked to it.
My young friends, in the last few weeks, there has been news from the field of sports so that we all are proud.
Being an Indian, it is natural for us to be proud.
The Indian Cricket team won 4-0 in England.
The performance of some young sportspersons is very commendable.
The testing was done by the great Kohli not only a good guidance, but also a good leadership.
I convey my best wishes to all of them.
Even after 15 years, there was a good news in Hockey.
I congratulate these young sportspersons for their success.
This success is a good sign for the future of the Indian Hockey Party.
Our women sportspersons have also achieved great success last month.
The Indian women hockey team won the Asian Games and a few days ago, the Indian women hockey team won the medal in 18 Asia Cups.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the cricket and hockey players.
My dear countrymen, the year 2017 is a new year of hope and enthusiasm.
Mann Ki Baat, November 2016
Last month we all celebrated Deepawali.
Every year, on the occasion of Deepawali, I went to the border of China to celebrate Diwali with the army.
I have celebrated Deepawali festivals in the higher areas of the Himalayas with the soldiers of ITBP.
Every year I go to the border, but this time Deepawali's experience is quite different.
They were full of that emotion and not only did I see a wonderful response to the warmth that the countrymen had sent with their happiness.
When I was watching these things, I was surprised to think that he was absorbed in all imaginations.
But, don't realize that we don't feel like this at the time of the Diwali festival.
On the contrary, it seemed as if 125 crore Indians had joined the festival of Deepawali.
Dear countrymen, the kindness, happiness, love and joy that has been transmitted among the soldiers of our armed forces should not be confined to Holi-Deepawali alone
You all are asking me to come, come, come as a society, make it a part of the nature and nature as a nation and we will remember the soldiers of our armed forces in some way or the other in any festival or in any joy.
When the United Nations is united, the strength of the Army will also increase by 125 crore.
A few days ago, the heads of all the villages of Jammu and Kashmir met me.
He was here to attend the Panchayat Convention of Jammu and Kashmir.
Approximately 40-50 chiefs from different villages of the Kashmir Valley were present.
I've been talking for a long time.
While they came to know some claims for the development and development of the village, the recent situation in the Kashmir Valley, the laws and the future of the children came up.
A few days ago, the Board was examined in Kashmir and about 95 of the students were sitting in the examination.
I can clearly feel that our children in Jammu and Kashmir are committed to the development of a bright future through education.
I thank the students not only for their commitment but also their parents, parents, teachers and villagers all over the world.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I asked the public to talk about this time Mann Ki Baat, I acknowledge that everybody has made a single proposal.
Everyone wanted me to tell you a detailed note of Rs.500.
On 8th November, at 8 o'clock in the night, I had spoken of a great campaign for the nation for the right development of the country.
Whenever I had taken this decision and had given you the decision, it was clear that it was not a common decision, it was a difficult step.
At the time of declaring the decision, I warned that the impact of this proposal is so bad that it will take at least 50 days to get out of it and then we will be able to move towards normal conditions.
It is not very easy to recover from the diseases that have spread over seventy years.
The 125 crore Indians are deeply devoted to their country and are fully confident that they are committed to the ultimate development of the country.
This is the reason why we will be able to achieve, whether the bank and the post office workers are working in adversity.
And when humanity comes, they are becoming more active.
When the local bank employees were ears, they immediately reached the house of a younger brother.
Not only this, he has arranged for his treatment.
I am overwhelmed by this incident.
They're taking various ways to save their black money.
One request, do not play with the poor people to fulfill their unjust interests.
Your injustice is being linked to the records of the poor, not after the investigation, these poor people will be distressed, they will suffer.
In order to bring the Benami Asset under, strict rules have been made, which are being implemented in all fields.
I am an ordinary citizen of Harda, Tahsil and Village Trili in Madhya Pradesh.
Your five hundred-a-half thousand notebooks are very commendable.
My request is that through Mann Ki Baat, on the occasion of Mann Ki Baat, the common man has welcomed this step towards the development of the nation even after facing many difficulties.
Thank you sincerely, you said that the day comes but no one could think that you can take such a big step.
By closing the notes of five hundred and thousands, you have taught the corrupt black people.
Every citizen of India has no longer a bigger day than this.
That's why I thank you again.
The media, the common man and the government, when this kind of news is heard, the enthusiasm of working increases.
People have eaten there, and after two-four-six days, when they returned from the territory, they finish the bill.
This is the strength of my country, where service and sacrifice are the mainstream.
The news that I used to meet during the election was spread all over the world.
Many countries of the world have learned the use of the word Tea-Meeting.
But I didn't know that there could be a meeting.
I got the news that there was a marriage in Sura on November 17.
In this marriage, the party had not only organised tea for the invitees, but was not a meal and nutritious event because they lacked cash due to the closure of the note.
During such a marriage, Surat's Bharat has participated in fighting against Maru and Skill Parmar corruption and black money.
Whenever there is a crisis, people find new ways and once I have seen an incident in Dhekiyajuli village of Assam in TV.
The village tea workers and tea workers get weekly wages.
Four neighbours bought together and paid in a note of Rs. 2,000.
You are very well aware that even though the poor people get the minimum amount of money two days ago.
Each municipality tax has only fifty percent of the taxes.
However, after the announcement of eight days, the old note of the people falls into the stairs of the depository.
You will be surprising to know that in the last year, there has been a collection of Rs. 3,500 crore as a tax collection.
We see such multi-disciplinary benefits, which we see.
Brothers and sisters, The villages and farmers are the backbone of our economy.
I would like to specially congratulate the farmers of the country when we are adjusting every citizen due to this change in the economy.
I was calculating this year's crop seeds.
I am happy to see that wheat, pulses or sesame have increased the number of marketing this year as compared to last year.
Farmer brothers have taken a new path in all the adversities.
Some important decisions have been taken by the government, where priority is being given to farmers and villages.
Small businessmen of our country also create employment opportunities and contribute to economic development.
I had taken an important decision in the budget last year for them and the small shops of the villages like the big malls of the city will also be able to do business for twenty-four hours and no law will stop them.
Adequate initiatives have been taken to disburse their loans through Mudra Yojana.
MUDRA Yojana has been provided to all these small businessmen because innumerable people who are associated with this small business have started crores of rupees.
However, due to this decision, all these small businesses are very common.
Download the bank app on your mobile phones.
POS Machine for Credit Card and learn how to do business without note.
You have seen that big malls continue to do business through technology.
In the same way, a small businessman can also deal with a simple User Friendly technology.
There is no possibility of losses in this regard.
I urge you to participate in the creation of Cashless Society.
You can facilitate full banking on mobile phones to promote business and continue business without cash note transactions.
These are technological ways that are safe, safe and fast.
I want you to not only help in achieving this campaign, but also give your leadership and I believe you can lead this change.
I am confident that you will be able to fulfil all business transactions in the village through technology.
I also want to tell the labour brothers and sisters that there is a lot of exploitation on you.
It's written in the paper, a salary and what is being paid in the hands.
Sometimes it was found to be a complete labourer, it was seen that there was a standing outside, it was necessary to divide and labour forcefully accept this absorption as a part of life.
Today, in the new system, we want the bank to have your accounts, your labourer's money will be deposited in the bank so that the minimum wages are supplied.
You should get the full money, nobody cut it.
Today, I would like to talk to young friends in particular.
We say that India is a country where 65 per cent of the population is at the age of thirty-fifteen years.
You, the youth and the youth of my country, I know that my decision has been followed by you.
I also know that you support this decision.
I also know that you will contribute a lot to take this thing forward positively.
But friends, you're my real soldier, real friend.
My brave young men, can you help me
Just stay with me, it won't work.
You have the idea of today's world, it's not an old generation.
It may be that even the elder brothers of your family don't know that Arma-Baba, Kaka-Kakima, Mama-Mami too probably don't know.
You know how the booking of App Kejnis, Online Banking and Online Tickets is done.
This is a very common thing for you and you also use it.
But today the great work that the country wants to do is the Cashless Society.
It's just a hundred percent cashless society is not possible.
But once we can formulate Les Cash Society, the goal of Cashless Societies will not be incomplete.
And I know that you will never despair me because we all want to change the lives of the poor people of Hindustan.
You know how many opportunities are available for cashless society, digital banking or mobile banking today.
Every bank provides online.
Every bank has its own mobile app in Hindustan.
Every bankernies have a wallet.
Walt's white meaning E-Manibag.
There's a lot of cardpaws.
Under the Jan Dhan Yojana, crores of poor families of India have Rupee Ay Card which used to be very low.
Since eight o'clock, there has been an increase of about three hundred in the poor people who have been using the multiplicity of it.
Cards are available on mobile phones as pre-paid cards are available for bankruptcy.
And it's so simple to send your Whats Appearance.
The common features, including the phones available, can also be castronsphere.
Whether it is dusty or vegetables, milk, news papers, tea, gram sellers, everyone can use it unnecessarily.
And I also emphasized the need to simplify this system.
All the banks are involved in it.
My young friends, even after all, there is a whole generation who is unaware of these things.
And you guys, I know very well, this great work is active.
The kind of creative massage you have given in the WhatsApp - Slogans, Poetry, Story, Cartons, New Concepts, Laughter-Chocks - and the creative power of the younger generation in the face of the challenges, it seems as if this India is the specialty of this year that Gita was born during the warfare in some age.
And today, when we are moving through such a big change, then the basic creativity within you is emerging.
But my dear young friends, I am telling you once again, I need your help in this work and I believe you and millions of youngsters of the country will do this thing.
Do one thing, you all promise from today that you yourself will be a part of the Cashless Society.
Use the technologies available online on your mobile phone.
Not only this, every day half an hour, one hour, at least ten families should understand how to use this technology, how to download the apps of your bank and how to spend the money in your account.
Teach the shopkeeper how to do business.
You will voluntarily enter this Cashless Societies and bring out the society from the cycle of this Note. You will have to give the leadership of the great campaign to free the country from corruption, the campaign to free the country from black money, the campaign to free the people from corruption and problems.
I invite you- Come, not just support, but we are the soldiers of this change and let us change.
We will take this fight to free the country from corruption and black money and there are many countries in the world where the younger generation has changed the lifestyle of the nation and it would mean that the changes that the youth and the youngsters have brought to revolution.
M-PESA has set up a mobile system with Kenya entrepreneurship, technology has been used, M-PESA has named and today Africa has taken the perspective of changing the entire business in Kenya.
This country has made a big revolution.
Once again, my youngsters, I am telling you with a strong interest that you will take this mission forward.
I invite every school, college, university, NC-C, NS-S to work in a collective and individual level.
You have seen that Amitabh ji, the most popular artist of this time, is taking the Swachhta Abhiyan forward with a lot of hard work.
My dear countrymen, now through Mann Ki Baat, your thoughts, your ideals and your ideals are reaching MyGov and Narendra Modi App and connecting me with you.
Now the Mann Ki Baat is spread at the time of 11th Belgaum but after the end of this broadcast, it is going to be heard in the regional language.
I am very grateful to Akashwani, this new initiative will provide the opportunity to join the Hindi language everywhere.
Thank you very much
Mann Ki Baat, October 2016
My dear countrymen, my best wishes to all of you on Diwali.
The festival of Diwali is celebrated in every corner of India with enthusiasm and enthusiasm.
India is such a country where festivals are seen in some part of the country for 365 days.
By concluding several traditional festivals, we have easily accepted the changes in the festivals in accordance with the history of time and society.
But in all this, we are able to see a thing well that the entire year in India, the journey of the festival, its depth, its impact on every individual - all these things are linked to one original mantra.
An effort is being made to spread individuals and individuals, to spread their limited thoughts from the periphery society to the end of the year.
And it can be done through this festival.
Sometimes there is a festival of festivals in India, but there is also a feeling of consciousness - a season festival and what should be eaten there.
What kind of crops are being produced by the farmers and how to connect the crops with the festival, what kind of reforms should be taken for the prevention of diseases, all the thoughts of our predecessors have joined the festival in a scientific manner.
Today the world is thinking about the neighbourhood.
Nature's destruction is a matter of concern.
In India, this tradition of festival strengthens the nature love and makes everybody more happy from child to child.
And science has proved that what kind of changes can be made in the waters of the sea in Purnima and Amavasya, there is an impact on the nature and it has an impact on the minds of the people.
That is, till now, our vacations have been associated with science and have remained a tradition of observers.
Today, when we are celebrating Diwali festivals, as I said, every festival of ours is academic and a sense of education.
This festival of Deepawali sends a message to the light from the dark.
Deepawali is the festival of social defect - the light from the shadow of personal defect and the light from the darkness.
We are well aware of this thing that every family has been running Swachhta Abhiyan on the occasion of Diwali, from wealth to wealth or hut for the poor.
Every corner of the house is cleaned.
The government of any place in the world becomes part of the Parliament, the rulers and the Sabdibali festival.
The Prime Minister of Singapore, through Instagram, shared the picture of Diwali celebrations with immense pride all over the world.
The 16 women members of the Singapore Parliament took photographs outside the Parliament after Indian saris and the photographs were spread in the social networking site.
And all this has been done for Deepavali.
Deepawali festival is celebrated in every road in Singapore.
I mean to say that the festival of Deepawali light inspires everyone from the dark to the light.
The news of the accidents, the news of the fire, the news of the deaths and the news of the deaths is very sad.
One more problem is that during Diwali, many people went to Deepawali to celebrate Diwali with all their families.
It's not only a day, it continues for a long time from Govardhan Puja, Bhai Phota, Benefit Panchami to Karthik Purnima.
This festival is a festival which has been running for four days.
But there is a specialty that this festival gives a deep message to the society.
It is said that all the people of the world worship the sun.
Chhat Puja is a festival where the sun is worshipped ascending.
One of these is a big social message.
This is the time of expressing gratitude to all of you for conveying my best wishes to all of you, especially to the countrymen on this occasion.
In the last few months, every soldier of our armed forces has sacrificed everything for our sleep.
In my mind, the sacrifices, serving and hard work of the soldiers of the Armed Forces have had a special impact.
And that is why I feel that this Deepawali is to be dedicated to the security forces.
I have called upon the people of India to participate in a campaign called Sandesh to Solutions.
But today I would like to say that there is no such person in India who has no unlimited love for the country's army, no pride in the army, no pride in the defence forces.
The way people have published it will give strength to the countrymen.
We cannot imagine the soldiers of the security forces. One message of you gives them the strength.
Whether it is the Indo-Tibetan Police, the Assam Rifles, the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, or the Coast Guard, I cannot mention the names of all of us.
When we are adopting Diwali, some of them in the desert, some in the Himalayas, some industries, some are protecting the airports and others are fulfilling the responsibility.
I really want to express my gratitude to the people of the country.
The artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, the artist, some have produced pictures, alphana, cartoons to whom Sarasvati's performance has written the poem.
I can imagine how proud it is for the soldiers of my country.
The message of Sandesh to Solzer's in this hashtag is immense.
Mr. Ashwini Kumar Chauhan has written a poem and I want to read it.
I observe the festival, compassionately, tell you today, this is possible.
My dear countrymen, whose father's house and the mother-in-law's house have been working in the army, Sister Shivani has sent me a telephone message.
Come on, let's hear what this soldier family is saying, "Prime Minister Namaskar, I am Shivani Mohan.
Our armed brothers have been encouraging the Sandesh to Solzer's campaign in this Deepawali.
My family is a soldier family.
My husband is an army officer.
My father and father-in-law were the Army Officers.
This Sandesh has inspired all our army officers and Army Circle on the border.
I would like to say that the army officers and soldiers have to sacrifice their wife and the entire family.
My dear countrymen, it is true that not only the borders on which the army personnel live, but also their awareness in various fields of life is visible.
Whether it is natural calamity or administrative calamities, or to bring back the youth in the wrong way, our brave soldiers are working in patriotism in every field of life.
This discussion shows that some families are unable to build toilets at home due to lack of money.
Vikas Tagore has empowered 57 families with a pocket of Rs. 1,000 from their pocket.
Similarly, Himachal Pradesh has become an open defecation free state.
Nobody goes there easily.
These youngsters walked on their shoulders with bricks, cements and other toilets and reached the forest throughout the day.
More than 150 municipalities and corporations have been declared toilet-free in Gujarat.
Ten districts are also listed in this list.
My dear countrymen, the government plans a lot and if there is a better plan after the first plan then it has to be abolished.
But generally no one looks at this matter.
There is no need for kerosene in the houses that have gas production and electricity in our country.
But who's looking for Artha in the government
I have heard that seven or eight districts have been kerosene-free.
I think the entire state will become very shiggery kerosene-free.
My dear countrymen, Mahatma Gandhi is always the guide of all of us.
What the country will do, how to do, how to do, all his ideas are still considered to be an example.
Gandhiji used to say that whenever you plan, remember the poor and weaker sections of the country and then think that what you are going to do will benefit these people, will they not be harmed
To get rid of the problem, we have to take one step after another.
We have to overcome the distinction between boys and daughters in the society, even though we have an old idea.
This opportunity is an example of distinction in Indian society for our daughters.
Though immunization is done by the government, lakhs of children are left out of the immunization programme and become victims of diseases.
Mission Indradhanush vaccination is a mission which includes children who are evacuated and provides strength to free children from terrible diseases.
The village will be dark in the 21st century, it doesn't happen.
In order to liberate the villages from the base, the campaign to provide electricity to the villages is going on with success.
The work is going on before the scheduled time.
Efforts are being made to free 5 crore families from smoke and this mission is also being carried forward with success.
Small businessmen, small shopkeepers, vegetables, milk vendors, khorakars snatch on the loans made by the Mahajan.
Mudra Yojana, Stand-up Yojana, Jan Dhan Account, all these are a successful campaign to get rid of the beneficiaries.
Financial benefits are being provided directly to the bank through Aadhar Cards and directly to the real beneficiaries.
It is time to get rid of the lives of ordinary people.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, 2019, the great man of this country, who had envisaged the unity of India, who had envisaged and performed the birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October, on the one hand, the birth anniversary of Sardar Saheb, the leading great men of the countrys unity and the death anniversary of Smt. Gandhi.
Sir, you know that 31st October is Sardar Patel's birthday.
Sardar Patel is a person who has given his life to the integrity of his country and I think he has succeeded in this regard.
He has collected all, and we can say the fate of the country or say that Gandhiji was killed on the same day.
And we all know what happened in the country after his death.
Your Majesty, I want to tell you how we can stop such unfortunate accidents.
My dear countrymen, this sorrow is not one.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, a Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, has witnessed the history of this incident, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel has done the great work of uniting the country after Chanakya.
However, it is also sad that the Sardar Saheb had sacrificed his life for unity, had fought for unity and had been the main objective of unity of the country, how many people had become victims of dissatisfaction but never left alone.
However, on the birth anniversary of Sardar, thousands of Sardars and thousands of Sardars have been imprisoned after the death of Smt. Gandhi.
On the birth anniversary of the great men who spent their lives for unity, atrocities on the Sardars and this backdrop of history hurts all of us.
But even in these difficulties, the mantra of unity has to be taken forward.
The unity of diversity is the strength of the country.
There are many languages, nations, dresses, food and diversity. This is the strength of India, the specialty of India.
Every generation has one responsibility, every government has the responsibility, every corner of the country develops the policy of unity and unity.
We should protect ourselves and our country from the concept of discrimination.
Sardar Saheb has given us the Ek Bharat. Our responsibility is to create Shreshtha Bharat.
The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ex-post facto approval to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between India and India.
At present, sometimes we have heard the name of 'Amul'.
Today, the people of India and India are also familiar with every product of Amul.
However, few people know that Doordarshan Sardar Saheb had imagined the creation of a co-operative product.
The Kheda district, which was known by the name of the district at that time, emphasized this idea in 1942 and its real form is the vibrant example of what Sardar Saheb had done for the prosperity and prosperity of the farmers of today.
I pay homage to Sardar Saheb.
On 31st October, wherever we live, I will remember Sardar Saheb, I will take a pledge of unity.
My dear countrymen, after this Diwali, Karthik Purnima is also a part of the light festival.
Guru Nanak, his teachings and teachings show the right direction for the entire humanity, not only for India but for the entire humanity.
This is the message of Guru Nanak, service, truth and everybody.
Peace, unity and harmony was his original mantra.
In every case of Guru Nanak, the campaign to liberate the society from discrimination, blind faith and evil.
I bow down to Guru Nanak on the auspicious Prakash Festival.
My dear countrymen, once again, this Diwali, this Diwali, dedicated to the soldiers of the country, my best wishes to you all.
Your dream, your pledge should be successful in every way.
I convey my best wishes to all of you that your life should be filled with happiness.
My dear countrymen, greet all of you.
A few days ago, we lost eight brave children in the Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir.
I salute all these brave soldiers and pay my homage.
And that's why I will tell my countrymen that day, I will repeat that the culprits will be punished.
My dear countrymen, we have faith in the army.
We are proud of our army.
I would like to talk to the citizens of Kashmir today.
The citizens of Kashmir are well aware of the country's powers.
And those who understand the truth, they have started walking on the path of peace by separating themselves from those powers.
Every mother-son is fast and complete, every school-college.
The farmers also want their fruits and crops to reach all the markets of the country.
And in the last few days, we have started doing business smoothly.
We all know that peace, unity and harmony are the path of our solutions, the path of our progress and the path of our development.
For our future generations, we have to cross new heights of development.
I am confident that we will sit together and find solutions to all the problems, find solutions and build a better way for the future generations of Kashmir together.
It is the responsibility of the administration to protect the citizens of Kashmir.
In order to maintain law and order, the administration has to make some arrangements.
I would like to tell the lawmakers that we have the power, the power, the laws and the rules that are required to maintain laws and regulations, to give the lives of peace and happiness to the citizens of Kashmir.
Sometimes the people of different thoughts from what we think.
I've got the opportunity to know a lot in the social media today.
From every corner of Hindustan, every corner of the people gets the opportunity to know the thoughts of the people and it increases the strength of democracy.
A few days ago, Harsh Vardhan, a student of the eleventh class, sent me a different kind of feeling.
He wrote: "After the Ugreen attack in Uri, I was very disturbed.
In my mind, there was a question of what I can do for the country.
I pledge to read three hours every day.
I will be a eligible citizen who can serve the country.
Brothers and sisters, It is my pleasure for me that in this atmosphere of adversity and in such a young age you can think well.
Then Lal Bahadur Shastriji tried to bring this idea of the country to the entire world.
And he inspired the common man with the mantra of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan and showed how to work for the country.
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji had shown another patriotic exhibition in the voices of bombs and guns.
When Mahatma Gandhi used to conduct the movement, when there was a need to build a frontline movement at the rapid pace, then he used to use this movement with great success to integrate the constructive work within the society.
All of us and the forces should take up their responsibility, the people in the administration should take up their duties and our countrymen should contribute to the spirit of this patriotism in some or the other constructive work then the country will reach new heights.
My dear countrymen, Mr. T.
S.
Karthik has written to me through the Narendra Modi App that all the athletes who went to Para Olympics have created history and their victory in the Jubilee Human Spirit.
You are not only two, you have set up an emotional attachment of every person in the country to the athletes participating in the Para Olympics.
Our perspective vision of Para-Olympics and our sportspersons has completely changed from the perspective of humanity and towards the disabled.
And I'm going to win ourselves. I can't forget this thing of Deepa Master.
When he got the medal, he said, through this medal, I lost the disability.
There is a lot of strength in this thing.
This time in Para Olympics, nineteen athletes including three women from our country participated.
If we compare with other sportspersons, physical capabilities and sports tricks become a big phenomenon - will power, will power.
You will be happy to know and wonder that our sportspersons have won four medals, two gold medals, one silver medal and one medal.
Twelve years later, the Gold medal winner Devendra Jhajharia won the Gold Medal for the second time.
Twelve years of age grows very much, once you get a gold medal, you're hungry.
However, Devendra has shown that the condition of the body has never let his adult become short and he has won the gold medal after twelve years.
He wasn't disabled from birth.
Because of electric shock, he's got a hand off.
You should imagine that the person who received the first gold medal at the age of thirty years and the gold medal at the age of thirty years has done so much in his life.
Mariyappan Thangavelu won a gold medal in the hijamp.
Thangavelu lost his right leg at the age of five.
Poverty couldn't hinder the path of his resolve.
He didn't come from the big city, he didn't even come from the middle class.
In the twenty-four years of life, we have brought medals to the country in the power of determination despite the physical problems.
The name of the athlete is a lot of victory marks.
Varun C.
He won medals in the Bhati Hijamp.
The medals of Para Olympics have been important in our country, in our society, in our society and in our surroundings, these medals have done a great job in transforming our vision towards our disabled brothers and sisters.
Very few people know how the people with disabilities have shown their valour in the Para Olympics.
A few days ago, there was Olympic competition in the same place.
Not only that, I was surprised when I knew that the fourth among the Divyangs who had not received any medal, he was running less than the gold medal for the general warriors and I congratulate all of us once again.
In the coming days, India is moving on the path of formulating a Sucharu scheme for Para-Olympics and its development.
My dear countrymen, I am surprised to have experienced the Navsari of Gujarat last week.
It was a very sensitive moment for me.
The Government of India organised a Mega Campaign for Divyangjans.
There I met a little girl Gaurishardul, she couldn't see her eyes, she came from the far-flung jungles of Dang district.
The Government of India has set up a World Record on the soil of the Government of India, which is very important.
In eight hours, six hundred Divyangs, who could not hear, were successful in providing machines to listen to them.
This incident took place in the Guinness Book of World Records.
It is a matter of pride for our countrymen to establish three world records by Divyangjans in a day.
Dear countrymen, two years ago, on 2nd October, we started the Swachh Bharat Mission on the birth anniversary of the revered Bapu.
On that day, I had said that cleanliness and cleanliness should be our nature and every citizen should be duties and should create a hateful environment towards cleanliness.
On 2nd October, when two years are over, I can say with confidence that awareness of cleanliness has increased in the hearts of 125 crore Indians.
I had said that let's move towards cleanliness and today we can say that everybody has made an effort to move a step forward.
That is, the country has moved towards 125 crore footsteps of cleanliness.
Therefore, everybody could be citizens, rulers, government offices or roadstreams, busdipos or railway stations, schools and colleges, dharamshalas, hospitals-children- the poorest of the villages, the farmers of the villages have contributed to cleanliness.
Friends of the media have also played a positive role in this regard.
I think we still have to move a long way.
In order to stay healthy, to respect the citizens, especially the mothers and sisters, we have to stop the habit of toilets in the open.
And that is why an Open Defecation Free (ODF) i. e.
I had recently visited Gujarat and officials have told me that Porbandar, the birthplace of Mahatma Gandhi, will reach the ODF on October 2 this year.
Congratulations to those who have already succeeded in this objective. Congratulations to those who are trying to achieve success.
My condolences to the countrymen - for the honor of mothers and sisters, for the health of small children, we will free our country from this problem.
Come on, let's pledge and move forward.
I would like to launch a new scheme for young friends who are in the process of technologies today, especially for them.
Everyone has the right to know what the Swachhta Mission is in your city, so the Government of India has given a telephone number 1969.
We know that Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869.
And in 2019, we are going to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
In 1969, you will not only be able to know the data of toilet construction in your city but also apply for new toilets.
You, especially the younger generation, take advantage of this.
The Government of India is also urging the corporate world to move forward and urge the professional youth to sponsor such as those who want to work for cleanliness.
They can be sent to the districts as Swachh Bharat Servants.
And therefore, along with the Swachhta Mission, we have to move forward towards Wasteto Compost.
Chemical fertilizers have been told to buy the compost from Waste.
The farmers who want to go to organic farming should provide necessary fertilizers to them.
Those who improve the health of their land, those who think of soil health, those who have been damaged due to the use of chemical fertilizers, if such fertilizers are required in some quantity then supply them.
Shri Amitabh Bachchan has been a brand Ambassador for this work.
I see that there is always new news about cleanliness.
Once I read the news paper - students of Gujarat Technology University went to 107 villages and started awareness campaigns for toilet construction.
The Government of India has also created a calendar of one year in its different parts.
Every department is focusing on cleanliness for 15 days.
I urge the common citizens to work with the work done by these government departments and if you are associated with it in any way then you will also be involved in this campaign.
It's about 500 cities of over one lakh population.
That is why there is a feeling among the people of every city that we are lagging behind, we will do something good next time.
An atmosphere of competition has been created for cleanliness.
I hope that all citizens will participate in this campaign.
The birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri on 2nd October, 2019.
Two years of Swachh Bharat Mission is being completed.
From Gandhi Jayanti to Deepawali, I urge you to buy something or the other prepared from Khadi.
I would like to urge every family to buy any material of Khadi, which also burns the light of Diwali in the house of the poor.
Though on October 2, Sunday, but as a citizen, can we participate in Swachhta Abhiyan somewhere or the other
You should work hard for at least two hours in the work of cleanliness and share a photo of it in the Narendra Modi App.
If you have a video, you can share it.
Our combined efforts will give strength to this mission, will get a new momentum.
Let us recall Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri and do something good for the country.
Dear countrymen, there is a different joy in donating somebody's life in terms of recognition.
In the last few days, I have also seen that when I had requested to leave the subsidy on gas, the way ordinary people have linked it is an inspirational event in our national life.
Some of the youngsters of our country, small organisations, people of the corporate world, students of the school and some voluntary organisations will celebrate Joy of Giving Week in many cities from October 2 to October 8.
The objective of their campaign will be to connect food items, clothing, etc. to the disadvantaged.
When I was in Gujarat, I saw that our officers went to various families and collected the old games in their homes and gave them all the Anganwaris in the poor settlements.
It's really nice to see the joy of those poor kids.
I feel that the Joy of Giving Week will be celebrated in the cities where the enthusiastic youth will have to inspire and help.
This festival is a festival of donation.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the youngsters who are doing this.
Dear countrymen, today 25th September is the birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and his birth centenary is being celebrated.
How can the poorest of the poor get the benefits of development
He explained his economic thinking in every hand and in every land.
His birth centenary year will be celebrated by the country as the Poverty Welfare Year.
Societies, governments and others have to be focused on how the benefits of development will be benefitted only then we can free the country from poverty.
My dear countrymen, two years ago I started the Mann Ki Baat programme on Vijayadashmi.
The common man of the country is attached to me all the time, which has always been published in Mann Ki Baat.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to all the audience for the kind of enthusiasm and blessings you have given to this event on the completion of two years of Mann Ki Baat.
I also express my gratitude to the Akashwani that they have not only promoted the event but also made every effort to reach the audience in every language.
I express my gratitude to all those people who have written, suggested and published the faults of the government system, All India Radio has prepared special programmes on all these letters and have created a platform to solve the problems of the government employees during the programme.
This is the reason why Mann Ki Baat is not only a speech of 15-20 minutes but also a new medium of social change.
What else can be the reason for anybody's satisfaction
Therefore, I thank all those associated with it for making this institution a success.
My dear countrymen, the festival of Navratri and Durga Puja, Vijayadashmi will start next week.
New night or Durga Puja - this blessing of power must be the blessing of the unity of the society.
There will be festivals to connect with each other.
However, it will be the meditation of real energy and only then will we celebrate the victory festival together.
Come on, bless the power, let's go ahead with the mantra of unity.
Tomorrow, on August 29, the magicians of Hollywood are the birthdays of Dhyanchas.
The day is celebrated in the National Sports Day celebrations across the country.
I pay homage to Dhyanchand ji and also remind you of his contribution.
He played an important role in winning the Gold in the Olympics Hockey of India in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
We all know the name of Bradman.
He spoke of Dhyanchand, He Scores Goals Like runs.
Dhyan Chand ji was a sportsperson's mindset and a living torch of patriotism.
Once at a match in Kolkata, the opposition team hit the sportsperson Dhan Chand ji's head with a hockey stick.
That time the match is over and only 10 minutes remain.
Dhyanchand ji did three rounds in 10 minutes and said, I replaced the injury.
My dear countrymen, whenever the time of Mann Ki Baat comes, there is a lot of suggestions in the MyGov portal or the Narendra Modi App.
Shri Ajit Singh wrote in the Narendra Modi App, Please tell me about his participation in the education and sports of Mann Ki Baat enthusiasts as they have made the country proud by winning medals in the Reo Olympics.
Mr. Shachin wrote to you that now, in Mann Ki Baat, you must mention the work of Sindhu, Sakshi and Deepa.
One of them is North India and one South India, one is eastern India, and one is part of India.
It seems that the daughters of the country have taken the burden of brightening the name of India.
In the MyGov portal, Teachers wrote that we could have done better results in Olympics.
He wrote, Mr. Modi sir, first of all thank you for winning two medals in Rio.
But in this regard, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that what was the best quality of our participation in other competitions
The answer is: No.
And no one else can do well without you.
Similarly, Shri Mansatya Prakash Mehra wrote in the Narendra Modi App, "Mann Ki Baat, we need to focus on additional educational programmes, especially on sports of children and youngsters.
Thousands of people have expressed similar feelings.
There's no way to deny that we couldn't show the results as expected.
In some cases, it has also been decided that our sportspersons have reached the country and have not even reached the sports sector.
And in the medal list, we are only two medals.
However, even if we are well monitored even if we don't get the risk, we will see that India's sportspersons have shown great transparency for the first time in many cases.
Look, in the shooting, our innovation ranked fourth and the medal for a very short time has been lost to him.
In Gymnastics, Deepa worker has performed a very good sportsperson and has won the fourth position and he has won medals in a very short run.
But how can we forget that he is the first Indian woman in Gymnastics who has qualified for Olympics and for Olympics.
Approximately like this happened in Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna shoe.
We've shown good results in the athletics.
After 32 years of excitement, Lalitababar achieved the sports capability in the Track and Field Field Field.
Boxing-Vikash Krishna reached the Jadab uarter, but he couldn't win the medals.
Some sportspersons like Aditi Ashok, Dattu Bhoknal, Atanu Das and others who have performed well.
But my dear countrymen, we have to do a lot more.
If we do what we've done this time, we'll be disappointed again.
I've announced the formation of a committee.
We will take a profound discussion on how sports are being practiced in the world.
We'll make a roadmap of how we can do better.
We have planned the concept of results by 2020, 2024 and 2028.
I would also urge the State Governments to form such a committee and see what we can do in the field of sports.
I would also urge sports-related institutions to do brainstorming indirectly.
Let the State Governments review their own and send their advice.
We will have to prepare all the stakeholders and I am confident that we will be able to achieve 125 crore Indians, 65 percent of the younger generations and the best in the field of sports.
My dear countrymen, Teachers Day on 5th September.
I have spent some time with the students on Teachers' Day for a few years and spent time as a student.
I learn a lot from these little kids.
I have the same kind of Teachers Day on 5th September.
But this time I am going to visit the G-20 Summit and I wish to express this feeling of my mind in Mann Ki Baat today.
As much as Mother's place in life, the teacher's place.
These days, after the Rio Olympics, the Pulela Gopichas are being discussed again and again.
He's a sportsperson right, but we've got how good he's trained.
Today I see Gopichand as an excellent trainer than a sportsperson.
And on Teachers Day, I salute Pulela Gopichand, his devotion to the sports, his souls and his disciples to be happy in his own way.
We always feel the role of teachers in all our lives.
5th September, the President of India, Dr.
On the birth anniversary of Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan ji, the country celebrates this day as Teachers Day.
He always tried to spend his days as a teacher, wherever he didn't reach his life.
Not only this, he always used to say, "Good teachers are the ones whose inner students never lose.
Despite being the President, Dr Radhakrishnan ji has shown this wonderful life to live as a teacher, to save his students.
I sometimes feel that I remember a lot of teachers because they were our ideals in our small villages.
Today, I am happy to say that a teacher who is now the age of ninety years, has come to me in his own hands every month.
If there is a photograph with your teachers, if there is a good incident with your teachers, if there is a message sent to your teachers then you must share it with everyone in the Narendra Modi App.
See, the contribution of teachers in the country is very valuable from the perspective of teachers.
My dear countrymen, Ganesh Festival will be held a few days later.
Lord Ganesh removes all the distresses and we all want our country, our society, our families, all the individuals and their lives.
Whenever we talk about Ganesh Festival, it is natural to remember Lokmanya Tilak's name.
Lokmanya Tilak-e-Ganesh gave a public shape to the festival.
Through Sarva Janganesh Festival, he made this religious festival a festival of national consciousness, a festival of social reform.
Through the Sarva Jan Ganesh Festival, there should be discussions on all the issues affecting the social life so that the society becomes new and new in the midst of the honours organised at this time.
However, the mantra that Lokmanya Tilak had made - Swaraj is the centre of our birth rights.
Today, not only Maharashtra but also Ganesh festivals are celebrated everywhere in the country.
Specially, the youth have started preparations with enthusiasm to celebrate this festival.
Some people were eager to follow the ideas that Lokmanya Tilak had started.
Discussions, Construction Competitions, Appearance Competitions were organized on various subjects.
Everything that affects our society in the beauty of the statues is well depicted.
This massive Ganesh Festival is a public education campaign.
Lokmanya Tilak gave us this inspirational mantra of Swaraj Our Birth Rights.
But now we live in an independent India.
Now we will say that Suraj is our right to this common Ganesh festival.
We will move on the path of Suraj, Suraj will be our basic requirement.
Can't we move forward with this mantra
Come on, I urge you.
Without festivals, our life is impossible, but according to the times, it has to be changed.
This time many people have told me about Ganesh festivals and Durga Puja.
They're particularly worried about the environment.
A person named Shankar Narain Prasan said to me, "Modi ji, through the programme you can tell everyone that they use the Ganesh statue built by the Plaster of Paris without using the Ganesh statue built by the Pushkarni of the village.
Conservation of the environment, protection of rivers and floricultures and conservation of small animals living in water from pollution is the service of God.
Lord Ganesha - Vighanhari.
That's why we don't build such statues.
I don't know how you're gonna take these things to me, but I'm not talking alone, many more are saying it.
Environment friendly Ganesh Festival - this is also a social service.
There's still some time left for Durga Puja.
Now we have to decide that our old families, those who built idols, if they built the idols of Pushkarni or the dust from the river then they will get the opportunity to earn.
And after the festival they will be resurrected and the environment will be saved.
I convey my best wishes to all of you to Ganesh Chaturthi.
My dear countrymen, Bharat Ratna Mother Teresa will be felicitated on 4th September, 2019.
Mother Teresa had served the poor people of India throughout his life.
All the Indians are proud to be proud of this Mother Teresa's 'Sant'.
A delegation of officials led by our Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj will be present on behalf of the Government of India to participate in the event on 4th September.
We can always learn from the saints, sages, sages and great men.
I hope we'll drink new things, keep learning and do good things.
Jan Shakti is considered a form of God.
In the last few days, the Government of India has made a successful effort to connect the common man with the Ganga Safai Abhiyan for clean Ganga in collaboration with five state governments.
The villagers present in Allahabad have taken a pledge to witness the mother Ganga and they will stop the habit of defecating themselves in the open villages. They will continue to run the toilets, do not let the Ganga be there, they will fully contribute to the Ganga sanitation campaign.
I thank all the Ministries and Ministers of the Government of India who have achieved this event.
I also thank the Chief Ministers of the State of Panch who have taken an important step by connecting the people in the Ganga Safai Abhiyan.
This work was done by boys and girls from seven to seventeen years of age.
This letter has had an emotional impact that on the next day when the children came to the school, some parents had written to the school teachers, they would make toilets in the house in a specific day.
A sixteen-year-old girl Mallamma in Koppal district of Karnataka is sitting in Satyagraha against her family.
When the village chief Mohammad Shafi was able to swear for toilets, he spent Rs. 18,000 and built toilets within a week.
The village heads like Shakti and Mohammad Shafi of a girl like Mallamma are really remarkable.
This is Jan Shakti.
My dear countrymen, Swachh Bharat has now become the dream of all Indians.
It's a pledge to anyone.
Some Indians have chosen it as their goal.
The Government of India has thought of making a film with Swachh Bharat for two or three minutes and send this short film to the Government of India.
Detailed details will be available on the website.
The competition will be held and the winners will be awarded on 2nd October on Gandhi Jayanti.
I'm also telling TV channels that you're competitive with such films.
My dear countrymen, India has always been trying to deepen our relations with our neighbours, be it easier and vibrant.
A few days ago, an important event took place, our President Pranab Mukherjee congratulated the Akashwani Mitra Channel in Kolkata.
Now, maybe many people think the President will launch a radio channel
But it's not a common radio channel, it's a very important step.
Our fellow is Bangladesh.
We know that Bangladesh and West Bengal are taking the same cultural traditions even today.
On the one hand, Akashwani Maitri and on the other, Akashwani Betar will exchange various events among themselves, and people from both sides will enjoy the Akashwani Akashwani celebrations.
All India Radio has contributed to peoples contacts.
It was inaugurated by the Honble President.
I would like to thank Bangladesh as well as those who are associated with it.
I convey my best wishes to the friends of Akashwani and they are also playing their role in foreign policy.
Such incidents give new energy, inspire new things, and this is the source of inspiration for the people of the country.
A few days ago, I got a letter that dragged my mind.
A mother of about twenty-five years, who was a retired teacher, wrote this letter.
If not, he used to forbid his name to be published in the letter, I was very keen to tell you all Orname.
In the letter, he wrote, "When you applied for disbursement of gas, I left the subsidy of gas, then I forgot it.
My countrymen, you know your benefits, I tried to send a letter to those who left the gas subsidy, and some of my delegates will be present in that letter.
I'm trying to write more than one crore letters.
Five thousand rupees are not important here, it is important that this mother's emotion and the blessings of crores of mothers and sisters like them help us build the future of our country.
My dear countrymen, last year we were very worried about the fate, but in August this month, we will be suffering from continuous floods.
There have been floods in some parts of the country.
State governments, central governments, local administrative institutions, social institutions and citizens have been able to do so.
But there are some news in these floods that we need to remember.
Those who are trying to create unrest in Kashmir by stepping up these little boys will have to answer these innocent children sometimes.
My dear countrymen, our country is rich in diversity.
Thank you very much today.
I had the opportunity to interact with the young friends of Delhi this morning.
I believe that the atmosphere of enthusiasm and enthusiasm of every young man will spread across the country in the coming days.
We all know that in a few days, the greatest sports Mahakumbh is being organised in the world.
Reo will be reflected in our ears.
Today, in Delhi, the Government of India has organised a huge and beautiful run on Run for Rio, Khelo and Bachao, Sports and Prosperity Hao.
I will do something to encourage our sportspersons, wherever I stay in the coming days.
I will also be with you to encourage our sportspersons as a citizen like 125 crore Indians.
Come, let us all make the efforts of the sportspersons to be proud in the coming days.
Today, when I talk about Rio Olympics, I have written a poetry in a poem Premik-Panjav Central University faculty, Suraj Prakash Upadhyay.
Perhaps there are many more poets who wrote many poems, perhaps somebody writes poetry, do it in every language, but I want to enjoy the poetry that Surajji has taught me.
A young man, Mr. Ankit, reminded me of the death anniversary of President Abdul Kalam ji.
India and the world paid homage to Abdul Kalam Ji on his passing away last week.
Whenever Immediately Kalam ji was named, science, technology, missiles - a powerful India in the future, will be seen in front of us.
And that's why it is written that what is your government doing to realize the dream of Mr. Kalam ji
If we embrace old technologies with research and exploration, then we will remain out of the changing era of this world.
And that is why the government has taken several steps towards science, technology development, research and innovation.
So, I say, Let us innovate. Let us go to research.
And when I say "Let us aim to innovate", AIM means Atal II.
If we have to entrepreneur the next generation, we have to connect with this task.
And that is why the Government of India has taken the initiative to build Atal Tinkering Labs.
If we have a strong and quality laboratory, then an infrastructure has been created for innovation, entrepreneurship, work and delivery of it to a certain goal.
Just as new laboratories are required, the old research centre is also needed to be improved.
We need to find technological solutions to these problems in everyday life.
We have called upon the youngsters to the Atal Grand Challenge, to find technology, research, explore and find out if there is any problem in your eyes.
The Government of India is able to explore new technologies to address our problems and encourage innovators to be rewarded.
I am glad that people are very interested in it.
When we talked about Tinkering Lab, more than thirteen thousand schools used to apply and when we talked about the Incubation Centre, more than four thousand educationists and other institutions were applying.
The State Government and the Central Government are working shoulder to shoulder to shoulder to help the affected people.
Even though there is some problem in the rainy season, everybody's mind gets fascinated in the rainy season because the entire economic picture is at the centre of rain and farming.
Sometimes there is such a disease that we have to deny our life.
However, if we are cautious, be cautious, be cautious to fight the disease, then it is easy to save the bag.
Try to be cautious about cleanliness, be cautious, try to be safe.
Give special attention to the children and there is no misconception that dengue is only in the poor settlement but it is not right.
Dengue spreads first in a happy, prosperous place.
You must have seen a statement in Doordarshan, but sometimes we became sad to work on it.
Dear countrymen towards another issue, I want to draw your sight.
Life is so vibrant, so there is no need to worry for itself.
I'm sick, I think I'm sick, I'm sick, so take some antibiotics.
Immediately get rid of the disease but my dear countrymen, the habit of eating anti-biotics can lead to serious problems.
Perhaps you've got rest for some time, but we should stop eating anti-biotics consulting doctors.
The bacteria that are tuberculosis and malaria are transforming ourselves at a rapid pace so that the efficiency of medicine is destroyed.
It is called anti-biotic registration in doctoral language.
Therefore, antibiotics should be used in accordance with regulations.
You must look at it.
When health is related, I want to add another thing to it.
The mothers who have pregnant mothers in our country think of the loss of their lives sometimes.
In our country, about three crore women are pregnant every year, but some mothers die during childbirth, sometimes mothers die, sometimes children, sometimes mothers and children die.
It is true that the maternal mortality rate has decreased in the last one decade but still it is not possible to save the lives of many pregnant mothers.
No one knows when there is a deficiency of blood during pregnancy, infection during delivery, high blood pressure, unprecedented complications of hard work will destroy his life.
Keeping this in mind, the Government of India has started a new campaign for the past few months - Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan.
As per the campaign, all pregnant women will be tested free of cost at the Government Health Centre on 9th of every month.
Both mothers and children can be saved and I would like to specifically tell women specialists whether you cannot afford free treatment to the poor mothers on the day of the month, on the ninth day.
Isn't my doctor brothers and sisters able to convince the poor for the benefit of the poor for twelve days a year
My dear countrymen, today the whole world is very worried about climate change, global warming and environment.
In the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Lord Krishna also spoke of the trees in the battlefield.
In Geetha, Lord Krishna has said, 'Ashwath: Sarvavrikshanang' that is, I am among all trees.
The Shukracharya policy states that there is no tree like Nasti Maulan Anushadhang, which has no medicinal properties.
The tree that donates, crosses the trees like that.
Therefore, the parents who are talking about their welfare should plant good trees and take care of them like a child.
Whether it is our scripture - Gita or the Sukracharya policy or the festival of discipline of Mahabharata - there are some people of the present generation who have shown this philosophy of science in their own work.
A few days ago, a daughter of Pune is an example of gold. He touched my heart.
On the occasion of the discipline of Mahabharata, it is said that the trees also perform the duty of children and gold has worked in such a way to meet the needs of our parents and the society.
The farmers of Narayanpur village of Punnar Taluk of Maharashtra have made their grandson gold marriage in Maruti Mahatra in a depictive manner.
Other temples can also start the tradition of planting plants instead of prasad in this rainy season.
Currently, in order to build houses in India, we have to import millions of rupees of wood from abroad.
If we plant such trees on the banks of our food, which will be used to build houses, then after 15-20 years you can sell them by cutting them off by government approval.
This can be a new source of your income, and save India from wood imports.
In the last few days, several states have taken several initiatives to facilitate the rainy season and the Government of India has recently passed a CAMPA Act, under this scheme, more than 40,000 crore rupees are being made to plant trees to the states.
Rajasthan has observed a desert state and has taken a pledge to plant 25 lakh saplings.
It's not a small thing to plant 25 lakh plants in Rajasthan.
Those who know the soil of Rajasthan can understand how difficult it is.
Andhra Pradesh also aims to increase the greenery of the state by 50 by 2029.
The Central Government has been running the Green India Mission, the Railways has been making greenery through this scheme.
Gujarat also has a bright sustainability of forest festivals.
This year, Gujarat has observed several schemes namely Amban, Ektavan, Shahid Van as Forest Festival and has been campaigning to plant crores of trees.
I can't mention all the states, but it's commendable.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa a few days ago.
This is my visit to the country and whenever there is a foreign trip, there is talk of diplomaticism, entrepreneurship, security, sometimes Mou is signed.
But I had a pilgrimage to South Africa.
Whenever South Africa is considered, it is very natural to remember Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.
Whenever the words of non-violence, love, forgiveness come in this world, their faces emerge in front of our eyes.
During my visit to South Africa, I went to the Phoenix Settlement, which is known as Sarvodaya, the residence of Mahatma Gandhi.
I was fortunate to travel from Peter Maritzburg station to the train that Mahatma Gandhi had travelled on the train, which had been devised to transform Janaik Mohandas into Mahatma Gandhi in the train accident, but I was fortunate to talk to those great people who have spent their lives for equal rights and equality for all.
Even after doing so much penance, they didn't see anything in their faces, there was no need to get anything else.
The duties that have been spoken in Geetha should be seen in them.
I'll remember that meeting.
There cannot be a big mantra for any society or for any government of equality and equal opportunities.
It is the same way to think of everyone and to think of everyone that leads us to a bright future.
We want a beautiful life, we want a good future for children. Everyone needs different.
Priority can be different, but the path is the same, and the path is development, equality, equal opportunity, equal thinking and thinking of everyone.
Come, let us feel proud of the Indians who have lived in South Africa as well as the basic mantra of our lives.
My dear countrymen, I am grateful to the artist Burma, he made me know about an incident.
Prime Minister, I am telling a artist Burma from Bangalore.
A few days ago, I read in a newspaper that a gentle woman has been deprived of fugitive and oppressive and committed suicide of 11 lakh rupees.
I have a lot of condolences for her family as a woman.
I want to know what you're thinking about this fugitive and geo-mail.
Some people are forced to snatch the money.
This is a new way of synergy through technology, which is spreading all over the world.
As technology has played a major role in economic development, people who use it have also fallen into the field.
You have made a mistake at some time because they are so beautiful to write your letters as if it's real.
Your credit cards, debit cards and your bank accounts are empty through technology.
This is a new kind of cheating, digital cheating.
We have to stay away from this kind of fame, be cautious, and we have to share it with the friends and friends of some such false messages.
Our MPs also bring people from their respective areas, meet me, talk to me and talk to them.
But recently I had a good experience.
Some of Aligarh students had me.
He's got a nice picture at the station.
Not only this, the plastic bottles or oil cane washed in the village, they found out and planted trees and made virtual gardens.
Thus, they have given a new form to the railway station.
If you ever go to Aligarh, you will definitely see the station.
There's a feeling of newness.
This is the example of a change in the participation of the people.
Thanks to those who are doing this thing in the country, especially those who are associated with Aligarh.
My dear countrymen, the season of festivals starts in our country as soon as rain comes.
The fairs will be held at various places in the coming days.
In the temple, festivals will be celebrated at the place of worship and you will also attend the festival at home.
Rakhibandhan is an important festival.
Can you not offer the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or the Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to the mothers and sisters on the occasion of Rakhibandhan this year like last year
My dear countrymen, we have many people who were born after independence.
I am the first Prime Minister of the country who was born in a free India year.
The uit India Movement was launched on 8th August this year, its 75 years and the 15th August is going to be 70 years of independence.
We are enjoying the joy of independence and feeling the pride of being an independent citizen. It is your time to remember those people who brought this freedom.
The 75 years of the uit India Movement and the 70 years of independence can inspire us, inspire us, inculcate innovation and take a pledge to do good for the country.
I hope you too will do something good in the inspiration of indigenous love.
Nowadays, technology has become so cheap that you can voluntarily deliver to me and I invite you to remember the sacred life of the freedom fighters.
Everybody plans a lot during the holiday.
And this holiday is our season... so it's like I'm tasted.
Sometimes it feels like if there is some chance to sleep in the afternoon then it's very good.
But this time the hot hot fun has been snatching all the fun.
It is very simple to worry about the countrymen.
And the water collection is also decreasing.
For this reason, people are very sensitive towards water and there is an effort to do something or the other about water conservation.
A few days ago, somebody was telling me that the Huvere Bazar Gram Panchayat of Ahmedabad district of Maharashtra and its subordinate villagers have given great importance to the needs of water in the villages.
We have decided to give up all the crops like sugarcane, banana, etc.
It's not as easy to hear. It's not easy to hear.
Everyone has made a big pledge together
If a factory uses water and we talk about shutting down the factories because the use of water is more, then you know what will be the result.
It's right that I'm talking about a small village Hybre Bazar, but there are many more villages like this.
I congratulate all the villagers for this kind of good work.
I have been told that the Goraba Gram Panchayat of Devas district of Madhya Pradesh has tried to build agri reservoirs in its efforts.
They built about 27 agricultural reservoirs.
This has led to an increase in the underground water level, water has risen a lot.
I'll tell you, they're more congratulating than the railways.
The nature of the human beings is as much as the day is in danger, if there is a problem then it seems that the danger is cut off.
Since the possibility of 106 per cent of rains, it seems as if there was a message of great peace.
It's too late for rains to come, but the news of good rains has created a new brightness.
The farmers need soil, the crops are used for crops.
Can't we take the soil from the village pond
It will also enhance the field and enhance its water harvesting capacity.
Sometimes in the cement storage, sometimes the water can be stored by putting stones and soil filled in the empty settlements
The water level will grow, the water will come to our well.
So the water must be stored as much as possible.
Rainfall water will remain in the villages and if we do something then it will be possible to work together.
So today the water scarcity is good, the sword is going on, but the next month we have time for 1.5 months.
Shriman Kumar Krishna asked MyGov whether the Ganga Safai Abhiyan would be possible in our lifetime
How many governments have come and how many schemes have been constructed, how many costs have been spent.
And that is why it is very natural to raise this question in the minds of millions of people of the country like brother Kumar Krishna.
The Ganga provides us the power to revive and rejuvenate.
Just as the Ganga flows, it also gives a new flow to the economy of the country.
A Bhagirath brought us the Ganga but it needs crores of Bhagirath to save it.
This work will never be possible without the massive help of the people.
We have to be a change agent for its cleanliness and cleanliness.
Several schemes are underway by the government.
Efforts are being made to take full support from all the states on the banks of the Ganges.
Efforts are being made to connect social and voluntary organizations with unity.
Several steps have been taken to prevent pollution through environmental pollution and factories.
Everyday there is a lot of jungle in the Ganges through drains and drains.
In order to clean this jungle, the trash skimmer starts cleaning the jungle in various places like Varanasi, Allahabad, Kanpur, Patna etc.
All local organisations have been informed and requested that they continue the work and do the work of cleaning the water.
Earlier, I was told that where the effort is done well, it is possible to clean up the jungle from 3 to 11 tons per day.
So it's right that we're capable of cleaning a large quantity of water.
In the next few days, there are plans to set up a Trash Skimmer in some other places.
And an effective plan has been made to control the pollution control of pulps and papers, distillery and Sugar Industries.
The waste infection is almost completely closed from the Pulp and Paper Industry Black Liquor factory.
All these incidents prove that we are moving towards the right goal and awareness has also increased.
People are also providing financial assistance for the cleanliness of the Ganges, which is making this work very well.
My dear countrymen, today is 24th April.
This day is celebrated as 'Panchayeti Raj Diwas' in India.
Today, the Panchayati Raj system was started in our country.
And today the Panchayati Raj system across the country is working successfully as an important sole of our democracy.
On April 24, we celebrated the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar and today, on April 24, the Panchayati Raj Diwas.
This is a beautiful accommodation, the most important part of our Constitution is our village.
He inspired them to work towards connecting the villages with the Constitution.
In this regard, the Bharatodaya Abhiyan was launched on the 10th day of his birthday from April 14 to April 24, 2018.
It is my privilege that on 14th April, I had the opportunity to visit Mahu on the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar and I had the opportunity to bow down to that holy place.
Today, on 24th day, in Jharkhand, where most tribal brothers and sisters are present, I will be celebrating Panchayati Raj Diwas.
I will once again talk to all the Panchayats of the country at 3:00 pm.
This campaign has been a very big awareness.
At the same time, such events have been going on in so many villages of India for ten days.
I congratulate all the state governments and the heads of the village for this.
You have used this opportunity to strengthen democracy for the development and prosperity of the villages in a very basic and new way.
And that is why all of us will give strength to the village Uday as much as possible.
Shermila called from Mumbai to Dharakuda and spoke of her thoughts.
Prime Minister ji Namaskar
I'm telling you Shermila Dharakude from Mumbai.
You have questions about my school and college education.
For example, there has been a need to amend the education sector for the past several years.
Today, if every family has the same dream, then it is the education of children.
Well, we're supposed to talk about the car.
This idea of teaching children in a country like India is a great strength.
I want to enhance this idea of giving good education to the child, and there is a need to be more awareness about this.
Therefore, I would like to urge all parents and parents to discuss the school programme with children for a long time.
And if you feel something, go to school yourself and talk to the teachers.
This surveillance will help us reduce many shortcomings in the education sector.
And it will definitely be possible in all partnerships.
Every government of our country has emphasized on education and they have tried their own ways.
And it is also true that for a long time, we have been focused on educational institutions, education systems, schools and colleges, teachers and children coming to school etc.
We have done a big job in promoting education.
Now we have to focus on quality education.
Good education through literature campaigns should be our main objective.
There was a need for calculation of infrastructure.
Now we need to assess the achievements of education.
Till now, how many teachers have come to the school.
This mantra was filled, filled, filled.
But now the children who have come to school will have to focus on giving good and qualified education to them.
You have seen the budget of the present government.
Efforts are being made to focus on good education.
It's okay, there's a lot of roads left.
However, if we take a decision of 125 crore people then we can cross this path too.
Shermila ji's point of view is to bring about a change in our thoughts.
You must have noticed that some work has been done in the budget by going out of traditional ideas.
In the budget, ten government universities and ten non-governmental universities have been asked to get rid of government bonds and they want to know what challenges they have to face for being the best university.
Indias Universities can compete with other universities in the world, and there is a need to compete.
In addition, education is important as well as skills.
This is why technology will play an important role in the field of education.
Tele-education technology will make our education system easier.
And I believe that I can understand the results in the far future.
Honble Prime Minister, Namaskar
I'm telling the businessman Mina Karnwal.
Today, the youth play an important role in writing and sports.
They need to have a team-by-out mindset and quality of good leadership so that their overall development can be achieved.
I want you to inspire a lot of youngsters and I want the government to encourage the maximum number of NCCs, NSS and India Scouts and Guides.
You have sent me so many proposals that before talking to you, I am willing to talk to NCC, NSS, India Scouts and Guides.
I have organized a meeting on the request and offer of you again and again in which the heads of the NCC, NSS, Scouts and Guide, Red Cross, Nehru Youth Centres were present.
When I asked them when they met before, they told me that they had been present in this kind of meeting for the first time after the independence of the country.
This time I've taken some of these things to them.
I told them, why wouldn't our young friends take part in water harvesting
Something like that happened to them.
I see it as a bright matter among us.
You must have noticed that the political situation in our country has reached such a stage that in the last few elections, there has been a lot of discussions about this thing. How many parties will give gas cylinders
On the other hand, economists spoke of reducing gas subsidy.
Some committees also proposed to reduce gas subsidies.
It's all experienced.
I had said this kind of thing, but today I want to say that I am proud of my countrymen.
One crore families have left the gas subsidies voluntary.
And this one crore family is not rich.
I see some of those who have left the subsidy are retired teachers, retired clerks, farmers, small shopkeepers - such a middle class or lower middle class family.
However, it has been estimated that more than 80 percent of the families who have left the gas subsidies have gone to the distributors and left the gas subsidies with written applications.
My dear countrymen, it's not a small thing.
If the government gives a little exemption on tax, then the government can be appreciated in the weekly TV and newspapers.
In our country, subsidies are considered to be the right to unite.
But one crore families left the subsidy.
First of all, I salute one crore families, congratulations and congratulations because they have forced political leaders to think newly.
The world's economists demonstrate this kind of fiscal demonstration.
Sometimes I think that we announce that today there will be no ticket tester on this railway route.
We can conduct several such tests.
If you believe in the people of the country then you can get hopeful results.
Anyway, it's your own opinion.
It can't be a government rule, but we can create an environment like this.
And this environment is not creating a political leader but a million families of the country have created this environment.
All breaking news is bad news.
Is there nothing good about us in this country of 125 crore population
Please change this situation.
He used to say this again.
A few days ago, he wrote a letter to me on behalf of a news paper that on Monday, they will not print any unnecessary news.
And everyone wants the common man to get the right and good news.
If a well-known person speaks good, selects good words, demonstrates it well, the impact of a better news can be seen more than that.
Good news inspires us to do good.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's gonna reduce the bad place.
If the lamp burns, the darkness will go away, it will be.
Perhaps you know that a website has been opened on behalf of the government - Transforming India - this web site shows an impressive news.
This is not only the government but the common man can send good news to this portal.
You can also participate in it.
Raviji, you gave good advice, but please don't worry about me.
We will all try to work together, try to talk about constructive things, try to reach out to constructive goals.
The specialty of our country is the Kumbh Mela.
The Kumbh Mela can be a center of attraction for tourists.
Very few people of the world are aware that crores of people have been on the banks of the river for so long.
This fair is completed in a peaceful atmosphere.
In an institutional perspective, in the vision of event management, it creates a very big vision in the vision of common man's participation.
Over the past few days, I have seen that some people are uploading pictures of Singhstha Kumbh.
I want the tourism departments of the Government of India and the State Government to organize a competition of these pictures.
And tell the guys to upload good photographs.
He said that we have put special emphasis on cleanliness and cleanliness should not only stop this campus, but they want to take the message of cleanliness from Kumbh Mela.
I believe that this Kumbh Mela is a religious and spiritual fair, but we can make it a social coordination.
I can also build a cultural field.
This can be an opportunity to reach the village of true pledge and true habit.
My dear countrymen, I will meet you once again on this great day of Panchayat Raj and thank you all.
Mann Ki Baat, July 2019
For Mann Ki Baat, there is always awaiting me and from you.
This time too, I have seen a large number of letters, comments, phone calls, many stories, suggestions and inspirations.
I think you're testing me.
In spite of this, I would like to share with you once again on the lines of Mann Ki Baat.
You must remember that last time I had discussed a book on Prem Chand ji's story and we decided that if someone reads a book then you will share something with everyone through the Narendra ModiApp.
I have seen that a large number of people have shared information about various types of books.
I am glad to see that people have discussed books such as science, technology, new innovation, history, culture, business and soul life.
Some people also advised me to talk about some more books.
But I have to acknowledge that now I don't have much time to read books.
But I feel that this experience of the last one month should be taken forward.
I want this book to be an active platform for corners, readers and writers.
Friends, I feel that in Mann Ki Baat, water conservation, I had touched this thing earlier, but today I feel that this water conservation was like touching your hearts before I had said.
I feel that recently this matter of water has dragged the minds of your countrymen.
Several effective efforts are being made in the country for water conservation.
People are sharing information about traditional methods.
Media water conservation has started a lot of innovation.
This will not only prevent land degradation and crop losses but also provide water to the fields.
You all will be happy to know that the beautiful state of the North-East is the Meghalaya, the first state of the country, which has its own policy or water policy.
I congratulate the government there.
There's a lot of fairs at this time.
We can implement these fairs for water conservation.
People from all sections of the society come to the fair.
The news of water conservation will be organized here and we will be able to dramatically reach the festival and water conservation will also be done.
That's why some children are trying to listen to you today.
These are Nidhi Baiputu, Manish Joshi, Devanshi Rawat, Thanush Jain, Harsh Devdharkar, Anant Tewari, Preeti Nag, Atharva Deshmukh, Forest Ganguli and Harik Al-Manda.
You will also be proud of what I will say about them and you will also be proud of it.
We all know that Cancer is a word that fears the whole world.
It looks like death is standing in the corner.
But these ten children have not only defeated the fatal diseases like cancer in the war of life but have illuminated the name of India throughout the world in their lives.
In the field of sports, we often see that a sportsperson becomes a winner after winning or after winning a medal, but this is a rare experience where he became a winner before participating in the competition and that too was in the battle of life.
This month, World Children's Winners Games was held in Moscow.
Shooting, Daba, Swimming, Running, Football, Table Tennel are organized.
Our country has won medals in this tenth edition.
Some of them won medals again.
My dear countrymen, I believe that you have been proud of the success of India in the remote space by skies. Chandrayaan-2.
Sanjay Haripura from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, Mahendra Kumar Daga from Kolkata, P.
Like Aurobindo Rao, many have written the Narendra Modi App and MyGov from different parts of the country and expressed interest in discussing Chandrayaan-2.
In fact, from the point of view of space research, 2019 is a good year for India.
Our scientists launched A-Sat in March and then this Chandrayaan-2.
It was not possible to discuss such big and important news as A-SAT at the time of elections.
In just 3 minutes, the A-Sat missile was capable of hitting 300 kilometres away satellites.
India is the fourth country in the world, which has achieved success in this special sector.
Recently, on 22nd July, the entire country has seen how the Chandrayaan-2 has moved from Sriharikota to the space.
These pictures of the successful launch of Chandrayaan-2 have filled the country with pride, energy and happiness.
Chandrayaan-2 is a special kind of mission.
We should believe in our talent and capabilities.
You will be happy to know that Chandrayaan-2 is an entire Indian initiative.
It's an Indian in mind.
This is a completely indigenous mission.
The way our scientists used to launch Chandrayaan-2 at the time of record, the technological problems at night.
We also face such a temporary setback in our lives.
But always remember that we have the capability to cross this obstacle.
I am confident that this Chandrayaan-2 campaign will inspire the youth of the country towards science and innovation.
This is the final truth that science is the path of development.
We are now keenly waiting for the month of September when two landers Vikram and Rover descend to the moonland.
Today, through Mann Ki Baat, I would like to tell my country's students and my young friends about a charming competition, a competition and invite the youngsters of the country to invite them in a quiz competition.
Asked about space and space, Indias space mission, science and technology are the main subjects of this question. What should be done to launch rockets, how to send a satellite to a room or what can we know from this satellite, A-Satki
I would like to urge my young friends to participate in this quiz competition and make it more reminderable.
This will be a historic event in the lives of those victorious persons, but for that you will have to participate in this quiz competition and get the highest number.
My dear countrymen, you will be watching one thing, our Mann Ki Baat has speeded up the Swachhta Abhiyan at various times.
The efforts that are being made for cleanliness have always inspired Mann Ki Baat.
The journey that started five years ago has set up new parameters of cleanliness in collaboration with everyone.
It is true that we have not yet achieved the ideal situation in the field of cleanliness, but the way the Swachhta Abhiyan has been achieved in public places, it is the result of the will power of 130 crore Indians.
But we don't stop at all.
This movement has now stepped from cleanliness to beauty.
A few days ago, I was watching a news of Mr. Yogesh Sainey and his team in the media.
Yogesh Sainey is an engineer who left the US job to serve Mother India and returned to the country.
A few days ago, he also took over the responsibility of making Delhi a clean and beautiful.
He started beautification with his team from Lodi Garden's Astakud.
Through Street Art, many areas of Delhi are being decorated with beautiful pictures.
From the walls of the Overbridge and the school, when he made the slums and slums beautiful, many more started moving forward and this way it started moving forward.
You will remember how Prayagraj was decorated with street paintings during the Kumbh Mela.
I know that Yogesh Saini and his team played a very big role in this work too.
There are no words in color and lines, but the Ramdhanu emerges with the help of them, its impact is more meaningful than thousands of words.
We continue to observe this beauty among the Swachhta Abhiyans.
In our life, Waste to Wealth, it is very important to create resources from waste.
I mean, we have to move from waste to make gold.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, I read a fascinating statement at MyGov portal.
The statement was from brother Mohammad Aslam, a resident of Sopian district of Jammu and Kashmir.
He said, "Mann Ki Baat is nice to hear the event.
I am happy to note that I have played an active role in organizing the Community Mobility Programme Back to Village in my State of Jammu and Kashmir.
The event was held in June.
I think this event should be organised every three months.
Also, the event should be organized online monitoring.
I think this is the first such event where people had been talking directly to the government.
After reading the message that brother Aslam ji had sent to me, I was keen to know about the Back to Village scheme so I read it in detail and then I felt that it should be told to the entire country.
This is a matter of fact that the people of Kashmir are keen to connect with the roots of development of the country.
They also came to know whether the villagers are providing government services or not.
How can their income be increased
Some more things were added to attract the programme.
Children's Sports Competition was organized under Khelo India Scheme.
The event was distributed to the sports equipment, Manrega project workshop cards and certificates of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Tribes.
Economic Literacy Camp was opened and stalls were given by the Government Departments such as agriculture, horticulture etc.
In this way, this event has become a development festival.
This was the festival of public participation and the festival of public awareness.
The ordinary people of Kashmir were embarrassed in this development festival.
Some officer was so impressed by the warm welcome given to the villagers that they lived in the village for two days.
It is really a matter of great pleasure for the participation of a lot of people in rural enterprises in these areas and to formulate schemes for their own development.
This is a miraculous result of new entrepreneurship and new resolve.
This kind of programmes and peoples participation shows that our brothers and sisters of Kashmir are interested in good governance and the power of progress is always more evident than the strength of the bombers.
Those who want to spread the brink of hatred and stop progress on the path of development, they will never be successful in their hatred experience, it is evident today's light.
My dear countrymen, Shri Dattatreya Ramchandra Bandre, honored with the Gyanpeeth Puraskar, described the form of Shravanmas in a poem in Hodighe Madiga, Agydalgna, Adrag Bhoomi Magna, i. e.
Whenever you look around us in this season, it appears as if the bosses are swimming green sheets.
The festival of love of brothers and sisters is also celebrated at this time.
When the Shravan month is being talked about, you will be happy to know that the most pilgrims have participated in this Amarnath Yatra in the last four years.
More than 3 lakh pilgrims have visited the sacred Amarnath cave from 1st July till now.
More than the pilgrims who participated in this 60-day visit in 2015, this time in 28 days.
For the success of the Amarnath Yatra, I would like to especially compliment the people of Jammu and Kashmir and their hospitality.
Those who have returned from the journey have brought the people of the state with respect and hospitality.
All these things will help in improving tourism in the future.
I have been told that more than 8 lakh pilgrimages have been visiting Kedarnath Dham from the day that four pilgrimages have started in Uttarakhand.
After the huge natural calamity in 2013, such a record number of pilgrims reached there for the first time.
I urge you all to visit all those areas of the country where the beauty and rainy season looks amazing.
To see this beauty of our country and to understand the feelings of the people of our country, tourism and pilgrimage, it seems that there is no greater teacher than this.
I convey my best wishes to all of you that these beautiful and living months of Shravan should introduce new energy, new hope and new zeal amongst you all.
On the other hand, it is a time when there is heavy rains in different parts of the country.
When we saw the TV, on one side the rains all around, the water theith, the traffic jam.
Another picture of rainy season - where joying our farmers, the birds, the waterfalls, the green sheets are flowing, you will have to come out with the family.
Rainfall, freshness and happiness i. e.
My dear countrymen, from where Mann Ki Baat, wherever it stops, it seems to be a difficult task, but at last it is a limit of time.
I'll come back after a month.
I convey my best wishes to everyone on the east.
My young friends, all of you are busy testing now.
Some guys may have ended the test.
Some people are under tension because on one hand tests, T-20 cricket world cups.
Even today, you may be waiting for a match between India and Australia.
Today, India will play with Australia and I extend my best wishes to the sportspersons of two teams.
But fortunately, in the last few decades, we are constantly getting down and we are losing and we are lagging behind.
Now, in 1975, our place has come down so much that we can't dare talk about anything.
Over the entire year, we can create a football-flower environment.
In schools, colleges, in every corner of the country, our younger generations, our school children sweat them.
There are very few people who go abroad, most people go to their own state for a walk of 5-7 days.
Some people go out of the state.
Even earlier, I told you to upload photographs from wherever you go.
We have to take this job forward.
Even now, you can do the same, but now write something with him - not just the phone.
And it is said that A Traveler without observation is a bird without wing.
If you're fond of watching good things, you're gonna have to make a look.
And I'm lucky, I've got a lot of opportunity to travel.
When I wasn't the Chief Minister, I wasn't the Prime Minister, and I was as young as you, I was very roaming around.
Perhaps there is no district in India where I had no opportunity to visit.
Tourism has an important role in creating life.
And now the youth of India are going to tourism with courage and willingness.
I think it's a very good example.
Our younger generations should try to reach the brave place wherever they do not have their feet.
I would like to specially thank Coal India.
Then stay away.
When we look at the pictures of the people there, we think what's the best to go there.
And it's a matter of fact that the hand is black in coal, that's why people go away from mines.
But that coal mine is the tourist destination
And I am glad that till now more than 10,000 people have seen the environment friendly mine tourism centers in the village of Saon near Nagpur.
This place gives you an opportunity to see new things.
I hope that if you go out on a holiday, you can do something about cleanliness.
Perhaps it's not scientific, but it's happening.
Can't you also focus on the cleanliness of the tourism centre as a tourist
I believe that our young friends will definitely help in this matter.
Therefore, there is a lot of employment opportunities for tourism.
India is still far behind tourism as compared to other countries of the world.
But if we believe that if we have to strengthen our tourism then we can definitely attract the entire world.
We can take a big part of the world tourism to ourselves in this way.
And then it will be possible to provide employment to millions of youngsters in our country.
Whether it is a government or an institution or a society or a citizen, all these things have to be done together.
Come on, we do something for that.
My young friends, holidays come like this and go away. I don't like it.
You should also think about this.
Would you like to let your holidays and important years of life go this way
I'm talking about how many things you can think.
Cannot you take the pledge of adding any more qualities to your personality on this holiday
If you don't know the swimming, you can pledge to swim in the holiday.
If you don't know how to drive a cycle, learn to drive a cycle on holidays.
Do something to enhance your personality, your capabilities and efficiency during the holiday.
Not only those areas which I have spoken, but there is more opportunity to work outside them.
You will see how much your personality, your self-confidence will increase.
We'll talk about it among friends.
Some suggestions have been made at MyGov portal for this time Mann Ki Baat.
Like, my name is Abhi Chaturvedi.
I am glad to do this thing and I am friendly with many birds on this occasion.
I urge you to repeat this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
My dear countrymen, I would like to express my gratitude to this child in the name of Abhi Chaturvedi.
He reminded me of a good job.
Absolutely told me, he's doing this all year and many birds have become friends.
Mahadevi Varma, the great poet of Hindi, loved birds.
In his poem, he wrote, "Don't let you go away, fill up the grains, fill the utensils with sweet water.
Come on, let us make this idea of Mahadevi.
I congratulate you and I express my gratitude and you have reminded me of very important things.
From Mysore to Craft Cook has made a very sensitive issue for all of us.
He said, the milky, the news paper, the postman came near our house.
Sometimes the utensils, the garment sellers also go through the same way.
Did we ever ask them to drink their water in the summer
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, you have heard a lot of digital India.
Some people think Digital India is the world of the youth of the city
If you download this app on your mobile phone then you will get a lot of information related to agriculture and weather.
There are many things like market conditions, pickery market conditions, good crop supply, suitable medicines, etc.
And if you put a question in front of them, they will answer and explain to you.
I hope my farmer brothers and sisters will download this Kisan Suvidha App on their mobile phones.
This time is very important for the farmers before the start of agriculture.
Can't we find those old places once again and keep clean so that more water can be stored
This time you might have seen that efforts have been made to build 5 lakh ponds and ponds of agricultural land.
Under the Manrega scheme, emphasis has been laid on creating resources through water conservation.
How to save water from villages and villages, how to save every drop of rain, how to live in the villages, how to launch these awareness campaigns.
You should join various government schemes related to this, so that a mass movement is created for the importance and conservation of water.
There are many villages in the country, there are many progressive farmers, there are many conscious citizens who are doing this thing.
But we have to move forward.
My farmer brothers and sisters, I would like to tell you another thing and a few days ago, the Government of India had organized a big farming fair.
I have seen how many modern technologies have come up and how many changes have brought about in agriculture.
However, these technologies have to reach the farms of the farmers.
And now the farmers are also saying that the use of chemical fertilizers has to be reduced.
I convey my best wishes.
The excessive use of chemical fertilizers has made our earth sick.
But if good spices are given in more quantity, what do you like to eat
Whatever good fertilizers, the extra use of these fertilizers will be a cause of harm.
Everything needs to be used.
It reduces costs, saves money.
I hope that we will be able to complete this work with complete focus on the need for water conservation.
The more the water will be saved, the more the farmers will benefit and the more the lives will be saved.
My dear countrymen, April 7 is the World Health Day.
This year the theme of World Health Day is 'Bit Diabetes'.
Diabetes is such a disease that brings all other diseases.
Once someone has diabetes, many sick guests enter their homes and body.
According to statistics, in 2014, there were 6. 5 crore diabetes patients in our country.
Diabetes is the cause of three percent deaths.
Diabetes is two types - Type 1 and Type 2.
Type 1 is genetic, parents, children are likely to be.
And the reason for Type-II is depression, old age and excess weight.
The theme of World Health Day is Diabetes on 7th.
We all know, the biggest reason for diabetes is our lifestyle.
There's a bit of hard work.
There's no smell of sweat.
It's not walking.
We're playing online.
Nothing's happening in offline.
If you are interested in Yoga, do Yoga.
Otherwise, switch at least.
If every citizen of our country is healthy then our India will be healthy.
And now all the facilities are available to the hands, it becomes very easy.
You must think about it.
The TB Day has emerged on 24th March in the world.
When I was young, I was afraid when I heard the name of TB.
But when Tuberculosis was the cause of death, we were afraid.
But now we don't care for TB.
The number of TB patients in our country is much higher than the world.
If you want to get rid of tuberculosis, we need proper treatment and complete treatment.
If you leave the treatment in the middle, there is a new problem.
Tuberculosis is a disease that everybody knows about, they can also give advice to check up.
This means that it's a disease that needs a quick test.
My dear countrymen, a lot of work is going on in this regard.
There are more than 13,500 microscopy centres and more than 4 lakh DOT providers.
Treat properly and continue to treat until the disease is over.
I would like to urge you, be it tuberculosis or diabetes.
India has to free from these diseases.
But this is not just the government, the doctors, the medicines, unless you come forward.
And that is why I urge the countrymen to come, defeat diabetes and get rid of TB.
My dear countrymen, there are several important days in the month of April, especially on 14th April, the birthday of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar.
His 125th Birth Anniversary is a part of the country.
A Maha of Panchthirtha is his birthplace.
His studies in London, Diksha in Nagpur.
I am fortunate to have the opportunity to visit Mahu, the birthplace of the revered Babasaheb Ambedkar on 14th April this year.
Babasaheb has given us a lot to be a responsible citizen of the country.
Following that path, we can pay homage to him as a responsible citizen of the country.
This festival has been celebrated in different states in different forms.
Some people call it 'Nav Sambotsar', some Gudi-Parba', some people's year-to-people', somebody's 'Ugadi'.
You know, I had said last time that my Mann Ki Baat programme is like your time in almost 20 languages that you can hear your mobile phones at any time.
You just have to make a missed call.
This facility has been just one month and I am glad that about 35 lakh people have benefited from it.
You also write the number - 81908 81908.
I'm saying again, 81908 81908.
I'm glad to be associated with you.
I also want to be your partner in this regard.
I'm so worried about your children's exams.
However, if we change the process of thinking about the tests, then perhaps we can be worried.
I have said in my earlier Mann Ki Baat that you must send your experience and advice to me through the Narendra Modi App.
In this Mann Ki Baat programme, I would like to talk specially to parents, examiners and teachers.
I want to tell you something from what I've heard, what I've read, what I have been told.
I know, the test is going to start in a few days.
How much do you get in the test
I'd like to say that you should set some goals for yourself.
Don't press anyone else's expectation.
You must work, but a realistic and possible goal should be set for yourself and try to touch this goal.
When I played cricket, I had a lot of expectations.
As the time has passed, people's hopes have also increased.
It was very important for me to find a solution.
I thought I would expect myself and set my goals for myself.
And if I set my own goals and fulfil that goal then I can do something good for the country.
And I have always tried to fulfil this goal.
I always had a goal to say and because of this, the goal itself has been fulfilled gradually.
And I believe that God will give you good fruits.
Good luck
Don't be under pressure of hope.
You have to make your future.
You're gonna decide yourself.
Why would I waste your time to compete with others
Why don't I try to break all my own records
Friends, don't think the test is the game.
Life should always be driven by a great goal - a dream should be resolved.
Whether we're walking on the right path or we're moving properly, this test is his hierarchy.
If there is some deficiency in fulfilling the expectations, you will not be disappointed.
Build the mindset of further labour and efforts.
Thousands of people have spoken in my app through mobile phones.
Shrey Gupta said that there is a healthy mind.
Scholars, you're studying and focusing on health so that you can get the tests properly.
However, for 365 days, our daily routine should be favourable to our dreams and resolves.
I agree with Mr. Prabhakar Reddy, he specifically told him to sleep at the right time and asked him to get up and revision.
Prabhakar Reddy said that he should reach the examination centre with Admit Cards and other papers.
I couldn't say this, because I was a little sad about sleeping.
And when I'm talking about sleeping, don't think I'm talking about sleeping for testing.
Don't understand, I'm talking about sleeping to be tense free to get good tests at the time of testing.
Don't do that.
I believe you're not gonna do that.
It is very important to strengthen the foundations of success and synergy in life.
This is the basis of a strong foundation of life that has been created from a sequence.
The stupid and disorder that works in the morning, the lunch work, it feels like the work was done.
That's why you don't think anything small.
Do it right, do it.
Friends, I've sometimes seen the examiners like this.
One, those who read, what they learn, what is good they've got.
Secondly, there are other testators who don't know any questions, what kind of questions will come, what can't be solved.
I have seen these two examinees in a way that the question papers will not be difficult, etc.
There's a lot of exams with Daba games.
When you're playing, you don't know anybody's rice.
If you're calm in work, eat properly, sleep enough, you'll see that your brain can remember the right answer to the right question at the right moment.
Don't be very hopeful, look at it as a challenge, think I can remember what I have learned for the whole year, can I answer these questions
So be calm, sleep well at night, don't be too self-reliant, but don't be negative.
I've seen, your tests are better than you're afraid of the test.
Therefore, be confident and best wishes to you.
Vishwanathan Anand is really an important thing.
His eyes don't turn around.
We have heard that the events of Arjun's life were the eyes of the birds.
In the same way, we have seen Visvanathan Anand, while playing, he has a complete focus on the goals, and that is the peace of his space.
You will not talk to friends - you will be alone, you will be sorry, you will be sorry, you will change the leaves of a lot of books to the end of the moment.
This is why laugh - smile with friends - smile with friends and see that your mind will be calm.
But if the water isn't calm, nothing can be seen.
I feel that if you take a little rest then it would be better. That's why I myself have prepared a method.
Deep breathing - Stay breathing deep.
Let's breathe three-five times.
Sometimes it crosses 30, 40 or 50 seconds, but my mind becomes quiet to understand something.
Maybe it's my experience, but it can help you.
Why don't we see most of the times, we've been following the test, what's right - and what's wrong
If parents are educated at home, they should be teachers, then ask them to write what I have written in the entire account.
We got stuck in it.
Friends, you don't do that.
Whatever happened during the test has been done.
Interact with the people of the family, remember the smile of the day you leave.
Remember the scene if you go somewhere with your parents.
Leaving the exams, he spent half an hour.
In the present context, he is trying to reach the world about the importance of 'Raamcharit Manas'.
The revered Murari Bapu gave several important suggestions to the followers.
And no matter what happens, accept him.
In my experience, we can be mentally happy and happy if we understand the situation.
Without any stress, it will certainly be successful in conducting an exam in the happy mind.
And if you don't succeed, you will not be sorry for failure.
We are grateful for the instruction that revered Muraribabu gave for all of us.
Friends, I want to tell you another thing today.
My mobile app is Shri Atanu Mandal, Shri Kunal Gupta, Shri Sushant Kumar, Shri K.
G.
But friends, if I say that Yoga starts from tomorrow morning, it will be done injustice to you.
However, those who do yoga do not do it today, do not do it.
If you do yoga, you must do it.
If you do not practice Yoga before the test, contact you with a person who knows Yoga, who will tell you some yoga exercises within two to five minutes.
Why do you hurry for this
Make your whole day timeline in such a way that if you stop traffic jams, you can reach timely tests.
Otherwise, such a situation creates anxiety in mind.
And one thing, the kind of guidance that is in the question paper, it seems that the time will be wasted if they read.
I have seen that sometimes after getting the question papers, we cannot understand it, but if the instructions are well read, we can adjust ourselves to it and fix it.
It is very important to understand the questions.
Rao stressed on patience. In a very short term, he advised all the examiners.
That's what I say to my young friends.
Remember, we have a lot of opportunities in our country.
Whatever you need is jealousy, self-sacrifice and empowerment.
With all these qualities, you will be successful in all the tests and efforts.
This is the power of science and the power of scientific mind.
I am grateful to Rao Saheb that he has inspired the children of the country, that is what he has said, that is self-reliance, concentration and hard work.
Please, guys, wait.
If you're supposed to be afraid of fear.
The bright future is waiting for you to do well.
Ruchika Dabus shared his experiences in my app.
We all know about Thomas Alva Adison, the inventor of the electric bulb, and we read about him in our silvas.
However, today the light of that bulb is illuminating the lives of the people. That is why the seeds of success are in failures.
He had no legislative education in the county, no special training.
Harry Potter is popular all over the world today.
But it wasn't like that in the beginning.
How many problems they had to face - how many failures have they come.
Today, the tests are not only students but also the entire family, schools and teachers.
But without the collaboration of parents and teachers, the situation of students is not favourable.
Teachers, parents and senior students have formed a team, united and simplified the test becomes easier.
Shri Keshav Vishnu wrote my app, he complained that parents should not put much pressure on students to get more numbers.
I just have to encourage to be ready.
They're gonna have to think that they're worried.
Vijay Jindal wrote, don't put the burden of your hope on children.
As much as possible, let's fuck them up.
Please don't press.
If he's talking to his friend, don't stop him.
Friends, I am sure that our present lifestyle has changed much more than our older generations.
We want to move forward with science at the same pace.
Friends, I am saying this because today is the National Science Day.
Every year, on February 8, we celebrate National Science Day.
In February 1928, Sir C.
Raman announced his discovery Raman Effect.
He was awarded the award for this discovery.
This is the reason why the day of February was celebrated as the National Science Day.
Generation of science.
Scientific thinking, attraction towards science, creation of new ideas and on the other hand, it is not possible to create new ideas by excluding science and technology.
"I am C.
I bow to Raman and urge all of you to increase the interest in science.
Friends, Sometimes there is a lot of delay in achieving success and when success is achieved then the vision of watching the world changes.
Perhaps because of being busy for testing, you might not have had a lot of news in your mind, but I would like to remind the people of the country that you might have heard that there has been an important discovery in the field of science.
Our scientists have identified gravitational waves in their capabilities.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to all the scientists.
Our scientists will try to take this research forward in the future.
India will also participate in international efforts.
My countrymen, in the last few days, we have taken an important decision.
There are only two places in the world.
India is the third.
I once again thank all the scientists.
My dear countrymen, I am telling you one number, you will be able to hear my Mann Ki Baat from tomorrow by Missed Call.
You will also be able to hear your mother tongue.
Mrs. Call No. 81908 81908, I am saying again - 81908 81908.
Friends, Your test is going on.
I have to test tomorrow.
125 crore Indians will take my test.
February 29, it's Lip Year.
But yes, you must have seen me and you can understand how healthy I am, how self-confidence.
Tomorrow I'll be tested - Parashu will start with you.
If we all succeed, the whole country will be successful.
Thank you very much
This is my last Mann Ki Baat event in 2015.
The next Mann Ki Baat will be in 2016.
A few days ago, we took Christmass, and now we are preparing to welcome the new year.
India is a diverse country.
There are various festivals here.
Sometimes it feels that India is such a country where the economy is connected with festivals.
Festival is the means of employment for the poorest of the society.
I also convey my best wishes to all the people of Christmas and convey my best wishes to the British New Year 2016.
May 2016 bring you all a lot of happiness.
New joy, new hopes and new resolves will reach the heights of new heights.
Whether it is terrorism, global warming, natural calamities, humanitarian threats, poverty is free from everything.
You know I'm using technology completely, I can know a lot of it.
Many went out to spend Christmas' holidays.
All other facilitations in the field of tourism are focused, but he has drawn a special vision and we should have special interest in keeping the tourist destinations clean.
The more clean our tourist destinations will be, the more the pictures of India will be bright in the world.
I welcome Mr. Soleshwarkar's thinking and convey his message to the people of the country.
He has done a new job that has been printed in the newspapers.
So I guess it's gonna get to you.
Dileep Singh Malviya, a resident of a small village, decided that if someone in the village connects the necessary equipment to build toilets, then he would construct a toilet without a labourer.
Considering this thing, he has worked hard in Bhojpura village so far and has constructed 100 toilets so far.
I convey my heartfelt congratulations to Dilip Singh Malviya.
Sometimes we hear desperate things about our country.
As a result of the collective efforts of all people, our country is moving at a rapid pace.
125 crore Indians are moving together and taking the country forward.
We have done all these things, from improving education, new technologies and daily livelihood opportunities, from bringing citizens under insurance protection to banking opportunities, new reforms in the era of doing business internationally and infrastructure development in new businesses.
Credit services have been provided to the people of the ordinary family who could not reach the bank.
When every Indian came to know that the entire world was attracted to Yoga, and when all the countries of the world were united through International Yoga Day, we believed that this is our country, the great India.
When there is such a feeling in our minds, the surprising picture appears in front of our eyes.
Cleanliness is listening to every household.
The participation of people is also increasing.
But I believe that the media will reach these villages and bring the hopes and aspirations of the people there to the entire country.
Therefore, the biggest benefit will be that all the government employees associated with this scheme will be encouraged and happy to think that they have done something that will bring about a big change in the lives of the people of the village.
Is it not necessary to reach the farmers, the poor, the youth, the women and everyone
No government has worked, no government has worked. There is no need to reach the news that they should not be deprived of what they can get.
They must be informed about their own rights.
We should be keen to bring the right and good messages to the people in large numbers.
It's a kind of serving.
I've made a little effort to do this like me.
I can't do everything alone, but I should do what I'm saying.
A common man can download the Narendra Modi app on his mobile phone and contact me.
You should also join this effort like you.
I want to reach 125 crore Indians, it is not possible without your help.
Come, let us all come together and inspire the common man to reach the right to the common man.
My dear young friends, from the Red Fort on August 15, I am Start up in India, stand up.
Since then, every department of the government has spread this thing that India can become a start-up capitol.
There is a desire to have new ideas and new strategies on every aspect because the world cannot move without new innovation.
There are talented youngsters in every corner of India, they need only opportunities.
We will urge all the state governments to take this scheme forward.
On January 16, I will meet you and discuss you in detail, I will be waiting for your advice.
There are crores of people in this country like me who are inspired by the ideals of Swami Vivekananda.
The National Youth Festival was celebrated on the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda from January 12, 1994.
This year, the festival is scheduled to be held from 12th January to 16th January in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.
Can you give me some suggestions about this youth festival
My special request to the young friends is that through the Narendra Modi App you should send your advice directly.
I want to know and understand your mind.
This will be reflected in the National Youth Festival and I will give the right advice and information to my government.
Friends, I look forward to your views on Youth Festival through the Narendra Modi App.
Ahmedabad, Gujarat's visually impaired teacher Dilip Chauhan celebrated the Excellence in India Day in his school.
I have received very encouraging response from the students and they have been motivated to help the physically impaired people in the society.
I think this effort is an important step.
Dileepji, thank you very much.
You're working on this thing yourself.
You are well aware of these problems and you must have faced a lot of problems.
When there is an opportunity to meet such people in the society then there is a lot of feelings in my mind.
As per our thoughts, we express our vision towards their problems.
Some people are victims of accidents.
Again, some people are preying to physical inability.
Several words are being used for enlightenment of these people and there is a lot of thought about such words.
However, it always feels that the use of such words is not right for these people, it is not respectable.
That's exactly what the word has a special significance.
This year, the Government of India has started the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Since I was supposed to be present on the occasion, I had some thoughts about it.
At this time, I felt that God, who has given some incompleteness in his body or whose two organs do not work properly, we call him disabled, we know him in the form of disability.
But sometimes whenever I meet them, I can understand that there is some incompleteness in our eyes but God has given him some extra power.
These are those people who have one or many organs that have divine power, which are not in the body of the common man like us.
I like this word very much.
My appeal to the people of the country, instead of the words of disability, can we propagate the word "Divyang"
On that day we started the 'Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan'.
Physical and virtual - I will try to facilitate the persons with disabilities by developing these two infrastructure.
We need a lot of things like schools, hospitals, government offices or bus terminus, slope roads or ramps at railway stations, ease of parking and lifting, braille script etc.
Allocation is given to gas cylinders in our country.
The government has brought about some changes in this regard.
With the help of Jan Dhan Account, Aadhar Cards etc, the world's largest Largest Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme will provide direct subsidy to the beneficiaries bank accounts.
I am proud to tell the countrymen that it has been ranked in the Guinness Book of World Records for successfully implementing the biggest Direct Benefit Scheme.
This project, known as Pahal, has been successful.
By the end of November, about 15 crore LPGs have been benefitted through the Pahal scheme.
Today, through the MNREGA scheme, employment of rural people is being ensured.
There were several complaints about the funds received from the scheme.
Now, in most of the places, the money is directly reaching the bank account of the workers.
There was a lot of problems with the scholarships of the students. There was a lot of complaints.
This system has also been started for them and it will gradually be taken forward.
40,000 crore has been reached directly to the bank accounts of beneficiaries under various schemes.
According to a general calculation, about 35 to 40 projects have been included in the Direct Benefit Transfer.
My dear countrymen, 26th January is the Republic Day.
It is a matter of happiness that this year the 125th birth anniversary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the Constitution of India.
In order to deliberate upon the Constitution, two days were fixed in the session of Parliament, which is a good experience.
The Constitution has given equal emphasis on duties.
It's a matter of duties while voting, but why don't it be a matter of duties in everyday life
This year, when we are celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar, in front of the day of January 26, what cannot be organized in schools, colleges, villages, towns and other social organisations for organising our primary duties
I had a new feeling in my mind, before January 26, you can write to me in your mother tongue or in English or in Hindi, writing poems.
I want to be aware of your thoughts.
I can send it to my MyGov portal.
I am very keen to learn about the duties of our youth.
I want to have a small proposal.
When we celebrate Republic Day on January 26, cannot we make arrangements to clean and adorn the statues of the great men established in our cities by the citizens and school-college students of the country and to maintain the cleanliness of the reflection related areas
I'm not talking about the government system.
As an ordinary citizen, we are so sad that we are so enthusiastic and emotional about building a statue of these great men.
Can't we make it our common habits for the society, for the country
On 26th January, let us all together look forward to the cleanliness of these statues built in the honor of the great men.
For this, the common man and the citizens have to come forward voluntarily.
My dear countrymen, I once again congratulate you all for the New Year 2016.
Thank you very much
My dear countrymen, Namaskar
With new zeal, business and employment will start.
On the other hand, preparations for Christmas have begun.
Festivals have a different significance in social life.
Sometimes the festival works to remove grief, sometimes it creates a new enthusiasm.
But sometimes whenever there is a problem in the festival then it becomes very painful.
The news of natural misery is coming from everywhere in the world.
There are reports of natural misery that never heard or thought before.
I convey my thoughts and condolences to all these families during these disasters.
The State Government is using all the powers in rescue and relief operations.
The central government always works shoulder to shoulder.
Soon a team of rescue teams of the Government of India went to Tamil Nadu.
I am confident that despite this danger, Tamil Nadu will continue to grow at a rapid pace in the new entrepreneurship and will play its role in taking the country forward.
When these threats are happening all around, the need for prevention is also increasing.
Now his form has changed.
Our Capacity Building is very important in every field.
The government, the scholarly society, the people and all the smaller organisations have to work in a very scientific manner.
I am glad that this initiative has been launched through a dialogue and workshop on a table-tock exercise and excellent programme in Delhi.
You can understand the problems of the farmers not only in biotechnology but also in the field of biotechnology.
It is our nature and generations to burn the roots of crops in this way.
First of all, there was no idea of the losses that could be caused by it. We are doing so.
Secondly, there was no training in what other methods could be.
When the impact of these dangers began to fall upon the city, people began to move against it.
The grief you've expressed is true.
First of all, our farmer brothers and sisters have to be trained properly and they have to understand the truth.
Burning the roots of the crops will save time, labour will be saved, the farm will be ready for the next crop but it is not right.
The roots of crops are very valuable.
It's a bio-fertilizer itself.
We're burning the sweet and destroying it.
Not only this, if these roots are crushed then it can also be animal husbandry.
In order to burn this root, the upper level of agriculture is burning.
The surface of our land burns, which our fertilizers drive the land to death.
And that's why we have to play an important role.
The roots of this crop will be mixed in the land and it will be alright.
If this biological fertilizer is used in the land then it can be doubled.
I had the opportunity to talk to the artists once.
They said a very good experience.
Earlier, when they used to cultivate banana then they used to spend Rs. 5,000 per hectare to clean the root of banana.
If the tracker wasn't available to clean it, the roots would have fallen in the same way.
Some farmers then gave these roots a piece of six or eight inches of measurement to the ground.
Because there is so much water in the root of that banana tree, where it is planted, if there is any tree, tree or crop, it does not require separate water for three months.
The water in the roots of the bananas keeps the crop alive.
The roots that had to spend their money for cleaning are now earning from them.
Our farmer brothers are not less than any scientist.
Dear countrymen, on 3rd December, the entire world will celebrate International Day of Response.
Yesterday, I had talked about organ donation in Mann Ki Baat.
I also spoke of the helpline of NOTO for organ donation.
On 27th November, the National Organ Donation Day has been transformed.
Many dignitaries from the society, including Chitravinetri Ravina Tandon, were present on the occasion.
Organ donation can save very valuable life.
It can bring immortality.
When any part of the body is transplanted from one body to another, it gets a new life and that person also gets a new life.
What else can be greater than this
A national-level competition was organized through the portal in MyGov to create a slogan on Notor Logo, Donor Card and this.
Physical and mentally distressed people have immense courage and ability.
But if we change our vision, change our mindset towards them, then they can become an inspiration for our lives and work.
We're crying even when there's a small problem.
That's why they are the source of inspiration for us.
I compliment them for their unprecedented efforts to fight their lives, their strengths, their way of fighting with their lives and their problems.
I'd like to talk to Jabdah today.
He had to find some parts of kidneys, small intestines and toilets among the terrorists.
The spinal cord was also severely injured.
The ability to stand on his feet ended like him, but Jabd didn't believe in him.
The attacks of the terrorists couldn't repeat him.
A innocent person suffered this way, faced a life-style crisis, but without expressing any kind of anger or anguish, Jabed Ahmed combats these dangers with sensitivity.
This is his biggest psychological determination and he has appointed his life for the service of society.
He has not always been able to empower, but for the last 20 years he has been working for the education of children.
MA has done in social science and is making a silent revolution today as a messenger of the disadvantaged as a social service and conscious citizen.
Can people from every corner of India not get inspiration from the life of caste
On December 3, I will remember his self-interest in the life, penance and human service of Jabed Ahmed.
I am talking about rationalism from time to time, but I know that the lamp of inspiration in every corner of India that gives life a new light, finds new ways.
On 3rd December, all such inspirational people will be remembered.
Our country is a big country.
There are many things in which people depend on the government.
The Government and the Government have relentless linkages with the middle class, the lower middle class, the poor, the dalit, the afflicted, the exploited, the deprived and the underprivileged.
Our country has a network of hope workers.
They do a lot of social work in India.
There's a lot of malaria.
A hope worker from this village, Yamuna Manising has decided that no one of his own villages should die in malaria.
Anyone in the village gets a small fever and goes to that house.
He started treatment on the basis of the preliminary treatment he was taught.
Emphasis on the use of insecticide mosquitoes in every household.
Just as you need to sleep and take care of your child, this hope worker Yamuna Manising has dedicated himself to the entire village to protect the entire village from mosquitoes and has prepared all the villages to prevent malaria.
How many Yamuna Manising is like this.
There are millions of people around us.
We'll try to look at them with respect.
They can become the greatest power of the country.
We have always been a friend of happiness and sadness.
I respect all the aspirational workers through Yamuna Manising.
First of all, Swachh Bharat, second Adarsh Village Parliament and third is health matters.
I urge you to see these e-books.
Not only yourself, but also others.
You might think of reading these things with you.
You must send me to the mygov portal.
A lot of events that don't look at us, but there is a real power for the society.
The right philosophical event is our biggest strength.
I urge you to come and participate in the nation building.
My dear countrymen, the entire world is worried about climate change.
Global warming, climate change is now the most vibrant and vibrant thing and it is being recognized as an index before doing every work.
The temperature of the world should not increase, it should be a matter of concern and responsibility for everyone.
The first way to prevent temperature rise is energy conservation.
Once I had said that at the night of Purnima, the light of the road should be stopped and the light should be saved and the light of the moon should be bathed for hours and hours.
The moon's rays should be felt.
Any friend sent me a link to this kind of scene and I had the opportunity to see it.
A woman named Nurjahana, Kanpur, who cannot be seen on TV that she has got a lot of studies, has done a thing that nobody thought.
He is working to provide electricity to the poor by using solar energy from the sunlight.
He's fighting darkness and brightening his name.
People take the battles in the evening and go back to charge in the morning.
It costs about three to four rupees per day, but there is enough light in the house.
This Nurjahana has recharged these launches through this solar power throughout the day.
Look, the big people of the world are doing a lot for climate change, but a young man feels that he can inspire all of them.
In the same way, it means the world is illuminated by the name of Urdu Jahan.
He's also spreading light.
I would like to congratulate the Honble Prime Minister that he had started a scheme with the Mudra Bank.
Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana is Fund the Unfunded.
However, the speed at which I want to move is yet to come.
Most of the beneficiaries are the TP, TP and other Backward Classes who have worked hard and are trying to run their families with respect.
1971 itself spoke of its own enthusiasm.
I've got a lot of news.
I'm just telling you, there's someone named Shailesh Bhosle in Mumbai.
He got a loan of Rs. 8.5 lakh from the bank through Mudra scheme.
And he started the Carbor Carbor.
I said during my Swachhta Abhiyan this campaign will be a new entrepreneur.
And Shailesh Bhosley showed it to the great shit.
And there was a good business for his family.
But I want this scheme to be more propagated.
May all our banks be more sensitive and help small businesses.
In fact, the economy of the country is driven by them.
Small jobs are the real power of the country's economy.
We want to focus on it.
It's good, but we have to do better.
My dear countrymen, on 31st October, on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel, I had spoken of Ek Bharat, Shrestha Bharat.
There are many things that always create awareness in our social life.
Rashtrayam, Jagryam, Khayam-Internal Visions of the Price of Liberty, that is, the award for freedom will be internal security.
In order to maintain the unity of the country, this Internal Security River has to be maintained.
I would like to take the form of 'One India-Shreshtha Bharat' as a plan and I had also asked for this in the portal.
I've been told that there's a lot of suggestions.
I am told that those who take part in this will be given certificates.
Large awards have also been announced.
I believe your advice will be very useful.
My dear brothers and sisters, the winter is starting.
It's a good time for food and nutrition to wear a lot of dresses.
But I'll say, exercise.
At least for an hour, all the family members should work together, see what kind of awareness will increase and how fresh it will take all day.
Get a good habit in a good season.
Jai Hind
My dear countrymen, greetings to you all
This is the twelfth phase of Mann Ki Baat and it is a year to see it.
I was fortunate to talk to Mann Ki Baat for the first time on 3rd October last year.
Democracy has the greatness of manpower.
I have a basic thinking in my life and that is why I have unwavering faith in my manpower.
Whatever Mann Ki Baat has taught me, what I have understood, what I have experienced, I can tell you that the strength of the people is much more than that.
Our ancestors say that they are part of God.
I can tell the feeling of Mann Ki Baat that our ancestors have a strong strength and a great truth because I have experienced it.
I have asked everyone for Mann Ki Baat but every time I have tried to see or understand two suggestions.
But millions of people are actively suggesting me.
It's a big power in itself.
And so Mann Ki Baat has become a medium of expressing its own thinking of the society.
I once talked about Selfie with Daughter.
And so the whole world was surprised to hear.
However, lakhs of selfies have come from all over the world and daughters have been proud of it.
And when they took away the daughter with selfie, they not only proud of their daughters but also awakened a resolution within themselves.
And when others look at these selfies, everyone feels that they too have to sacrifice sadness towards their daughters.
Millions of people have sent such pictures from every corner of India.
The tourism department of the state government or the central government could not even imagine that there are such precious resources in our country.
It's a little bit like we're buying Khadi's things.
Today, I can say with great pleasure that the sale of Khadi has doubled in the last one year.
And it's not for any official advertisement.
Crores of rupees haven't been spent for this.
It was a belief of Jan Shakti, a feeling.
I had requested the financially affordable people to extradite the subsidy for gas cylinders.
In a TV channel, I saw a widow woman, a retired teacher, a gas cylinder.
The middle class, lower middle class families of the society, who have been distressed to leave subsidy, have also left the benefits of subsidy.
Isn't it a fucking revolution
As much as the government works with the people, he will be able to work as a good driver for the betterment of the society.
The people of my country are trying to convince themselves for the welfare of the country by focusing on every small thing.
On this occasion of Mann Ki Baat, I thought of taking a new effort.
Whether it is Siachen, Kutch or Kamrup or Kanyakumarika from Kashmir, India has no place from where people did not call.
It's my own pleasure.
People from all ages have called.
I heard some phones myself and I liked it.
My entire government will work according to your advice.
They gave full positive suggestions.
Look at the same time, the common man of the country is taking a positive vision and this is a great source of resources for the country.
Perhaps one or two percent of the phones had a serious complaint.
And one thing has come to us, specially capable persons, especially blind persons, have received a lot of phone calls.
One of the reasons for this is that because they don't have the privilege to see TV, they must listen to the radio.
From this, I understand how important the radio is for blind people.
I have got a new direction from these phones and these phones are very important for further sensitivity to the government.
Pawan Acharya has given me a suggestion from Alwar in Rajasthan.
I think everyone should listen to it and people from all over the country should accept it.
Listen to what he wants to say, "My name is Pawan Acharya, I am in Alwar in Rajasthan.
Pawan, I believe that this suggestion will spread in every corner of India at the speed of the wind.
My dear countrymen, I had the opportunity to spend two-three hours with the soldiers of Ganesh Chaturthi.
I have spent time with the soldiers of the Armed Forces, Air Forces and Naval personnel who have been protected by water, land and airways.
What wasn't there - the entire history has been survivors.
The glorious moments of the war, the courage and sacrifices that we have heard of our armed forces, we can achieve this exhibition because we did not find any pictures, even the videography was not possible.
The fight of Haji Peer or the Northern Fighting of the country, the sight of the Chaminda Fight or the Haji Peer Pass win, whatever you see, is a thrilling experience and our soldiers are proud of.
The exhibition will continue for a few days.
I urge you all who live around Delhi to see this exhibition with your family and do not speed up like me.
Look at the strength of democracy, a younger boy orders the Prime Minister, but the younger boy has forgotten to call his name in a hurry.
Cleanliness should be naturalized and appropriate measures should be taken for it.
I also have to hear a lot of things that Modi ji had a big talk about cleanliness, but what is happening till the end
On the other hand, on the one hand, the Parliament and the children of the country are talking about cleanliness.
This movement that has been created with cleanliness, the environment of hatred towards waste and the awareness about cleanliness will also force this government to work for making a Swachh Bharat.
Local Autonomous Organisations - Panchayats, City Panchayats, Corporate Corporations, Municipal Corporations or States or Centre - every institution will have to work in this regard.
And when we celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi in 2019, we will go on the right path to achieve the dream of Mahatma Gandhi.
Do you know what Mahatma Gandhi used to say
Mahatma Gandhi once said that if I like one of these two freedom and cleanliness then I will first like cleanliness and after independence.
Gandhiji was more important than freedom.
Let us all follow Mahatma Gandhi and take some steps to fulfil his wishes.
He wanted to know about the birth centenary of Deendayal ji.
My dear countrymen, the life philosophy of the great men is a source of inspiration.
Sometimes it is historically associated with the name of some great man or the other.
In the coming days, we will remember these great men, we will reach every household their life philosophy and try to learn something or the other from this.
I would like to specifically mention on 2nd October that day, on the birth anniversary of the revered Mahatma Gandhi, I had said last year too, you have different fashion clothes, there are different types of fabrics, there are many other things, but Khadi should be a special place.
And that's why in this Deepawali, we will surely put a place in our house, wear dresses.
And look, last time the sale of dress was doubled.
How poor people have benefited.
The work that the government cannot spend lakhs of rupees through advertising has been possible with the help of you people.
This is Jan Shakti and that is why I once again urge you to do this thing.
Dear countrymen, one thing has filled my heart with happiness.
I want you to be a part of this joy.
I went to Kolkata in May and some of the family members of Subhash Chandra Bose came to meet me.
His brother-in-law Chandra Bose made all the arrangements.
There was an opportunity to spend some time with the people of Subhash Babu's family.
You can imagine how pleasant it is for me.
Perhaps all of them will come to the Prime Minister's residence for the first time.
However, the most happy thing for me is that I have never got the opportunity to host such a hospitality in the Prime Minister's residence in October.
More than 50 members of the family of Subhash Babu, who live in different countries, are all coming.
Bhargavi has sent me a message in Kande, the way of his words, the voice of his words, I think he's going to be a leader or a leader.
He said, "My name is Bhargavi Kande.
I would like to urge the Prime Minister to make the youth aware of the registration of voters, which will enhance the participation of the youth in the coming days and will contribute significantly to the formation and management of the government in the future.
Thank you, Shri Bhargavi has said in the electoral roll.
The destiny of every voter in democracy and this awareness is increasing gradually.
A few years ago, we have seen that the Election Commission was only conducting the election process but there has been a major change in the last few years.
Today, our Election Commission is not only working as an assistant, has become a voter friend and all their thinking is the centre of all the schemes.
But only the Election Commission will work, it won't go.
I hope that if the youth of the country do not register their names in the electoral roll, they will definitely register and vote.
On the day of the election, I say, "Don't vote in the elections, then drink water".
It's a sacred duty, everyone should do it.
Yesterday, I came to Kashi.
Several people have met, many events have been held, many have met, but I want to tell you about two children.
But at such a young age, his interest in psychology has surprised me.
I think he's reading a lot, surfing the Internet, and learning about the new use of science.
He was talking about how relief could be achieved from the railway accidents, how to reduce the cost of energy, how to feel the robot.
A small balloon called Sonmpatel.
Sonam's age is nine.
I was surprised, the whole Geetha was the girl's favourite, but the most important thing is, when I asked him, he was slaughtering in English, explaining the shloka, and listening to Hindi as well.
I asked her father to ask, she's been doing this for five years.
I asked him about his studies, did he just read Geetha and do anything else
The gentleman said, "No Sonamyadi's readings ends once in the evening, and if history is read, then it's in the evening.
They're astonished about the girl. He's just the only one in the family.
I'm really impressed.
Sometimes there's a fun of being a celebrity among children... that's nothing in Sonam.
I think God has given it a special power.
Sandeep ji, what else will you do with me
I have to make a lot of efforts to make this event once a month.
Sometimes our friends of Akashwani have to wait for me for half an hour and half an hour.
A year of Mann Ki Baat was completed.
You know how much Subhashbabu used to use the radio
He started broadcasting his radio from Germany and used to tell the people of India about the freedom movement through radio.
He launched Azad Hind Radio with a weekly news bulletin.
This radio was broadcast in English, Hindi, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushtu, Malayalam etc.
Listen to you, think of you, think of your proposals, and it opens my thoughts, which reaches you through aeroplanes.
I say, but it's your point, and it's my satisfaction.
Once again, I got the opportunity to come amongst you to Mann Ki Baat.
Far away from the people of South India are celebrating ONAM Festival and yesterday the whole country has celebrated the holy Rakhibandhan Festival.
The Government of India has started several new schemes including social security for the common man.
I am glad that many people have come under this scheme in a short span of time.
I had a small request that on the occasion of Rakhibandhan, our sisters should be given such a security scheme.
I have got a lot of information from which it is understood that since the beginning of the scheme, 11 crore families have been associated with it.
I am also told that about half of the benefits have been received by mothers and sisters.
Today, when I talk to you, a year ago, the Jan Dhan Yojana was taken up.
Several questions were raised that the work that didn't take place in sixty years would be so short
This has helped the youth of the country.
You will be happy to know that in this year, 1,31,000 Financial Literacy Camps have been opened to gather the banking sector, the economy and the lower classes.
This belief is that the poor people can get money from the bank.
I once again thank all those associated with this and appeal to the poorest of the poor brothers and sisters who have opened the bank accounts.
This bank is yours, you don't leave it anymore.
I've brought it to you, and you have the responsibility to hold it now.
We have to keep our accounts in the bank.
I have full faith, you're gonna keep it.
A few days ago, Gujarat's violent activity was disturbing the entire country.
And it is natural that if something happens in the states of Gandhi and Sardar Patel, then the whole country feels sorry.
But in a short span of time the people of Gujarat and my brothers and sisters have taken care of the situation.
They have played an active role in preventing uncomfortable situations and Gujarat has again taken the path of peace.
This path of peace, unity and brotherhood has to be done on our shoulders for the right path and development.
Prosperity is our solution to all our problems.
Recently, I had the opportunity to meet and listen to the scholars of Sufi Dhara.
I am sure, this experience of listening to them is like a musical experience in my ear.
The words of those pundits have been used to talk to them, that is, the tradition of peaceful generosity in the Sufi stream should reach me like a musical rhythm.
I'm very good.
Perhaps this true form of Islam is the most needed to reach the copper world.
I believe that this love and generosity of the Sufi tradition will reach far and wide so that the entire humanity and Islam will benefit.
I also say to others, we must understand the Sufi thinking, even though we are different communities.
In the coming days, I am going to have another opportunity and I am fortunate to be fortunate to get this invitation.
The scholars of Buddhist religions from many countries of the world are coming to Buddha Gaya in India and they will discuss various issues related to humanity all over the world.
I am glad that these scholars have invited me there too.
The first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru, visited Buddha Gaya.
This is a moment of joy for me to meet all the powerful people of the world.
My dear farmer brothers and sisters, I once again want to talk to you specially.
I have already spoken about this thing in Mann Ki Baat.
You have heard this thing in Parliament, in the public meeting or in the Mann Ki Baat programme.
Every time I am telling you that the government's minds are open about the dispute over land acquisition law.
I have agreed to take any suggestions for the welfare of the farmers.
But today I want to tell the farmer brothers and sisters that the proposal to amend the Land Acquisition Act has come from the state.
But I have seen that there has been a lot of misconceptions about this, the farmers have been afraid of it.
My farmer brothers and sisters, our farmers will never be able to misconception and fear will never be found.
I don't want to give anyone an opportunity to misunderstand or fear the farmers.
I have every demand of the country, but the demand of farmers is very important among them.
I'm sure, let this term be over.
I mean, the position before my government was formed came back.
But one of them was incomplete.
There were 13 such things, whose work was about to be completed within a year and that's why we had brought them to the Ordinance, but it was incomplete after this dispute.
We are the mantra of our path to the welfare of the poor and the farmers of the village.
So, on 15th August, I had said that not only the Department of Agriculture but also the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare will be created.
We're trying to transform this decision quickly.
My farmer brothers and sisters, there is no reason for misleading anymore.
If someone tries to scare you, you won't be afraid.
I have to say another thing.
Two days ago, the war of 1974 was completed fifty years.
Whenever there is talk of the war in 1970, it is very natural to remember Lal Bahadur Shastri.
It is also very natural to remember the Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Mantra.
It is very natural to remember the sacrifices of those who have been martyred for the pride and respect of the Tricoloured National Flag of India.
I salute all those associated with India Vijay of 65 and salute the brave martyrs.
Such historical events inspire us forever.
I am very happy that India is doing well in various fields of science.
Our scientists are really doing a good job.
I have seen the new dreams of young scientists speaking with zeal and enthusiasm.
In the last Mann Ki Baat programme, I had said that our ancestors should move forward towards science.
After this discussion with the scientists, I felt that there is a lot of opportunities and potential in this field.
I feel good that in just fifteen days, the government has started working on this thing in a short span of time.
Instructions are being issued and it is expected that the interview system will be removed for small jobs.
Edeng has visited India from many countries of the world.
In order to reduce the maternal and child mortality, 24 countries of the world together agreed on the Cal to Action Plan of India.
This is the first time in any other country outside the US.
It is true that even today, every year about 50,000 mothers and about 30 lakh children die during or after delivery.
It's too worrying and scared.
Though there has been a lot of improvement in this regard, India has started admiration at the international level, yet this number is not less.
As we have got rid of polio, mother and child tetanus have also got rid of death.
The whole world has recognized it.
But we still have to save mothers and children.
Brothers and sisters, Dengue is getting a lot of news.
It's true that dengue is dangerous, but it's easy to get rid of dengue.
It has a direct link with the Swachh Bharat I talk about.
We see a publication on the TV about dengue, news papers are printed, but we don't mind it.
There are rules to keep the small things clean, keep the water clean.
There is a lot of public education in this regard but we don't pay attention to it.
Sometimes it feels like we are in a very clean house, very good arrangement, but I don't think that I invite Dengue to the water that is stored in my own house.
I will urge everyone not to let death come so easily.
Life is very precious.
The sadness of the dirty stored water around will be the cause of death, it's not right.
There are about 514 centres across the country for dengue testing without money.
It is very important to test deaths in time.
Your cooperation in this regard is very good.
Cleanliness has to be of great importance.
Now there will be several festivals across the country from Rakhibandhan to Deepawali.
You will see that this method of cleanliness will become your habit.
My dear countrymen, today I want to hear the news of happiness.
I often say that now we do not have the privilege of giving life to our country but it is the privilege of saving the country.
Two young brothers of my country, two brothers of Nasik of Maharashtra, Dr.
Jitendra Mahajan and Dr.
Mahendra Mahajan has a strong desire to serve the tribals of the country.
These two brothers have enhanced the pride of India.
There is a cycle race in America, Race Access America, which is very difficult.
I convey my best wishes, thanks and congratulations to these two brothers.
I am very happy that these two brothers have achieved the objectives of the Team India Vision for Tribals that are working for the betterment of the tribals.
See how everybody is trying to take the country forward at a personal level.
When you hear these things, the heart swells proudly.
Sometimes, we have done injustice to the new generation after being conscious of old thoughts.
The older generations believe that the new generations don't know anything and this idea has been going on for centuries.
I have joined many youngsters who have killed Sunday on Cycle in their lives.
Some people say that I celebrate Cycle Day a week.
It is also very useful for my health and environmental protection.
And I like to think that young man.
Now, in many cities of our country, cycle is being run and there is a lot of encouraging cycle drivers.
This is a good effort to protect the environment and improve the health of the country.
Today, when two youngsters of my country have flagged off the national flag of the country in the United States, I like to mention the path of thinking and thinking of the youth of India.
I would like to congratulate the Government of Maharashtra today.
The work of building a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar in the land of Indu Mill in Mumbai has been stuck for a long time.
With this, we bought Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar's house at King Henry Road, 10, London.
The Government of Maharashtra will construct a memorial of Babasaheb Ambedkar.
This place of London will be an inspiration for Indians who travel around the world.
I congratulate the two efforts of the Maharashtra government for honouring Babasaheb Ambedkar. I am proud that I congratulate them.
This year it's very good for the rainy season.
Our farmer brothers and sisters will help in fertilizer treatment.
I'm very pleased to remember another happy news.
There is a lot of shortage of pulses and oilseeds in our country.
We need pulses for the poor, we need a little oil for the food.
I am happy to note that the crops that have been produced have increased by about 50 and the amount of pulses in oilseeds has increased by about 33.
My dear countrymen, the 26th of July is marked as Kargil Vijay Diwas in our history.
The closer the relationship of the farmers with the land of the country is the soldiers of our country.
The war of Kargil was not only on the borders of the country but every city of India, every village of India was associated with this war.
This war is also fought by those mothers and sisters who were fighting against the enemies in the young boys or brothers of Kargil.
Today, India is able to talk to them all over the world for their sacrifice.
I am glad to see about 2 crore people have seen MyGov portals by doing this thing after a year.
Why shouldn't the reservation be kept for the constrained persons while booking the train tickets through the website of RCTC
Now this thing is very small, but the government has never thought about it or had no discussions.
However, this belief of Bhai Akhilesh Vajpayee has been considered by the government with utmost importance and today this system has been started for our deprived brothers and sisters.
Today, the people who are being constructed, the tag lines are being constructed, the plans are being formulated, the policy is being formulated - Mygov portal has a positive opinion about all these things.
There is a feeling of fresh air flowing in the governance system.
It feels a new consciousness.
There are several suggestions on the Edeng MyGov portal about what I should say on August 15.
Suchita Raghavchari sent a lot of opinions from Chennai.
You can send to MyGov portal, write a letter in Akashwani and write a letter to the Prime Minister's Office.
Look, I believe it's a good thing that on 15th August, I got advice from the people and the people for my speech.
I believe you must send good advice.
Just two days ago, I saw an accident in Delhi and after the accident, a scooter driver has been shaking for 10 minutes.
He didn't get any help
And when you look at the statistics, the mind gets distressed.
There is an accident in our country every minute.
For accidents, one death occurs every 4 minutes for road accidents.
The biggest concern is that one-third of all these dead are young men from 15 to 25 years of age and one death can destroy the entire family.
They should do whatever the administration should do, but I would like to urge the mother-in-law, your child-to-hoiler, or for-hoiler, all efforts should be made by the family.
Sometimes I see, it's written behind the autorickshaw, "Papa should come home quickly" (Baba back to home hurriedly) How sympathetic is this writing
And that is why I am saying that the government has taken several new initiatives in this regard - be it education for road safety or be it the technicians of road construction, administrative system or be it the emergency treatment of the injured after the accident, we will bring the road transport and security bill.
In the coming days, I am thinking of taking some important steps to use the National Road Safety Policy and Road Safety Action Plan.
I have undertaken another project from Gurgaon, Jaipur and Vadodara to Mumbai, Ranchi, Rangaon and Mondiar highways.
I am thinking of a cashless treatment system for the first 50 hours after the accident. Whether the injured person has the money, who will pay, who will not give it, who will not give it.
I have arranged a toll-free number 1033 to provide news of the accidents across the country, an ambulance has been made.
Sometimes I say that employees are employed.
In the last few days, I'd like to tell you what I like.
Vijay Bishwal showed how to connect his interest, his own entrepreneurship and his capabilities with his work.
In the coming days, there can be discussions and discussions on the pictures of Vijay Bishwal.
I remember another thing that the entire team of government officials of Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has started a work in the entire district which has touched my heart and I liked their work.
And they have taken the responsibility of providing toilets to their sisters in the Rakhibandhan Festival so that any mother and sister of the entire district should not go to open defecation.
I knew this kind of news that I wanted to share with you.
There is a small village named Keshla in Rajnand village of Chhattisgarh.
The people of this village have been campaigning for toilets in the last few months.
Now no person in this village has to defecate in the open.
After the completion of toilets, the people of the entire village have celebrated a big festival on this occasion.
This is a great example of how the values of the society are changing, how the mental needs of the people are changing, how the citizens of the country are moving forward.
Guwahati's confidence detail about North-Eastern India has written to me that the people of North-Eastern India are very active in their work.
They're writing a lot. It's a good thing.
I am happy to tell them today that there is a separate ministry for Northeast India.
When Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji was the Prime Minister, a separate ministry called the Development of North-East Region (D-O-N-E-R) was formed.
After the formation of our government, our Donor Department has taken an important decision that development of North-Eastern India is not possible by sitting in Delhi.
Together, everyone decided that a team of officers of the Government of India will go to the States of North-Eastern India such as Nagaland, Manipur, Arunachal, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim and will be camping for seven days.
The effort to go away from Delhi to the east, which I am calling the Act East Policy, should be taken forward.
My dear countrymen, we are happy with the success of the Mercenary Mission and we are also proud.
In the last few days, Indias PSLV C28 has successfully launched five Kingdom satellites.
All these news come for a few moments and goes back.
We don't usually remember these.
But sometimes think that when we talk to the younger generation and know what they want to do in the future, one hundred students are found to be scientists who say that I want to be scientists.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development of the Government of India has launched a National Intellectual Research Campaign to explore new talent.
Now we have to go to another village even if we charge the mobile.
All the facilities available in the city should be available in the villages.
That is why we have started Deendayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Programme.
But we have to do more for the poor.
We'll complete it.
I've started it, I'll finish it, I'm keen to talk about it today.
On the one hand, the month of August-September festival is part of our country.
There's a lot of festivals.
My best wishes to you all.
You must send your advice for the 15th of August.
Your opinion will be very useful for me.
Thank you innumerable
When I said, I didn't think, I'd be able to get such a remarkable step.
Millions of people have posted photographs in Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
I saw one photo after another, how many diversities are in India - architecture, art, nature, waterfalls, mountains, rivers, seas - how much
I believe that you people have done the big thing that the Government of India cannot think about for tourism.
Some more pictures I'm so nice that I've retweeted myself.
I think that if the photographs of the Belum Cave of Andhra Pradesh were not posted then we couldn't even know the places hidden in our country.
But the scene we saw on 21st June is very wonderful and I think there was no such country where the sun has reached the world where Yoga has not been welcomed by exercise.
I can assert that the sun does not die in the world of Yoga.
It is a matter of pride for every Indian that the people of the world have respected and selfished Yoga.
I'm very happy.
To the people of France, the Sin River and the Eiffel Tower are a symbol of pride and they have given equal respect to Yoga for Yoga.
People have practiced Yoga in Times Square in New York.
As Australia speaks of Scientific, the Opera House's picture is dragged in front of the eyes.
The Australian citizens have practiced Yoga in Opera House and have given equal respect to Yoga as Opera House.
Whether it is North America or Silicon Valley or Dumo Cathedral of Milan, Yoga has made us proud everywhere.
I am very happy when the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban-ki-Mun, had practiced Yoga as the Chief of the United Nations on 21st June.
Similarly, members of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force have performed very beautiful Yoga practices.
In Siachen of India, our army has joined the white ice sheets and our naval personnel have participated in the Yoga programme wherever our naval was in the sea.
In Delhi, Yoga has been ranked in the Guinness of World Records.
It seemed that from everywhere in the world, a new question - a new joy - a new zeal - a new unity is emerging.
A few days ago, when I used to tweet a photograph of a younger family in Vietnam, the photograph was so beautiful that it was appreciated all over the world.
Wives, children and elders, villages and cities, developed and developing countries have joined themselves with Yoga.
Yoga is indeed binding the whole world in a way.
I don't know how the scholars and disciples will see this incident but I am feeling a thing that every Indian can be proud that the whole world is keen to know India.
Everyone's interest has increased to know India.
The world wants to know Indias values, traditions and heritage.
The responsibility of all of us is to keep this legacy unprecedented.
If we are proud of our heritage, we can do this thing.
Sometimes sometimes we know that we don't see any innovation among them like our family values, we don't know that our family values are important for the people of the world.
Why don't we introduce our family traditions and values to the world
I believe the world will be surprised - I will be surprised to believe that there are many best things that the ancestors have given us the rights of the world.
The success of International Day of Yoga has brought a new responsibility with happiness and satisfaction.
We have the responsibility of providing good Yoga teachers to the world.
I am confident that you can create a database on where you can learn Yoga and where you can learn Yoga.
I have seen the events of the past in another sight and the government is working, the government is working very active and if the goal is stable then we have seen the results of it.
When despair was snatched around us, as we used to hear a year ago, nothing will happen - nothing will happen.
The government has a department of AYUSH.
Nobody gave any importance to this
However, on the day of Yoga Day, these smaller sections have led and have organized such a big event all over the world.
If the goal is fixed then the smaller sections can work well.
A few days ago, the world has seen how our people saved people from Yemen.
In a few hours, Indians have moved to help in reaching Nepal.
If the government is active, the employees of all the banks come forward to open the Jan Dhan Account in the bank and in a few days millions of Indians get connected to the bank.
On 15th August, I had requested all the schools to build toilets in the Red Fort and said that we will have to complete this work by next 15th August.
It was a great valour to fulfil the work that was not possible in sixty years.
That is, the government, the common man, the government employees and everyone wants to work for the country.
Last month, I started three Jan Suraksha Yojanas from Kolkata.
In such a short span of time, more than 10 crore people have been associated with the Jan Suraksha Yojana, even though we have to take this scheme forward.
The next month is the festival of Rakhibandhan.
Cannot all of us contribute to the welfare of our mothers and sisters by creating a strong mass movement before this festival
On the occasion of Rakhibandhan, it can be a very big gift for brother's sister.
When I come to Mann Ki Baat, many people sent me advice.
Many people have advised me to talk about the rains.
Yogesh Dandekar from Nagpur, Harshvardhan Mahasai from Mysore, Praveen Nadkarni Mahasai, Divyashu Gupta Mahasai everybody told me about the rain in Mann Ki Baat.
This season gives you great pleasure.
The people of any age want to enjoy the first rainwater.
You must also enjoy hot tea with hot potatoes, fried vegetables and potatoes in this rainy season.
As the sun rays give us life force, rain gives us energy.
Point point water is very valuable.
As a citizen, as a people of the society, we have to create a habit of saving water from the point of view.
The water of the villages and the water of the city should be in the cities. This should be our resolve.
Rain water harvesting is not a new thing, it has been going on for centuries.
Check dam, watershed development, small ponds, small ponds of farms, whatever it is, we have to keep the point of water conserved.
The port is on the banks of the sea, so for sweet water, rain water was collected and kept in the house.
At that time, such efforts were made to conserve rain water.
We can do that too.
And I'm giving a suggestion that comes from my direct and successful experience.
It's a whole rural technologies.
When you plant trees then put an old dust on the tree and fill it with water.
We'll be filled with water once a month.
See, this tree will grow very quickly and become very strong.
I'll tell the farmers, you don't roam around your fields and plant trees.
And we also know that the disease spreads through water in the rainy season.
Bacteria becomes active to increase moisture in the weather.
Cleanliness is very important at this time.
Pure drinking water should be consumed at this time.
It's okay, as much as we'll be careful, the disease will be as far away.
We want water, rain, but we want to save the disease.
My countrymen, we have recently started three new schemes, especially for the citizens of the country.
There are five hundred small towns in our country.
We have to take this effort forward.
And in this house, electricity, drinking water, toilets and nearby schools are required to study children.
When India completes 75 years of its independence in 2022, we want to give home to every countrymen.
I've been associated with you all with social media.
Several new ideas, suggestions and suggestions from you have been received from you.
However, when this government scheme becomes its own schemes of a person, society or village then how much its strength increases.
In the last few days, a Panchayat chief of Bibipur village in Haryana, Shree Sunil Jaglan Mahasay, has started a very funny effort.
And this has created an environment that every father should take a self with his daughter and post on social media.
The number of balloons in Haryana is very low.
There are about 100 districts in the country where there is such a situation, which is very worrying.
The worst situation in Haryana.
And that is why I urge you all to participate in the selfie with your daughters.
In order to strengthen the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme, write taglines, write beautiful taglines, it can happen in any language, English, Hindi, your mother tongue or any other language.
The tag line that will be inspiring, I will re-tweet your selfie with your daughter.
We all can unitely form the 'Beti Bachao Beti Padhao' scheme as a mass movement.
Make our country filthy.
I am telling you from my experience, this effort will take you forward.
Make it a part of your life.
One more thing is: Incredible India, wherever you go, you must send pictures there.
Our country, can the world know how many diversity we have in our country
I guess the pictures of handicrafts that you're sending are very low.
You can also post pictures of handicrafts in your area in Incredible India.
There are many things in your city - the poor people also produce many things.
And we have a simple medium with which we can reach.
My dear countrymen, this is all today.
The next Mann Ki Baat will talk to you again.
Some people sometimes feel that in Mann Ki Baat, I should announce big schemes of the government but not that.
I'm working day and night.
I am happy to have a slight meeting with you through this programme.
Mann Ki Baat, June 2019
You imagine what's going on in this middle time.
When I used to talk about Mann Ki Baat, I used to say that words were mine, sounds of throats were mine, but I used to say that you, men were yours, parameters were yours.
But this Sunday I've waited a lot.
Well, there's a chance to end.
In a household environment, Mann Ki Baat, a small mind that can be transformed in society and life, its sustainability will create a new zeal and this sustainability will continue to grow by strengthening the soul of a New India.
My silence with you was a part of this spiritual journey.
Many have asked me why I went to Kedarnath in the busyness of voting.
You have the right and I can understand you this curiosity.
I think I'm telling you sometimes about the situation of my time.
But today I feel that if I talk about it then the form of Mann Ki Baat will change.
Polling and guessing of votes, defeat and polling remains when I left.
Most of the people were found politically.
But for me this was an opportunity to meet myself.
I could say I was gonna meet me.
When can I say - I don't know, but I'll definitely say, because you have the right to me.
The way people have expressed their willingness to know about Kedar, this kind of positive power is your endeavour.
Sometimes some of your words drag my thoughts.
He also spoke of the challenges faced by the people of the country and the society, and addressed them immediately.
I have noticed that there is a problem in the letter, but there is also a feature that some solutions, some suggestions, some imaginations are given directly or indirectly.
If someone takes cleanliness, he expressed his concern over the waste and welcomed this effort towards cleanliness.
Whenever someone speaks about the environment, he also spoke of his own efforts while feeling affliction to pollution.
He also mentioned the measures being taken, and all the ideas he had inspired to prevent environmental pollution.
That is, the solution to the problem should be a glimpse of how it is possible to solve the entire society.
Mann Ki Baat is a mirror for the country and the society.
This tells us that there is no dearth of internal energy, capability and talent among the countrymen.
It's just necessary to drive that power and talent in the right way, to give opportunity and to use it.
Mann Ki Baat also tells us that the strength and activity of 130 crore Indians will be linked to the progress of the country.
I will definitely say another thing that Mann Ki Baat has a lot of letters, a lot of phones, a lot of messages, but there is a lot of complaints.
You can imagine, anybody writes to the Prime Minister of the country but doesn't want anything for yourself
This is an example of the high thinking of millions of people in the country.
Today my heart is full of happiness.
And that is why I had easily announced in Mann Ki Baat that after a few months I will come back to you again.
Let us take this idea forward to the sustainability of Mann Ki Baat.
When the necessary situation was implemented in the country, the movement against him was not confined to political circles, political leaders and prisoners.
I don't feel hungry when we can eat at night.
In the same way, the importance of the right of the Republic in everyday life is felt only when the right is looted.
And this is not because the Constitution of India has taken some steps to promote democracy.
Constitution and legislation are required to facilitate the society.
And that is why the country dedicated to a whole election, not for itself but for protecting democracy.
Recently, the greatest election process of democracy was completed in our country, where the richest and the poorest of the rich, all of them joined this campaign and decided to decide the future of the country.
When something is very close to us, we cannot achieve its importance.
More than 61 crore people voted in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in India, Sixty One crore
The number may seem to be simple, but if we look at the world's perception, I will say, without a Chinese, more people have voted in India than any population of the world.
The number of people who voted for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is more than the total population of America, almost double.
The total number of voters in India is more than the total population of Europe.
These are the symbols of the vastness and extension of our democracy.
The 2019 Lok Sabha elections are still the world's largest democratic election in history.
You can imagine what a massive organisation and human resource is needed to fulfil this process.
This election has been possible for the hard work of lakhs of teachers, officers and workers.
On the one hand, about three lakh security personnel of the Armed Forces have performed their responsibilities, while 20 lakh police personnel of different states have worked immensely.
As a result of their hard work, this time more polling was done than last election.
In this election process, about 10 lakh polling stations, more than 40 lakh EVM machines, more than 17 lakh VVPAT machines are arranged.
To ensure that no one is deprived of using his vote.
Polling stations have been built for only one female voters in a remote area of Arunachal Pradesh.
You will be surprised to know that the officers of the Election Commission have to travel for two days to reach that place.
This is the true honor of democracy.
This is the highest polling station in the world.
The polling station is at a height of 15,000 feet in Lahul-Spiti area of Himachal Pradesh.
There is also one more information that we can be proud of.
Perhaps for the first time in history, women have voted with enthusiasm like men.
The number of men and women voters is almost equivalent to this election.
One more inspiring information is that there are 78 women MPs in the Parliament, which is a record.
I congratulate the Election Commission and everyone associated with the electoral process and salute the conscious voters of India.
My dear countrymen, you will be listening to me several times - Not Bouquet, Book.
I had the desire to use the welcome if the book could be replaced by flowers
Another story that deepens my heart is Idgah.
The story is a child's condolences... a pure love for his grandmother.
When the four-five years of Hamid took the fair to his sister-in-law, it really seemed that the love of the human mind, the love of the human mind, the unprecedented, the unprecedented.
The last line of this story is an unprecedented truth of life in our thoughts and teachings.
A very heart touching story like Pus Ki Night.
The story shows the ironic pictures of the lives of a poor farmer.
The farmers are happy even after their crops are destroyed because they don't have to sleep in the fields in the winter.
Though these stories are almost centuries old, it still feels the relevance.
After reading the story, I feel another kind of feeling.
When it's about reading books, I read about Kerala's letters library.
You will be surprised to know that the library is located in a village in the deep forest of Idukki.
There's a primary school teacher P.
V. Chinnathampi had done extraordinary work for this library.
There was a time when the books were filled up and pressed on the back.
Today, this library is showing a new direction to everyone along with tribal children.
The Vanche Gujarat campaign of Gujarat is a successful initiative.
Millions of people from all ages participated in this campaign to read books.
In today's digital world, during the time of Google Guru, I would like to urge you to take some time out of your daily routine as well.
You will really enjoy and write to the Narendra Modi App about the books you read so that all the audience of Mann Ki Baat are aware of it.
My dear countrymen, I am very happy that the people of my country are thinking about all those things which are not only present but also a big challenge for the future.
I was reading your comments on the Narendra Modi App and MyGov and I saw that many people had spoken about the problem of water.
Belgavir Pawan Gowdai, Sitanshu Mohan Parida of Bhubaneswar, Yash Sharma, Shahab Altaf and many others have written about water related problems.
Water has a great impact on our culture.
Rikveda's Ap. Sukkkam has said about the water of Apo Hishta Mayo Bhub. Dadhatan, Maha Raney Chakshas Yo Bah Shivatmo Ras, Tasya Bhajayteh, Ushtiriv Matar.
Many parts of the country are being damaged every year due to lack of water.
You will be surprised to know that in a year, only 8 percent of the rainy water is conserved in our country.
Only 8 per cent.
But now it's time to solve this problem.
I believe that like other problems, through public participation, with the power of the people, with the strength of 130 crore countrymen, we will also find solutions to this crisis.
New Jal Shakti Ministry has been set up in the country keeping the importance of water in mind.
This will facilitate surveillance of all matters related to water.
A few days ago, I tried to innovate something different.
I wrote a letter to all the villagers of the country.
I had written to the villagers to save water, to save water, to save every drop of rain, to meet the villagers and to sit with the villagers.
I am glad that they have shown full enthusiasm in A-Mass and on 22nd A-Mass, millions of people have laboured in thousands of panchayats.
People in the villages have resolved to harvest one drop of water.
Today, I want to listen to a village panchayat in Mann Ki Baat.
Listen to the message of the Panchayat chief of Lupung village of Katkamshandi Block of Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand. My name is Dilip Kumar Ravidas, when the Prime Minister wrote our letter to save water, we did not believe that the Prime Minister wrote our letter.
The people of the country are ready to play their active role in water conservation once again.
My best wishes to all the village heads, to all the panchayat chiefs, to them for their activity.
There are several Panchayat heads across the country who have been engaged in water conservation.
What I said is possible to have a big positive outcome in every effort.
But everyone's goal is to save water, water conserve.
The work on water drain reform in Punjab is underway.
This has helped in preventing water accumulation.
The construction of a reservoir in the Thimaipalli of Telangana has transformed the lives of the villagers.
The construction of small ponds built in the fields of Kavir Dham in Rajasthan has made a big change.
I was talking about a massive effort in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, where 20,000 women have been in one place to save the river Nagan.
I was also studying about those women of Garhwal who are working very well to keep the rain water together.
Today, through the Mann Ki Baat programme, I have made three requests to the countrymen.
My first request is that just as the countrymen gave cleanliness a mass movement, let us start a mass movement for water conservation.
We all resolve to save every drop of water together. I believe that water is the form of prasad, water marble from God.
We launch a awareness campaign to save one drop of water.
Whether it is the world of cinema, the world of sports, the friends of the media, the people associated with the social organisation, the people associated with the cultural organisation, the artists of the dialogue, everybody should lead this movement through their own way.
Make the society awake, connect everyone and tied up.
You see, we can see changes in front of our eyes.
Let us make a list of water conservation related methods and inspire people to conserve water.
You all can share your content using Hashtag Janshakti4jalshakti.
My dear countrymen, I express my gratitude to you and to all the people of the world for another thing.
The way on 21st June, once again in Yoga Day, one family full of enthusiasm, three or four generations have celebrated Yoga Day together.
The importance of Yoga Day is increasing among the awareness about the Holistic Health Care.
If any Yoga lover welcomes the sun in every corner of the world, then his entire journey ends with sunset.
Presidents of various countries of the world, Prime Ministers, eminent personalities, ordinary people of the world have shown me on Twitter how they have celebrated Yoga Day in their own country.
That day, the world looked like a huge family full of happiness.
We all know, to create a healthy society, to create a healthy and sensitive person, Yoga ensures that.
Therefore, the spread and propagation of Yoga is an integral part of social service.
In 2019, the Prime Ministers Awards have been announced for the outstanding contribution in the promotion and development of Yoga, which must be grateful to me.
The award has been given to those organisations of the world who have played a crucial role in promoting and promoting Yoga.
Just like Japan Yoga Niketan, who has made Yoga very popular in Japan.
Japan Yoga Niketan is a number of institutions and training courses.
And where the matter is related to Yoga, can Indians be lagging behind
The Yoga School, Munger, Bihar, has been honoured for the past several decades.
Similarly, Swami Rajarshi Munike has also been honoured who established Life Mission and Lakulish Yoga University.
To celebrate Yoga and to honour those who have delivered the message of Yoga at home, these two are different in Yoga Day.
My dear countrymen, this journey of ours has started with new ideas, new feelings, new resolutions and new energy.
You can connect yourself with your thoughts. I am very important for me, Mann Ki Baat.
May your blessings be with me.
You are my inspiration, my strength.
Let us all sit together and listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme.
In the coming month, Mann Ki Baat will be held with you again.
Thank you very much, Namaskar.
Mann Ki Baat, February 2019
My heart is very heavy today by starting Mann Ki Baat.
Ten days ago, Mother India lost her brave children.
To tackle this challenge in front of the country, we all have to forget the ethnicity, communalism, regionalism and the rest so that we can take stronger, stronger and effective steps against terrorism than before.
Our armed forces introduce the indomitable courage.
You have seen what kind of action has been taken within 100 hours of terror.
The Army has taken a pledge to destroy the terrorists and their opponents.
After the martyrdom of the brave soldiers, there was an inspirational message from the media to their families, which inspires the people of the country to be the inspiration of immense courage, enthusiasm and energy.
Ramniranjan Ji, the father of Shaheed Ratan Tagore in Bhagalpur, Bihar, inspires all of us to inspire us.
He said that his other son will also be sent to fight the enemies of the country and will be present in the battlefield if necessary.
The entire nation is sacrificing the indomitable courage of the martyrdom of Jagatsinghpur of Odisha, the wife of Prasanna Sahu, Meenaji.
He took the pledge to contribute his only son to the CRPF.
When martyr Vijay Soren's dead body, covered by national flag, reached Gumla in Jharkhand, his younger son appears that he will join the army.
With the zeal of this innocent child, this solid commitment and idea today reflects the feelings of the young children of India.
My dear countrymen, the War Memorial that was waiting for all of us for such a long time of independence is going to end.
It is very natural for the people to have a lot of questions and experiences in this regard.
He was happy to note that Odupi, Karnataka Shri Onkar Shetty Ji National War Memorial was built at the Narendra Modi App.
I was surprised and sad that there was no national war memorial in India.
My dear countrymen, our former Prime Minister Morarjibhai Desai was born on February 29.
You all know that this special day comes once in four years.
In a simple and peaceful personality, Morarjivai was one of the most dedicated leaders of this country.
In this independent India, the record of presenting the budget in Parliament has been named after Morarji Bhai Desai.
During that difficult times, Morarji Desai gave India the right leadership when democracy of the country was in a drastic condition.
In order to protect this democracy, Morarjibhai Desai handed himself over to the movement against emergency.
And for this, he had to pay a lot of price even after coming to Bardhakya.
The government of that day captured him and imprisoned him.
However, when Janta Party won the vote in 1977, he became our Prime Minister.
During his presidency, the 44th Constitution Amendment was proposed.
The incident is very important because the 42nd Amendment for Emergency is proposed, where there were some proposals to discard the capability of the Supreme Court and to ruin our democratic values.
For example, the 44th Amendment Proposal provides an opportunity to publish all the functions of Parliament and Vidhan Sabha in the Press.
The Amendment proposes to maintain certain powers of the Supreme Court, as well as the fundamental rights of the citizens in the Article 20 and 21 of the Constitution should not be evacuated in any way due to the emergency.
Once again I pay my homage to this great leader.
My dear countrymen, like every year, there was a lot of curiosity in the minds of the people about the Padma Awards.
I want to tell you about some people like this today.
The Prime Minister said that he had done a surprising job to revive the Rogan Art of Kutch.
He has done a great job to bring this rare industry to the new generations.
I was present to former US President Barack Obama, the Tree of Life, built by Mr. Gufur.
Among the awardees, Sabbir Said of Marathwada is known as Gomata Sevak.
He is unique in the way he has delivered his life to the service of Goddess.
Madurai Chinna Pillai, a distinguished person who has tried to strengthen and self-sufficiently damaged and exploited through the Kalanjiyam Movement in Tamil Nadu.
He has been training all the people around the world at the age of 100 and has so far created 1500 Yoga teachers.
He has not only saved 50 hectares of forests, but has sent 10,000 women together to protect trees and wildlife.
As a result of this hard work of Yamuna ji, today the people of the village plant 18 trees at the time of birth of every child and 10 trees at the time of marriage of every girl.
The way he worked for the development of women with disabilities as well as Disabilities, he dedicated himself to the rejuvenation of making children self-reliant by creating an institution called 'Chhu Mahila Sevakunj'.
The real thing is that he has done the work of using technology along with agriculture and my dear countrymen, for the first time, this feeling is that among those who have been awarded the Padma Awards this year, there are 12 farmers.
Normally, very few people associated with the agriculture sector and very few of the farmers who are directly involved in the list of Padma Shri.
And this is the changing India's vibrant picture.
My dear countrymen, today I will tell you a heartfelt feeling with you all and I have achieved this thing myself for the past few days.
Today, I want to meet the beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat Yojana, PM-JYA and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
Brothers and sisters, About 12 lakh poor families have taken the opportunity of this scheme in the last five months.
I understand how many changes have been made in the lives of the poor.
If you know the poor people, who are unable to treat the poor, they are aware of this scheme.
This scheme has been implemented for the benefit of the poor.
My dear brothers and sisters, the school examination is going to start.
The Board of Education, Parliamentarians and 12th Category across the country will be preparing for examinations.
My heartiest congratulations to the examiners, their parents and teachers.
A few days ago, a huge event was held in the Town Hall Format in Delhi at Pariksha Pe Charcha.
All the students, their teachers, parents, YouTube can see the recording of this programme. I congratulate all the upcoming test takers and all those involved.
My dear countrymen, India will talk about it and it will not be worshipped.
Perhaps there is no day in our country where there is no festival or festival with the day or there is no special significance because we have thousands of years old heritage.
In a few days, Mahashivaratri is coming and this time Shivratri has fallen on Monday and Shivratri. On Monday and Shivratri falling together, our hearts are filled with special sacred emotions and devotion.
I am very impressed with the power of this disabled person.
My dear countrymen, I have a unique experience to connect with you all through Mann Ki Baat programme.
I face millions of families every month through radio.
Sometimes reading your letters, talking to you or listening to your phones, suggestions, I feel like you have made me one of your family.
It's a pleasure to me.
Friends, Electoral Festival is the biggest festival of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy with the elections.
Mann Ki Baat, January 2019
He had laid the foundation stone for people, shelter, education and spiritual knowledge.
The Siddhganga Math is organised by Agricultural Mela.
I once again pay homage to such a great man.

If anybody is unable to donate, then there should be a very cynical distress.
I would like to invite all the dignitaries of the country to enroll and make the public aware about the election day and registration of the Vehicle Voter College in Amras Bimele.

He used to utilize it.
I have arranged a museum so that the common man looks at it and inspires people to visit the museum.
The bravery of our heroes, the story of patriotism has made our younger generations vibrant use of different media.
I had visited Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 30th December this month.
But it was the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hinds government.
"Delhichlo", "You are our Lord, I am your Swachhtadeva" and "Delhichlo.
For a few years, Netaji's relevant films would be public.
I'm glad we've been doing this.
I am sure that he was in the residence of the Prime Minister of the family of Netaji.
I am aware of the weekly news of radio stations in English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengal, Marathi, Punjabi, Pushtu, Urduitya etc.
Vyas was an important landmass.
The museum has historical exhibition and has preserved the 450-year-old art works in it.
The artefacts of the great artisans like Amritashergil, King Biburma, Avanindranath Thakur, Gagan Thakur, Nandlal Bose, Jaminiray, Shailj Mukherjir are exhibited here.
He's building a lot of paintings.
He has also shared a lot of natural beauty among the animals and has also added thinhuman character to artistic medianvas.
And it was a wonderful story that none of these artefacts of Gurudev Vindranath Thaku did have any name.
Give me the ideals to the artists and the artisans.
Orpaintings are also visiting Russia and America in different countries of Europe.
I would like to visit your temple leaders.
My dear countrymen, the land of Indian saints.

South Asia Satellites has developed our neighbouring countries through an innovative enterprise.
They're in the households of cars.

Yeah, there's a few families in this test.
The teachers, their fathers, teachers, the teachers and all those who are related to the tests have suffered acute pain.

I would like to say this thing in this Mankibat programme today, but you will be happy to know that in the morning of 29th-January 11th, I would like to communicate with the examiners of our country.
I would like to share with my fellow friends, particularly the Stress Free Exams in the field of testing.
In this regard, I was aware of the opinions of the people and the great men of MyGov expressed their views on this matter.
Wherever we are, there is a two-minute tribute to the martyrs.
We will be able to commemorate the dreams of the revered Bapu ji, the creation of New India and the responsibility of the citizens.
Mann Ki Baat, December 2018
We are going to enter 2019.
Can we take initiatives to bring about change in our lives and bring forward the country and the society
My best wishes to all of you for 2019.

The world's distinguished organizations have acknowledged that India is moving towards making the country poverty free at a record pace.
The Swachhta Abhiyan is moving towards achieving 95 per cent of the goals through the unprecedented pledge of the countrymen.
After independence, the National Flag was flagged off from the Red Fort on the 75th anniversary of the Azad Hind Government.
The world's highest statue Statue of Unity was built in honor of the revered Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who had visited the country in the form of unity. This has illuminated India's name throughout the world.
India has been awarded the UN's highest environmental award Champions of the Earth.
The world has congratulated Indias efforts in the prevention of solar energy and climate change.

As a result of all the efforts, our country has achieved unprecedented success in the Ease of Doing Business rankings.

India won the 19th Cricket Games and Bland Cricket Games.
India has won a lot of medals in this Asian Games.
India's outcomes have also been very good in the Para-Asian Federation.
However, if I talk about the success and efforts of every Indian, then Mann Ki Baat will be so long that 2019 will start.
All these things have been done by the unprecedented efforts of 130 crore Indians.
My dear countrymen, in the month of December, we have lost some wonderful countrymen.
Dr. Jaya Chandran died in Chennai on 19th December.
Narasamma was a mother of pregnant mothers and sisters who helped her delivery.
He served thousands of mothers and sisters in Karnataka, especially in remote areas.
In the beginning of this year, he was honored with Padma Shri.
There are many pioneers like Dr. Jayachandran and Sulagiti Narasamma who have spent their lives for the welfare of the society.
When I talk about healthcare, I would like to mention the social efforts of the doctors in the business of Uttar Pradesh.
A few days ago, some members of my party tell me that some young doctors of the city are treating the poor free of cost by camping.
Now every month hundreds of poor people are benefiting from this camp.
The enthusiasm of these doctors and friends who are selflessly serving is commendable.
Today, I can proudly say that Swachh Bharat Mission has become a successful campaign because of our collective efforts.
Some people have told me that a few days ago, more than three lakh people joined the Swachhta Abhiyan in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
In this magnificence of Swachhta, municipality, voluntary organizations, school-college students, Amjata of Jabalpur, everyone participated with enthusiasm.
This is where I know about Dr. Jaya Chandran.
Whenever time comes, I try to know about such incentives by going to the Website The Better India.
I am glad that today there are several websites that inspire us to introduce the lives of inspirational people.
You can easily learn Sanskrit language by sitting at home through Sanskrit Bharati dot in.
I believe that many people will be able to know about these heroes who transform the society.
It is very easy to spread the negativity, but there is a lot of good work in our society around us and this is possible in the joint efforts of 130 crore Indians.
Every society has a different significance of sports.
Whenever there is a sport, the audience also feels inspired.
I want to talk about Hannaya Nisser, a girl from Kashmir, who won a gold medal in the Carat in Korea.
The twelve year old Hanya remains in the Anantnag of Kashmir.
I wish all the countrymen a bright future.
Royal best wishes and blessings for Hanaire.
Similarly, there is a lot of discussion in the media about another daughter, sixteen Rajni.
You must have read it.
Rajni won a gold medal in Golden Boxing of Girls of Girls.
He did it in honor of his father Jasmer Singh, who sold luxury at a waterway shop.
Rajni told her that her father had to confess a lot of sacrifice and suffering to reach this place.
Jasmer Singh went out to work every morning before he got up with Rajni and his brothers and sisters.
When Rajni wished to learn boxing to his father, he tried to enhance his zeal and achieve his dreams.
Rogery boxing practices started with old glasses, because the financial condition of his family wasn't good.
Despite all the adversities, Rajni did not lose courage and learned boxing.
He won a medal in Serbia.
I convey my best wishes and blessings to Rajini and congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usharani for staying with Rajini and encouraging her.
This month, Bedangi Kulkarni, a 20-year-old Pune, has achieved the pride of becoming the fastest Asian in the world in the cyclone.
He ran around 300 kilometres of cycles per day for 159 days.
You imagine, 300 kilometers of cycling every day
His indomitable zeal towards cycling is really commendable.
The adversity never hinders.
When we hear about such other examples, we also get inspiration in every moment of our life.
My dear countrymen, in the month of January, many festivals like Lohri, Pongal, Makar Sankranti, Uttarayan, Magha Bihu, Maghi etc.
In all these festivals, the color of traditional dance will be seen somewhere in India, somewhere in the joy of crops will be burnt with iron, somewhere in the sky, somewhere in the sky, somewhere in the Jamjmat Mela.
Somewhere sports will be organised and somewhere will be a festival of sweet sweetness to each other.
The name of these festivals is different, but the purpose of celebrating festivals is to be associated with agriculture and rural life in some way.
This is the time when the sun rises and the sun enters the rashi.
Since then, the day began to grow gradually and the day of the winter harvesting began.
On this occasion, I convey my best wishes to our Annadata farmer brothers and sisters.
The auspicious festival of this idea of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat' is in the midst of the unity of diversity.
We can see how closely these festivals are associated with nature.
In Indian culture, society and nature are not seen separately and there are people and groups.
One more beautiful example of our closeness with nature is the festival-based calendar.
These calendars also have details of planets along with festivals throughout the year.
These traditional calendars show how ancient our relationship with natural and psychological events.
As per the moon-surya calendar based on the speed of the moon and the sun, the dates of festivals and festivals are determined.
It depends on who follows a calendar.
In many places, the festival is fixed on the planet-drains.
Gudi-Padwa, Chetti-Chand, Ugadi, all these festivals are celebrated according to the lunar calendar like Tamil Puthandu and Vishnu, Vaishakh, Vaishakhi, Payala Vaishakh, Bihu etc.
Our aim is to conserve rivers and water in many mountains.
Chhat Parvati is connected to rivers and reservoirs with sun worship.
In Makar Sankranti, lakhs of people bath in the sacred rivers.
Our festivals also teach social values.
On the one hand, as they have a mythological significance, on the other hand, these festivals inspire each other to create brotherhood with each other in a very simple way.
I convey my best wishes and wishes to all of you for the year 2019.
Sharing photographs on this festival with all of you so that everyone can see the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
My dear countrymen, there are many things in our culture that we can be proud of and we can highlight the world and that is the Kumbh Mela.
You must have heard a lot about the Kumbh.
In many films, the fair has been depicted in various aspects of heritage and vastness and it is true that the form of Kumbh is greater and the richer, the more important.
People from all over the country and the world come to participate in the Kumbh.
The Kumbh Mela is supposed to be the zeal of faith and respect.
Millions of people from all over the country are joining together.
The tradition of Kumbh has been enriched and embraced by our great cultural heritage.
Saints and Mahatmas have already started reaching for the Kumbh Mela.
Last year, UNESCO has registered the Kumbh Mela in the list of Intensive Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago, the Ambassador of many countries had seen preparations for Kumbh.
There was a national flag hoisting of several countries together.
The Kumbh Mela organised in Prayagraj is likely to visit more than 150 countries.
This can be a big learning experiment especially for the youth.
I myself went to Prayagraj a few days ago and I saw that the Kumbh's strong preparations are going on.
The people of Prayagraj are very enthusiastic about Kumbh.
This time, there is a lot of emphasis on cleanliness in Kumbh.
This Akshaybat, a symbol of human faith, was closed in the fort for thousands of years, so pilgrims could not see it even if they wished.
Now the doors of Akshay Butt are opened for everyone.
My request to you is that when you go to Kumbh, you must share the different features and pictures of Kumbh in social media so that more and more people are inspired to visit Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of spirituality be the Mahakumbh of Indian philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith be the Mahakumbh of patriotism and national integrity.
My dear countrymen, the people of the country are very excited about the celebrations of Republic Day on 26th January and we remember those great people who gave our Constitution gifts.
This year we are celebrating 150th Birth Anniversary of revered Bapu.
Fortunately, the President of South Africa, Shri Siril Ramaphosa, is coming to India as the Chief Guest of the Republic Day.
There is an unbreakable bond of revered Bapu and South Africa.
South Africa is the place where Mohan became the Mahatma.
In South Africa, Mahatma Gandhi started the first Satyagraha and stood up against Vargavaishamya.
He had established Finix and Tolstoy Farm from where there was a voice for peace and satisfaction all over the world.
He had the power and inspiration to spend so many years in jail from the revered Bapu.
Mandela said, "Mahatma is an integral part of our history because here he used himself first in the path of truth.
There is a detailed discussion on the steps needed to strengthen the security of the country and the countrymen.
In this conference, I have announced the launch of Sardar Patel Award for National Unity, which will be given to those who have contributed in some way to national unity.
Sardar Patel dedicated his life to the unity of the country.
He has worked throughout his life to keep India's integrity intact.
He said the unity of the country is in the diversity of the country.
I would like to pay homage to Sardar Patel through this award of Unity.
My dear countrymen, the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh on January 13, 2019.
Guru Gobind Singh was born in Patna.
Most of his lives were North India, and he breathed his last in Nanded, Maharashtra.
Birth Anniversary Patna, Karmasthana, Uttar Pradesh and the last time of life in Nanded.
He was blessed by the entire India year.
According to Guru Gobind Singh, it is the greatest service to remove human sorrow.
He was full of valour, valour, sacrifice and devotion.
His extraordinary knowledge was in weapons and science.
He was a pilgrimage, a Gurumukhi, Braj language, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Hindi.
Once again I bow to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
My dear countrymen, there are some good events in the country which are not discussed in large numbers.
Several events are being organized across the country on the occasion of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
We are keen to create safe and healthy food habits.
As part of the Eat Right in India campaign, Swasth Bharat Yatra is being organised across the country.
The campaign will continue from 27th January.
India will be prosperous only when it becomes clean and healthy.
Nutritional diet is first required for good health.
Whether it is individual life or national life or social life, inspiration is the source of progress.
Let us move ahead with innovation, innovation, innovation, innovation, innovation, innovation, innovative goals, innovative goals and new heights.
Mann Ki Baat November 2019
The 50th edition of Mann Ki Baat was completed today.
Golden Jubilee Episode is called Golden Episode.
This is the 50th edition of all the letters and phones that have been received.
Through the MyGov App, Bhagukumar from Delhi, Kamalkumar from Patna to Vikas Yadav from Delhi, Manika Jain from Delhi, Government from West Bengal, Sangeeta Shastri from Nagpur have sent a similar question.
This question is very natural.
In today's era, when people almost forgot the radio, why did Modi bring the radio back
Now the shopkeeper said, listen to this radio.
I heard in the radio, there's talk about the bombing.
The shopkeeper window, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji said in the radio about the historic significance of the bomb blast, the historic significance of the nuclear bomb test, the information of that day.
I was wondering to see the joy of the shopkeepers, the people of this area, the hilly areas surrounded by snow and the jungles, these shopkeepers are listening to the radio all day.
I'm thinking of the radio communication research and its adverse effects.
After that, when I am the Prime Minister, I will take the help of the most powerful connectivity.
Since May 2014, when I began to take over the responsibility of the Chief Servant, I thought that the unity of our country, our glorious history, valour, diversity, cultural diversity, peoples work, their men, their emotions, sacrifices and penance should be spread to all the people of the country.
Every month, I have reached 50th Episode to read lakhs of letters, to listen to phone calls, to know about various apps and to simultaneously talk about my own fun.
The results of the survey are very encouraging.
Survey shows that the audience is listening to Mann Ki Baat, out of which seventy percent of the people have heard every episode of Mann Ki Baat.
Most of the people think Mann Ki Baat has enhanced positive thinking among all sections of the society.
Through Mann Ki Baat, the mass movement has achieved a lot.
There was a lot of discussion on Hass Tag India Positive.
This is a good change in which people are moving forward for social service.
Modi will come and depart but our country will continue and our culture will remain immortal.
These small carpets of 130 crore Indians will always be alive.
The new inspiration filled with enthusiasm will bring the country to a higher level.
I read letters and feel such a feeling among them and work in mind.
I have achieved two events myself and shared with them and shared with you all.
But who knows when these things reach home.
Sometimes the government will have so much power that a scheme like Selfie With Daughter is going to be started from a small village in Haryana, not only in the whole country, but in the whole world.
The people and celebrities of every section of the society have been associated with this thing and the thinking of the society has been described in a modern vision that illuminates the modern generation.
Sometimes it has been enjoyed with Mann Ki Baat but in my mind, 130 crore Indians have always been sitting.
Their mind is my mind.
Mann Ki Baat is not a government but it is a matter of society.
There are many aspects of social life among which politics is only one aspect.
Politics cannot be a reflection of a healthy society.
Sometimes political events or political people become so important that other talents or other entrepreneurs of the society are neglected.
It is our collective responsibility to take care of the talent of people and other things of the society for the bright future of a country like India and to move forward towards Mann Ki Baat.
I believe that Mann Ki Baat's 50th edition is the greatest achievement that you are not asking the Prime Minister, as if you are questioning one of your closest partners, this is democracy.
There's a toll free number - 1  7800, calling there and recording people's messages in their throats.
I am trying to read letters and statements as much as possible before Mann Ki Baat.
I heard a lot of phone calls.
This time, the Mann Ki Baat epidemic is moving forward, I keep on reading the ideas and ideas sent to you during the visit of various places.
It's not just a piece of paper for me.
Besides, I have spent nearly 40-45 years in one family and have gone to most of the districts of the country and I have spent a long time in remote districts of the country.
And that is why when I read a letter, I can easily connect myself with that place and time.
After that, I will notify some information like the village, the name of the person.
In fact, in Mann Ki Baat, it is myself but for example, emotions and life force are my countrymen and I would like to thank all those who have contributed to Mann Ki Baat.
There are lakhs of people whose name I have not been able to take Mann Ki Baat till date, but they are not desperate to send their letters and their comments.
I am confident that your message will come to me manifold more than before and will make Mann Ki Baat more entertaining, effective and useful.
It is also tried that all the letters which are not included in the Mann Ki Baat programme should also be taken care of by the concerned department.
I would like to thank all the media of Akashwani, Doordarshan, other TV channels, social media friends.
Mann Ki Baat is reaching the highest number of people in their hard work.
Thus, they became Narendra Modi for thirty minutes.
I congratulate them for their talents and skils, thank them.
I urge you all to listen to this event in your regional language.
I also thank all the media friends who are regularly spreading Mann Ki Baat in their channels.
No political person is disappointed with the media, thinks he is very less covered or a negative coverage, but the media has made many issues published in Mann Ki Baat.
Without your help, this journey of Mann Ki Baat was incomplete.
Nidhi Ji, thank you very much for your phone call.
Normally I say I don't have any mystery.
What I'm doing maybe in every family.
In a simple language, I try to create myself like those youngsters, keep myself in that situation and keep them in line with their opinion and try to make a wave length match.
We have some old baggages in our lives, if they don't come forward, it's easy to understand anyone.
I don't know any of the two, how one of them has confessed to others except his thoughts.
The best quality of the present youth is that he doesn't believe himself, and when he believes in something, everything left behind him.
People often talk about the communication gap between the elders and the teenagers of the family.
However, most of the families are discussing limited matters with teenagers.
Sometimes there is talk of reading or habits, lifestyle, do it, don't do it.
It is also a matter of concern that there is a gradually decreasing interaction in the family without making any conditions.
Any media has the importance of adopting hope and deliberately deliberately.
Through various programmes and social media, I have been communicating with the youth.
I always learn from the thoughts of the youth.
Young people have different ideas.
Young people are entrepreneurs, innovatives and incentives.
Someone said that young students want to work together.
I say, what's wrong with this
They're transparent in multi-tasking, so they do this.
If we look around, we will see a big change in the society, be it social initiatives, start-ups, sports or any other sector.
Those young men who have dared to question and dream.
If we can quit the ability to decide on the youth and if they can openly express their thoughts then they can bring about a constructive change in the country and they are doing it.
My dear countrymen, from Gurugram to MyGov, Binita ji wrote on the website that this time Mann Ki Baat should say something about the Constituent Day of November 26th.
This is a special day because we are entering the seventeenth year of the Constitution of India.
Binita ji, thank you very much for your advice
Yes, tomorrow's Constitution Day.
Those who have created our Constitution, remember all those great personalities.
Our Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949.
It took two years 11 months and 17 days to complete this historic task of drafting the Constitution.
Imagine, within three years, these great talented persons have given us such a comprehensive and comprehensive Constitution.
The extraordinary pace that they have constructed the Constitution is a unique example of time management and productivity today.
Inspired by this, we are also brilliant to finish our responsibilities in record time.
The Constituent Assembly was a gathering of great talented people of the country and was committed to providing a Constitution to every country so that the people of India become empowered and the poorest of the poor.
The main feature of our Constitution is that here the rights and duties are detailed in detail.
The balance of these two things will take the country forward in the lives of the citizens of the country.
If we respect each other's rights, then you will also be protected by your rights and in the same way, if we do our duties in the Constitution then our right to protect ourselves will also be fulfilled.
I remember that in the year 2010, in the 60 years of India's democracy, we used to take a pretext by putting a constitution on the back of the elephant.
It was a memorable effort to make the youth aware about the Constitution and to make them interested in various streams of their Constitution.
As a democratic country in 2020, we are going to complete 70 years and in 2022, 75 years of our independence will be completed.
Let us all respect the value of our Constitution and ensure peace, progress, prosperity, that is, peace, progress and prosperity in our country.
Babasaheb Ambedkar.
On December 6, his Mahaparinirvana Diwas.
On behalf of all the countrymen, I salute Babasaheb who has given the right to save crores of Indians in honour.
The Republic was under the thinking of Babasaheb and he used to say that India's democratic ideals are not external.
The recognition of the legislative system was nothing new for India.
In the Constituent Assembly, he had requested an emotional appeal that we have achieved this freedom after a long struggle and that is why we have to protect it from the last point of our blood.
He added that the ideas of the welfare of the country should always be prioritized as we Indians grow in different environments.
Once again I pay my homage to Babasaheb.
My dear countrymen, two days ago, on 23rd November, we all celebrated the birth anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev and will celebrate his 550th Prakash Parv in 2019.
Shri Guru Nanak Dev always wished the welfare of humanity.
He has always shown the path of truth, work, service, compassion and harmony to the society.
Our country will celebrate the 550th Birth Anniversary of Shri Guru Nanak Dev in the coming year, which will spread across the world by printing the country.
All the States and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate this day with great fanfare.
Similarly, the 550th Prakash Parv of Shri Guru Nanak Dev will be celebrated all over the world.
A train will also be run in all the holy places associated with Shri Guru Nanak Dev.
Recently, when I was discussing this thing, I remember Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
In 2001, this Gurudwara was severely damaged during the earthquake in Gujarat, but the way the state government revived the Gurudwara with the local people.
The Government of India has taken an important decision to build the Kartarpur corridor so that the travellers of our country can easily visit the holy land of Shri Guru Nanak Dev in Kartarpur, Pakistan.
My dear countrymen, after the 50th phase, we will meet again on the next Mann Ki Baat and I believe that the thoughts I had about Mann Ki Baat were first in front of you because you people wanted to know it.
Our journey will continue.
This journey will be deeper and satisfactory as much as I can be your courage.
Sometimes a question arises in the minds of the people, what did I get from Mann Ki Baat
Today, I want to say that the feedback of Mann Ki Baat has touched my heart, most people have said that when they listen to the Mann Ki Baat programme in their family, they feel like the family members are sharing their words with them.
When I came to know that I am very happy to know that I am one of you, one of you, one of you and you have made me big, and I will come again and again through Mann Ki Baat as a member of your family.
Your sweetheart, I'm sweet.
Come on, let's take this journey forward.
Mann Ki Baat, October 2018
I wish all of you must participate in this race of unity in large numbers.
About six and a half months before independence, the films of Sardar Patel were published in the edition of the famous International Paper Time edition on 27 January 1947.
The Time Service has given a design of India in its Lid Story.
There were more than 550 indigenous states.
Though the interest of the British about India was overwhelming, they wanted to snatch this country.
The Time writes that the threats like separation, violence, food crisis, value addition and powerful politics are snatching India, but if anyone has the power to unite the country, then it is Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
Gandhiji told Sardar Patel that the problems of the states are so dangerous that you can solve it alone.
Sardar Patel really solved the problems and showed the country the unlimited impact of unity.
Whether it is Junagadh or Hyderabad, Tribankur or Rajasthan, Sardar Patel was the only person to see intellectual and strategic strategy.
If we look at this nation binding unity, our mother India, then it is natural to remember the sacred memory of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
On 31st October, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel is more important because on this day we will hand over the Statue of Unity to the nation as a tribute to him.
The statue established on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat is double the Statue of Liberty in America.
This will be the world's highest architecture.
Every Indian can proudly say that the world's highest statue is now in India.
I believe that this special architecture will be identified as a favourite philosophy across the country.
This is the day when the soldiers of the Indian Army landed in Kashmir and protected the valley from the investors.
This historic event is also related to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.
I was reading an old meeting of the great soldiers of India Samekash.
In this meeting, Field Marshal Manekash spoke of the time when he was Colonel.
At that time, a military operation was started in Kashmir in 1947.
Field Marshal Manekash said that during the meeting, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was distressed to be delayed in sending troops to Kashmir, Sardar Patel looked at Manekash in his habitual meeting and said that no delay in military operations in Kashmir is going to be done and solving this problem as soon as possible.
Our former Prime Minister, Smt. Indira Gandhi, on October 31, 2019.
I pay homage to Indiraji.
My dear countrymen, are there people who don't like sports
Spirit, Stamina, Strength, Skill etc. are important in the field of sports.
These are the measurements of the success of any sportsperson.
On the other hand, these four qualities are important for nation building.
If these qualities are among the youth of any country, they will not only improve the economy, science and technology of the country but also showcase the country's victory in sports.
Recently, I had two meetings, which are worth remembering.
First, I got the opportunity to meet the Para athletes who participated in the ASEAN Para Games 2018 at Jakarta.
India has won 72 medals in this game and has added honour to the nation.
We have won 3 more medals in 13 additional Mix Events.
You must remember that this time India's exhibition was very good in the Asian Federation.
Look, in the last few minutes, I have used the best, most beautiful words so far.
He was a father at the age of eight.
The next eight years he spent in an orphanage.
After leaving Annathashram, he worked to clean the DTC bus and wash the roadside doorsteps.
This Narayana has won a gold medal for India at the international event today.
Not only this, the field of sports in India is spreading such an extension that where India has not received any Olympic medals at the Judo or the Senior Level, Tawabi Devi has made a new history of winning the medal in Judo at Youth Olympics.
Sixteenth year old young woman Tawabi Devi lives in a village in Manipur.
Her father sold a day-to-day and mother fish.
Sometimes there was a situation that they didn't even have the money to buy food.
This kind of situation has also been defeated by Tawabi Devi's inspiration.
He has made history of winning medals for the country.
There are many other artists, their lives are the source of inspiration.
Every young sportsperson, his zeal is an introduction to New India.
My dear countrymen, you all remember that we have successfully organised the FIFA UNDER 17 WORLD CUP in 2017.
It has also been complimented among the most successful integrations of the world.
FI FA UNDER 17 WORLD CUPRECKORD broke the number of audience.
More than 12 lakh visitors have seen footballs in various stadiums of the country and have encouraged young sportspersons.
This time, India has got the opportunity of the World Cup Hockey Organisation in Bhubaneswar.
The Hockey World Cup will be held from 28th November to 16th December.
Any Indian who loves sports, has a different place in their minds.
India has a golden history in the Hockey Games.
In the past, India has won gold several times and has won a victory once.
India has also gifted some world-class players in Hockey Games.
If there is a discussion on Hockey at any place in the world then it will remain incomplete.
Hockey's magic Major Dhyanchand is the world's identity.
Besides, Balvindar Singh Senior, Lesley Cladias, Mohammad Saheed, Dhanraj Pillai Hockey from Udham Singh has brightened Indias name in the world.
Even today, the hockey players of Team India are making an example of success for the new generations in labour and dedication.
The sportspersons have a great experience of sitting at the stadium and watching the game.
While visiting Bhubaneswar, it will encourage not only Indian teams but all countries.
There is a heritage of prosperity and cultural excellence and the people of Odisha have to remember and inspire.
Orissa is also a good opportunity for sports lovers.
I convey my best wishes to the rest of the world.
My dear countrymen, many people are moving forward in the work of social service, valentiering, they are becoming an inspiration for the people of the country.
A young man has also made a commitment to learn wheelchair basketball to play basketball in wheelchair.
This is the mindset, this is self-employment, this is the mission mode activity.
There will be an Indian who will not be proud of this.
This feeling will inspire all of us.
My dear brothers and sisters, this time when I had seen your proposals about Mann Ki Baat, I got the opportunity to see a thrilling statement from Shri Manish Mahapatra of Puducherry.
He wrote in MyGov: Please talk about Mann Ki Baat on how the people of India and their traditions are the best examples of unity with nature.
There is a need to learn from what we will reaffirm their legacy for the sustainable development.
I express my gratitude to you for keeping this thing in front of the audience of Mann Ki Baat.
This is one thing that I inspire us to see our glorious past and culture, today the world, particularly the Western countries are discussing environmental conservation and finding a new way for its balanced lifestyle.
Today, our India is not far from this problem, but we have to absorb ourselves to solve it.
Our tribal brothers and sisters worship plants and flowers like gods and goddesses.
The Bhil tribe of Madhya Pradesh, particularly the people of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh worship trees like Butt, Arjun.
In the desert like Rajasthan, Vishnoi has shown us the way for environmental protection.
They're ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve trees, but they're not ready to acknowledge the loss of a tree.
The Mishmis of Arunachal recognised their relationship with the tiger.
They mean to call him their brothers and sisters.
In Nagaland, the tiger is seen as the protector of the forest.
The people of the Worli community of Maharashtra consider the tiger as the guests, and their presence is a symbol of prosperity.
The Kola community of Madhya Pradesh means that their fate is linked to the tiger and if the tiger does not get food, then the villagers must be devoid of it.
The Gond Tribal of Madhya India stops fishing at some places in the Keen river in the Breeding Season.
These places are the refugees of the fishes and the tradition of fresh fishing is abundant.
Tribal communities build their homes from natural materials, which are strong and environment friendly.
In southern India, there is a small jewellery community in the desert areas of Nilgiri Mountain Thora, who built their settlements at the local level according to tradition.
My dear brothers and sisters, it is true that the tribal community believes in being very peaceful and together, but whenever someone harms their natural resources, they are not afraid to fight for their rights.
It is not surprising that among our first freedom fighters, tribals were also there.
Who can forget Lord Veerasa Munda, who fought hard against British rule to protect his wilderness.
There are many examples of the tribal community who can save us with the nature of teaching us and our country is borrowed to the tribal community for the forest wealth that remains near us.
Come on, we respect them.
My dear countrymen, during the Mann Ki Baat programme, we talk about those people and their problems who are doing some extraordinary work for the society.
The work that looks simple, but in fact it has an adverse effect on the change of our mindset and the goal of the society.
A few days ago, I was reading about Guru Bachan Singh Ji of Punjab.
A common and labourer farmer was married to Gurubachan Singh ji.
Prior to this marriage, Gurubachan Singh-Goner told the parents that they will marry in Anadambare.
Then he suddenly said he had a condition.
Nowadays, in marriage, it seems usually that he's going to talk about a big punna, ask for something that will make the family of Connor difficult.
But you will be surprised to know that brother Gurubachan Singh was a simple white-siddhi farmer, he told Kaneer's father the real power of the society.
Gurubachan Singh ji said, You should talk to me, from now on you do not heat the remains of the crop after harvest.
You can imagine how big social power is hidden.
Guru Bachan Singh ji feels very extraordinary but it is his personality and we have seen that there are many such families in our society who have transformed personal matters into the good work of society.
The family of Shri Gurubachan Singh Ji has set an example like this.
I read about Kallar Majra, another village in Punjab, which is near the Navar.
Kallar Majra was in the forefront because the people there did not burn the rice pigeon and mix it with the ground.
My best wishes to brother Gurubachan Singh Ji.
My best wishes to the people of Kallar Majra and those places who are making their best efforts to free the environment.
You all are taking the healthy lifestyle of Indian heirs on the right path.
The way the sea is generated by drops of water, such small awareness and positive work always helps in creating a positive environment.
For India, there is a special significance of the day of 11th November this year as the first war was completed in 11th November a hundred years ago.
That is, the end of that terrible destruction and destruction will be 100 years.
The first war for India is an important event.
Indeed, we had no connection with this great epic.
In spite of this, the soldiers of our country have fought with braveness in this war, have played a very big role and have made maximum sacrifices.
Indian soldiers showed the world that they were not behind anyone in the battlefield.
Our soldiers have shown their valour in the inaccessible areas.
It was the only purpose of restoring peace.
In the first war, the whole world looked at destruction.
It is estimated that nearly one crore soldiers and more civilians lost their lives.
After this horrific war, the entire world was aware of the importance of peace.
In the last hundred years, the language of peace has changed.
My dear countrymen, there is a specialty in the North-East of the country.
The natural beauty here is unprecedented and the people here are very talented.
Our North-East is now known for the best and great work.
This is a place where organic farming has improved a lot.
A few days ago, Sikkim won the Honourable Future Policy Gold Award for promoting sustainable food systems.
The award was conferred on behalf of the United Nations FAO Economic Food and Agricultural Organization.
You will be happy to know that the award for the best policy formulation in this specific field is like Oscar.
Not only this, our Sikkim has won this award by losing one and a half nominations in 25 countries.
For which I thank the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, the month of October is about to end.
Weather changes are being explained.
With the change of weather, the season of the festival has also come. Dhanteras, Deepawali, Bhai Phota, Chhat Puja can be said that the month of November is also the month of festivals.
My best wishes to every countrymen for all the festivals.
I urge you to take care of yourself during the festival, look at your health and look at the well-being of the society.
Your progress is an important part of the country's progress.
The country will proceed as much as you move.
