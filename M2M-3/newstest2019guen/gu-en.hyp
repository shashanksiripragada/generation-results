How can the darshan language of Sultan Mahmood Gazni of such a Gazni be Sanskrit for the Bhajak of Somnath temple and for the common Indian
In fact, the research of the historian of Delhi University, Shanta Pandey, has made it clear that the Rajbhasha of Gazni was Sanskrit.
When Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for the service of Sanskrit, Sanskrit was only a Lok Sabha, it was natural to have a simple question that it was only the language of the so-called high class Brahmins.
Pandit Gulam Dastagir Virdar of Mumbai was remembered.
The 87-year-old Pandit Viradar, who spoke in such a simple Sanskrit that can be understood by Riksha, is still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the sacred uran.
The word 'Kuran' is Sanskrit from his vision.
The sound of ueen ueen, the sound of humidity, the sound of humidity, the sound of the soil.
Not only this, he himself learned in the school of Solapur, but today he is among the great Sanskrit scholars of the country.
However, while spending a simple life, Panditji does not seek to describe himself as a scholar of Sanskrit in the United States or other countries to market himself.
The princess of Thailand is a pundit of Sanskrit.
Sanskrit reads itself there.
To learn Sanskrit from the United States, enthusiasts have to go to Bone University in Germany.
Apart from Banaras Hindu University in India only the dignitaries of PHD of Sanskrit are also written in the language of the state itself .
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught only in Gujarati but it should be remembered that education in Takshila and Nalanda universities was provided through Sanskrit.
Prof. Shanta Pandey, the prevalence of Sanskrit in Afghanistan, has said that the Darbari language of the Sultan of Gazni was not only Sanskrit but it has also mentioned the coins of his money in Sanskrit.
The coins also mention that Mahmood Suratan has been marked by the imports of uran in Sanskrit and the creator of Sanskrit interpretation Pani is a resident of Shalapur in Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru has said that in the philosophy of Maru Hind, a vast edition of Sanskrit language came down from the Sanskrit Sanskrit in the capability and sustainable strength of Afghan and teachings.
Now everyone acknowledges that not only Indian languages but also Indo-European languages have come down from Sanskrit.
Dr. Ambedkar National Language Members of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and some other Muslim and South Indian Legislative Assembly, had proposed to make Sanskrit a national language.
In the constituent assembly of English against Hindi on September 13 , 1949 when discussions about national language were held then the Vice President of India Dr . B . . . Kaskar and Nazaruddin Ahmad were those who proposed Sanskrit national language .
In view of the day-long discussion and the report published in the National Herald of 11th September, 1949, Sanskrit Language is estimated.
Even today, we have not been able to decide any national language.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, have the status of official language in our Constitution, not national language alone.
As per the population of 2011, Sanskrit has now been the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country, we have kept Sanskrit in a state like a tumor of beauty.
Honble Prime Minister Nehru of Nehru Toky Sanskrit also spoke with great respect to Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
In the context of his book, he has turned to Sanskrit and detailed the importance of Sanskrit that the scholars of the world have preserved: In the year 1874, Sir Williams Johns said, "Sanskrit language is so old, God knows, but its creation is amazing.
It is complete, more vast than Latin and more vulnerable than both in Greek language.
Nehru adds: I don't know how long Sanskrit has become a dead language, that is, since Kayar he has died as a Lok Sabha.
Today, as a Sanskrit language prayer or a Parliamentarian, there has been only a language to swear by members like Union Minister Smriti ubin Irani.
We need to revive the year of Sanskrit and make it alive and democratic.
If Israel's dead language Hibru can be revived then Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is the guilt if it is shown to make it a Lok Sabha or if an effort is made seriously instead of conservative efforts.
