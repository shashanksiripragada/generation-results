Did the philosopher read a shock
How can Khalnayak become the courtier language of Sultan Mahmood Gazni of such a Gazni for the demonstrators and common Indians of Somnath Temple be Sanskrit
In fact, from the research of Professor Shanta Pandey, historian of Delhi University, it has become clear that Gazni's Rajbhasha was Sanskrit.
Recently, when Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai for the service of Sanskrit, Sanskrit was only a Lokbhasha that it was only a language of so-called high-level Brahmins.
Pandit Gulam Hastigir of Mumbai was remembered.
The 87-year-old scholars who speak in such a simple Sanskrit as well as those who have rickshaws are still giving a final shape to the Sanskrit translation of the sacred uran.
The word sacred uran is Sanskrit from his point of view.
u Ran i. e.
Not only this, he is also included in the great Sanskrit scholars of the country who have studied in Solapur's school today.
However, while spending a simplicity of life, Panditji does not seek to interpret as a scholar of Sanskrit in the United States or other countries to make his own marketing.
The princess of Thailand is a scholar of Sanskrit.
Sanskrit teaches itself there.
To learn Sanskrit from the United States, eager people have to go to Bone University in Germany.
In India, in most of the Universities, besides Banaras Hindu University, there is also the dignity of the PHD of Sanskrit which is written in the language of the state.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit education is given only in Gujarati but it should be remembered that education was given in Takshashila and Nalanda universities through Sanskrit medium.
Prof. Shanta Pandey, the preaching of Sanskrit in Afghanistan, has said that the court language of the Sultan of Gazni was not only Sanskrit but also the coins of his money in Sanskrit.
Panday noted that these coins are marked by the imports of Kurran in Sanskrit on Mohammad Suratran and Panini, a resident of Shalapur in Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru has said in the philosophy of Maru Hind, a vast version of Sanskrit language has come down from Sanskrit, the Afghan and the Pushtu language of the readers in the sustainable power.
Now everyone acknowledges that not only Indian languages but also Indo-European languages have come down from Sanskrit.
Babasaheb Ambedkar, the chief constituent of the Constitution and some other Muslim and South Indian members proposed to make Sanskrit a national language of the country.
In the Constituent Assembly of English against Hindi on 13 September 1949, when there was a discussion about national language in Sanskrit, Vice Foreign Minister Dr. B.V. Keskar and Nazruddin Ahmad were among those who proposed national language to Sanskrit.
The discussion of that day and the report published in the National Herald of 11th September 1949 is estimated to be the brutality of the Sanskrit language.
We have not been able to decide any national language even today.
22 Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, have a position in our Constitution as Official Language, but no national language is one.
According to the 2011 population, Sanskrit is now being the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country. We have kept Sanskrit in a position like a glimpse of beauty.
Honble Prime Minister Nehru of Nehru Thakki Sanskrit also spoke very respectfully about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
In the epics related to his book, it has turned to Sanskrit and the significance of Sanskrit by the scholars of the world has been elaborated: Sir Williams Johns in the year 1874 said, "How old is Sanskrit language that God knows, his construction is amazing.
It's fuller than the Greek language, more virtuous than the Latin and more virtuous than that.
Nehru says: "I do not know how many times Sanskrit has become a dead language, i. e.
Now the language of Sanskrit language prayer or as a Parliamentarian has been merely the language of swearing by members like Union Minister Smriti Irani.
We need to preserve the year of Sanskrit and make it alive and Lokbhasha.
If the dead language of Israel can be revived again, then Sanskrit is still a living language.
To make it a Lokbhasha or to make it a very serious effort instead of symbolic efforts, only Ganimat.
