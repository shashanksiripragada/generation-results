Regional-English translation (Romanization)
When the word is written in English, there is some serious problem in the field of 'AT', 'D' etc.
There are several systems to tackle it, one of them is the use of diactric identification.
The standard of diacritic identification has not been fixed for writing.
Its use is limited to this cause and torture.
In one of its simple streams, only eight diacritic identifications can be written in all the cars.
These are the Unicode Indicators of Extended Roman Class.
They have to use decimal codes to enforce them.

As per the list, English will have to be sworn first, then the Alt key will be sworn in a neumerical capad on the edge of a ten-minute code.
Nam Lakh keys should be given to activate the neumerical keypad.
English fonts like ARL or Times New Roman should also be used because there are no signs in all fonts.
These marks cannot be properly identified in the World Pressers like Liber Office Rights or Microsoft Words, so we have to copy-paste in Notpads or Worldpads.
At the same time, two diacritics will have to be given, such as a car and a moonlight will have to be given two idols and idols.
Now there is no use of swords, but it has been used in old swords, so that the swords can be used once again to re-examine the subject, and sworn here for the sword-in-English diacritics list and use information.

Convert [For Operating System] - Gist Passmacker File Data can be converted into Unicode in batch mode with help.
For Correction (Correction) [Operating System] - Old Correction Bit Funds are converted to Unicode, many times BW and Y and those results are overlooked with the help of this programme.
